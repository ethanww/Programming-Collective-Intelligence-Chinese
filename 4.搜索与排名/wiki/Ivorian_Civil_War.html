<p><a name="Context_of_the_conflict" id="Context_of_the_conflict"></a></p>
<h2>Context of the conflict</h2>
<p>The civil war revolves around a number of issues, particularly:</p>
<ul>
<li>The end of the 30-year presidency of <a href="/wiki/F%C3%A9lix_Houphou%C3%ABt-Boigny.html" title="Félix Houphouët-Boigny">Félix Houphouët-Boigny</a> forced the nation to grapple with the democratic process for the first time. Houphouët-Boigny had been president for the 33 years since independence, and so the nation's political system was bound tightly to his myth, charisma, and political and economic competence. The political system was forced to deal with open, competitive elections without Houphouët-Boigny for the first time in 1994.</li>
<li>The large number of foreigners in Cote d'Ivoire, and Ivorians of somewhat recent foreign descent, created an important issue of voting rights. 26% of the population was of foreign origin, particularly from <a href="/wiki/Burkina_Faso.html" title="Burkina Faso">Burkina Faso</a>, a poorer country to the north. Many of these had been Ivorian citizens for 2 generations or more, and some of them, of Mandinka heritage, can be considered native to the northern part of what is now known as Cote d'Ivoire. These <a href="/wiki/Ethnic_tension.html" title="Ethnic tension">ethnic tensions</a> had been suppressed under the strong leadership of Houphouët-Boigny, but bubbled to the surface after his passing. The term <i><a href="/wiki/Ivoirity.html" title="Ivoirity">Ivoirity</a></i>, originally coined by <a href="/wiki/Henri_Konan_B%C3%A9di%C3%A9.html" title="Henri Konan Bédié">Henri Konan Bédié</a> to denote the common <i>cultural</i> identity of all those living in Côte d'Ivoire came to be used by <a href="/wiki/Nationalism.html" title="Nationalism">nationalist</a> and <a href="/wiki/Xenophobia.html" title="Xenophobia">xenophobic</a> politics and press to represent solely the population of the southeastern portion of the country, particularly <a href="/wiki/Abidjan.html" title="Abidjan">Abidjan</a>.</li>
<li>Discrimination toward people of <a href="/wiki/Burkinab%C3%A9.html" title="Burkinabé">Burkinabé</a> origin made neighbor countries, particularly Burkina Faso, fear a massive migration of refugees.</li>
<li>An economic downturn due to a deterioration of the terms of trade between <a href="/wiki/Third_World.html" title="Third World">Third World</a> and <a href="/wiki/Developed_countries.html" title="Developed countries">developed countries</a> worsened conditions, exacerbating the underlying cultural and political issues.</li>
<li>Unemployment forced a part of the urban population to return to the fields where they discovered that earth was exploited by immigrants.</li>
</ul>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Rising tensions">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Rising_tensions" id="Rising_tensions"></a></p>
<h2>Rising tensions</h2>
<p>Violence was turned initially against African foreigners. Indeed, the prosperity of the Côte d'Ivoire attracted many Africans from West Africa, who constituted in 1998 26% of the population, 56% of whom were <a href="/wiki/Burkina_Faso.html" title="Burkina Faso">Burkinabés</a>.</p>
<p>In this atmosphere of increasing racial tension, Houphouët-Boigny's policy of granting nationality to Burkinabés resident in Côte d'Ivoire was criticized as being solely to gain their political support.</p>
<p>In 1995, the tensions turned violent when Burkinabés were killed in plantations at <a  class="new" title="Tabou">Tabou</a>, at the time of racial riots.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Catalyst to the conflict">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Catalyst_to_the_conflict" id="Catalyst_to_the_conflict"></a></p>
<h2>Catalyst to the conflict</h2>
<p>The catalyst for the conflict was the law quickly drafted by the government immediately before the elections of <a href="/wiki/2000.html" title="2000">2000</a> which required both parents of a presidential candidate to be born within Côte d'Ivoire. This excluded the northern presidential candidate <a href="/wiki/Alassane_Ouattara.html" title="Alassane Ouattara">Alassane Ouattara</a> from the race. Ouattara represented the predominantly Muslim north, particularly the poor immigrant workers from <a href="/wiki/Mali.html" title="Mali">Mali</a> and <a href="/wiki/Burkina_Faso.html" title="Burkina Faso">Burkina Faso</a> working on <a href="/wiki/Coffee.html" title="Coffee">coffee</a> and <a href="/wiki/Cocoa.html" title="Cocoa">cocoa</a> plantations.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Civil war">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Civil_war" id="Civil_war"></a></p>
<h2>Civil war</h2>
<p>In the early hours of <a href="/wiki/September_19.html" title="September 19">September 19</a>, <a href="/wiki/2002.html" title="2002">2002</a> troops, who were mainly originally from the north of the country, mutinied. They launched attacks in many cities, including Abidjan. By lunchtime they had control of the north of the country. Their principal claim relates to the definition of who is a citizen of Ivory Coast (and so who can stand for election as President), voting rights and their representation in government in <a href="/wiki/Abidjan.html" title="Abidjan">Abidjan</a>. On the first night of the uprising former president Robert Guéi was killed. What happened exactly that night is confused. The government said he had died leading a coup attempt, and state television showed pictures of his body in the street; it was widely claimed that his body had been moved after his death and that he had actually been murdered at his home, with fifteen other people. Alassane Ouattara took refuge in the French embassy; his home was burned down.</p>
<p>The events in Abidjan shows that it is not a tribal issue, but a crisis of transition from a dictatorship to a democracy, with the clashes inherent in the definition of citizenship.</p>
<p>Forces involved in the conflict include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Official government forces, the National Army (FANCI), also called <i>loyalists</i>, formed and equipped essentially since <a href="/wiki/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a></li>
<li>The <i>Young Patriots</i>: <a href="/wiki/Nationalist.html" title="Nationalist">nationalist</a> groups aligned with president <a href="/wiki/Laurent_Gbagbo.html" title="Laurent Gbagbo">Laurent Gbagbo</a></li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Mercenaries.html" title="Mercenaries">Mercenaries</a> recruited by president Gbagbo:
<ul>
<li>allegedly, <a href="/wiki/Belarus.html" title="Belarus">Belarusians</a></li>
<li>some former combatants of <a href="/wiki/Liberia.html" title="Liberia">Liberia</a>, including under-17 youths, forming the so-called "Lima militia" <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://hrw.org/english/docs/2005/03/30/cotedi10404.htm">[1]</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><i>New Forces</i> (Forces Nouvelles, FN), ex-northern rebels, who hold 60% of the country</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/France.html" title="France">French</a> forces: troops sent within the framework of <a  class="new" title="Operation Unicorn">Operation Unicorn</a> and under <a  class="new" title="UN mandate">UN mandate</a> (<a href="/wiki/UNOCI.html" title="UNOCI">UNOCI</a>), 3000 men in February 2003 and 4600 in November 2004;</li>
<li>Soldiers of the <a  class="new" title="CEDEAO">CEDEAO</a>, <i>White helmets</i>, also under the UN.</li>
</ul>
<p>The rebels were immediately well armed, not least because to begin with most were serving soldiers; it has been claimed that they were also given support by Burkina Faso. Additionally, government supporters claimed that the rebels were supported by <a href="/wiki/France.html" title="France">France</a>; however, the rebels also denounced France as supporting the government, and the French forces quickly moved between the two sides to stop the rebels from mounting new attacks on the south. It was later claimed that the rebellion was planned in Burkina Faso by soldiers of the Ivory Coast close to General Guéï. <a href="/wiki/Guillaume_Soro.html" title="Guillaume Soro">Guillaume Soro</a>, leader of the <a  class="new" title="Patriotic Movement of Côte d'Ivoire">Patriotic Movement of Côte d'Ivoire</a> (MPCI) later to be known as the New Forces – the rebel movement– comes from a <a href="/wiki/Student_union.html" title="Student union">student union</a> close to the FPI of Gbagbo, but was also a substitute for an RDR candidate in the legislative elections of 2000. <a  class="new" title="Louis Dacoury Tabley">Louis Dacoury Tabley</a> was also one of the leaders of the FPI.</p>
<p>Once they had regrouped in Bouake, the rebels quickly threatened to move southwards to attack Abidjan again. France deployed the troops it had based in Ivory Coast, on <a href="/wiki/September_22.html" title="September 22">September 22</a>, and blocked the rebels' path. The French said they had acted to protect their nationals and other foreigners, and they went into the northern cities to bring out ex-patriots from many nations. The <a href="/wiki/USA.html" title="USA">USA</a> gave (limited) support.</p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/October_17.html" title="October 17">October 17</a>, a <a href="/wiki/Cease-fire.html" title="Cease-fire">cease-fire</a> was signed, and negotiations started.</p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/November_28.html" title="November 28">November 28</a>, the popular Movement of the Ivory Coast of the Great West (MPIGO) and the Movement for Justice and Peace (MJP), two new rebel movements, took the control of the towns of <a href="/wiki/Man%2C_C%C3%B4te_d%27Ivoire.html" title="Man, Côte d'Ivoire">Man</a> and <a href="/wiki/Danan%C3%A9.html" title="Danané">Danané</a>, both located in the west of the country. France conducted negotiations.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: September 2002">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="September_2002" id="September_2002"></a></p>
<h2>September 2002</h2>
<p>Attacks were launched almost simultaneously in most major cities; the government forces maintained control of Abidjan and the south, but the new rebel forces had taken the north and based themselves in Bouake.</p>
<p>Laurent Gbagbo considered deserters from the army, supported by interference from Burkina Faso, as the cause of destabilization. The principal difference in interpretation related to defence. The consequence is that Paris wished for reconciliation, when the Côte d'Ivoire government wanted military repression.</p>
<p>Paris sent 2500 soldiers to man a peace line and requested help from the <a href="/wiki/United_Nations.html" title="United Nations">United Nations</a>.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: The Kléber (Marcoussis) agreements">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="The_Kl.C3.A9ber_.28Marcoussis.29_agreements" id="The_Kl.C3.A9ber_.28Marcoussis.29_agreements"></a></p>
<h2>The Kléber (Marcoussis) agreements</h2>
<p>To bring parties together, the parties signed a compromise at <a href="/wiki/Linas.html" title="Linas">Linas</a>-<a  class="new" title="Marcoussis">Marcoussis</a> (see <a  class="new" title="Kléber agreements">Kléber agreements</a>) on <a href="/wiki/January_26.html" title="January 26">January 26</a> <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.reliefweb.int/rw/rwb.nsf/db900SID/EVIU-63HHAD?OpenDocument&amp;rc=1&amp;cc=civ">[2]</a>. President Gbagbo was to retain power, opponents were invited into a government of reconciliation and obtained the ministries for Defense and the Interior. Soldiers of the CEDEAO and 4000 French soldiers were placed between the belligerents - a <i>peace line</i>. The parties agreed to work together on modifying national identity, eligibility for citizenship, and land tenure laws which many observers see as among the root causes of the conflict.</p>
<p>As of <a href="/wiki/February_4.html" title="February 4">February 4</a>, anti-French demonstrations took place in Abidjan, in support for Laurent Gbagbo. The end of the civil war was proclaimed on <a href="/wiki/July_4.html" title="July 4">July 4</a>. An attempt at a <a href="/wiki/Putsch.html" title="Putsch">putsch</a>, organized from France by Ibrahim Coulibaly (FPI), was thwarted on <a href="/wiki/August_25.html" title="August 25">August 25</a> by the French secret service.</p>
<p>The UN authorized the formation of the <a href="/wiki/UNOCI.html" title="UNOCI">UNOCI</a> on <a href="/wiki/February_27%2C_2004.html" title="February 27, 2004">February 27, 2004</a>, in addition to the French forces and those of the CEDEAO.</p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/March_4.html" title="March 4">March 4</a>, the PDCI suspended its participation in the government, being in dissension with the FPI (President Gbagbo's party) on nominations to office within the administration and in public companies.</p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/March_25.html" title="March 25">March 25</a>, a peace march was organized to protest against the blocking of the Marcoussis agreements. Demonstrations had been prohibited by decree since <a href="/wiki/March_18.html" title="March 18">March 18th</a>, and the march was repressed by the armed forces: 37 died according to the government, between 300 and 500 according to Henri Konan Bédié's PDCI. This repression caused the withdrawal from the government of several opposition parties. A UN report of <a href="/wiki/May_3.html" title="May 3">May 3</a> estimated at least 120 dead, and implicated highly-placed government officials.</p>
<p>The government of national reconciliation, initially composed of 44 members, was reduced to 15 after the dismissal of three ministers, amongst them <a href="/wiki/Guillaume_Soro.html" title="Guillaume Soro">Guillaume Soro</a>, political head of the rebels, on <a href="/wiki/May_6.html" title="May 6">May 6</a>. That involved the suspension of the participation in the national government of the majority of political movements.</p>
<p>The French consequently were in an increasingly uncomfortable situation. The two sides each accused France of siding with the other: the loyalists because of its protection of the rebels, and the non-implementation the agreements of defense made with the Côte d'Ivoire; the rebels because it was preventing the capture of Abidjan. On <a href="/wiki/June_25.html" title="June 25">June 25</a>, a French soldier was killed in his vehicle by a government soldier close to <a href="/wiki/Yamoussoukro.html" title="Yamoussoukro">Yamoussoukro</a>.</p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/July_4.html" title="July 4">July 4</a>, 2003, the government and New Forces militaries signed an "End of the War" declaration, recognized President Gbagbo's authority, and vowed to work for the implementation of the LMA and a program of Demobilization, Disarmament and Reintegration (DDR).</p>
<p>2004 saw serious challenges to the Linas-Marcoussis Accord. Violent flare-ups and political deadlock in the spring and summer led to the Accra III talks in <a href="/wiki/Ghana.html" title="Ghana">Ghana</a>. Signed on <a href="/wiki/July_30.html" title="July 30">July 30</a>, <a href="/wiki/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a> the Accra III Agreement reaffirmed the goals of the LMA with specific deadlines and benchmarks for progress. Unfortunately, those deadlines – late September for legislative reform and October 15 for rebel disarmament – were not met by the parties. The ensuing political and military deadlock was not broken until November 4, 2004.</p>

<h2>The resumption of fighting</h2>
<p>But the timetable was not respected. The bills envisaged in the process were blocked by the FPI, the Ivoirian National Assembly. The conditions of eligibility for the presidential poll were not re-examined, because Laurent Gbagbo claimed the right to choose a prime minister, not in accordance with agreements suggested in Accra. Faced with political <i>impasse</i>, the disarmament whose beginning had been envisaged fifteen days after the constitutional modifications did not begin in mid-October.</p>
<p>A sustained assault on the press followed, with newspapers partial to the north being banned and two presses destroyed. Dissenting radio stations were silenced.</p>
<p>UN soldiers opened fire on hostile demonstrators taking issue with the disarmament of the rebels on <a href="/wiki/October_11.html" title="October 11">October 11</a>. The rebels, who took the name of <i>New Forces</i> (FN), announced on <a href="/wiki/October_13.html" title="October 13">October 13</a> their refusal to disarm, citing large weapons purchases by the Côte d'Ivoire national army (FANCI). They intercepted two trucks of the FANCI full of heavy weapons travelling towards the demarcation line. On <a href="/wiki/October_28.html" title="October 28">October 28</a>, they declared an emergency in the north of the country.</p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/November_4.html" title="November 4">November 4</a>, the new FANCI planes, apparently manned by <a href="/wiki/Belarus.html" title="Belarus">Belarusian</a> <a href="/wiki/Mercenary.html" title="Mercenary">mercenaries</a>, began a bombardment of <a href="/wiki/Bouak%C3%A9.html" title="Bouaké">Bouaké</a>. On <a href="/wiki/November_6.html" title="November 6">November 6</a>, FANCI planes bombed a French base in Bouaké, supposedly by accident, killing nine French soldiers and an American aid worker and injuring 39 others. The French forces responded by destroying both <a href="/wiki/Sukhoi_Su-25.html" title="Sukhoi Su-25">Sukhoï fighter-bombers</a> based at Yamoussoukro, 15 minutes after the attack. <a href="/wiki/Jacques_Chirac.html" title="Jacques Chirac">Jacques Chirac</a> gave the order to destroy five other <a href="/wiki/Helicopter.html" title="Helicopter">helicopters</a>. One hour after the attack on the camp, French forces established control of the airport of Abidjan. Simultaneously, the Young Patriots of Abidjan (see <a href="/wiki/Politics_of_C%C3%B4te_d%27Ivoire.html" title="Politics of Côte d'Ivoire">politics of Côte d'Ivoire</a> for more details), rallied by the State media, plundered possessions of French nationals. Rapes, beatings, and murders followed. Several hundred Westerners, mainly French, took refuge on the roofs of their buildings to escape the mob, and were then evacuated by helicopters of the French Army. France sent in reinforcements of 600 men based in <a href="/wiki/Gabon.html" title="Gabon">Gabon</a> and <a href="/wiki/France.html" title="France">France</a> while foreign civilians were evacuated from Abidjan airport on French and Spanish military airplanes.</p>

On <a href="/wiki/November_13.html" title="November 13">November 13</a>, President of the Ivorian National Assembly <a  class="new" title="Mamadou Coulibaly">Mamadou Coulibaly</a> (FPI) declared that the government of the Ivory Coast did not take any responsibility in the bombardment of <a href="/wiki/November_6.html" title="November 6">November 6</a>, and announced its intention of approaching the <a href="/wiki/International_Court_of_Justice.html" title="International Court of Justice">International Court of Justice</a>:</p>

<p>In an interview with the Washington Post, Laurent Gbagbo called into question even the French deaths. Lastly, on the morning of <a href="/wiki/November_13.html" title="November 13">13 November</a>, 2600 expatriate French had returned to France, and 1600 other European expatriates had left.</p>
<p>The United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 1572 (2004) on <a href="/wiki/November_15.html" title="November 15">November 15</a>, enforcing an arms embargo on the parties.</p>

This area has a mixture of <a href="/wiki/Ethnic_groups.html" title="Ethnic groups">ethnic groups</a>, notably the <a href="/wiki/Dioula.html" title="Dioula">Dioula</a> (who are predominantly <a href="/wiki/Muslim.html" title="Muslim">Muslim</a> and typically aligned with the <i>New Forces</i>), who typically sway to both government and rebel loyalties.

<p>This is not to say that there are no regions where ethnic groups co-exist peacefully, however, the UN troops lack the man-power to prevent inter-ethnic violence. <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/4556335.stm">[8]</a></p>
