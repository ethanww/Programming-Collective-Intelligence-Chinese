He was concurrently <a href="/wiki/Hanover_%28state%29.html" title="Hanover (state)">Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg</a>, and thus Elector (and later King) of Hanover. The Electorate became the <a href="/wiki/Kingdom_of_Hanover.html" title="Kingdom of Hanover">Kingdom of Hanover</a> on <a href="/wiki/October_12.html" title="October 12">12 October</a> <a href="/wiki/1814.html" title="1814">1814</a>.

It has been popularly speculated that he suffered from the blood disease <a href="/wiki/Porphyria.html" title="Porphyria">porphyria</a>, along with other British monarchs. Recently, owing to studies showing high levels of the poison <a href="/wiki/Arsenic.html" title="Arsenic">arsenic</a> in King George's hair, arsenic is also thought to be a possible cause of King George's insanity and health problems. After a final relapse in 1811, George's eldest son, <a href="/wiki/George_IV_of_the_United_Kingdom.html" title="George IV of the United Kingdom">George, Prince of Wales</a> ruled as <a href="/wiki/Prince_Regent.html" title="Prince Regent">Prince Regent</a>.

<h2>Early life</h2>
<p>His Royal Highness Prince George of Wales was born prematurely at <a href="/wiki/Norfolk_House.html" title="Norfolk House">Norfolk House</a> in <a href="/wiki/London.html" title="London">London</a> at 7:45 A.M. on <a href="/wiki/June_4.html" title="June 4">June 4</a>, <a href="/wiki/1738.html" title="1738">1738</a>. He was the son of <a href="/wiki/Frederick%2C_Prince_of_Wales.html" title="Frederick, Prince of Wales">Frederick, Prince of Wales</a>, and the grandson of <a href="/wiki/George_II_of_Great_Britain.html" title="George II of Great Britain">George II</a>. Prince George's mother was <a href="/wiki/Augusta_of_Saxe-Gotha.html" title="Augusta of Saxe-Gotha">Augusta of Saxe-Gotha</a>.</p>
<p>Because Prince George was born prematurely, he was baptised that same day at Norfolk House by the <a href="/wiki/Bishop_of_Oxford.html" title="Bishop of Oxford">Bishop of Oxford</a>, <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Secker.html" title="Thomas Secker">Thomas Secker</a>. He was publicly baptised again at Norfolk House by Secker, on <a href="/wiki/July_4.html" title="July 4">4 July</a> <a href="/wiki/1738.html" title="1738">1738</a>. His godparents were the <a href="/wiki/Frederick_I_of_Sweden.html" title="Frederick I of Sweden">King of Sweden</a> (for whom <a href="/wiki/Charles_Calvert%2C_5th_Baron_Baltimore.html" title="Charles Calvert, 5th Baron Baltimore">Lord Baltimore</a> stood proxy), the <a href="/wiki/Frederick_III%2C_Duke_of_Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg.html" title="Frederick III, Duke of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg">Duke of Saxe-Gotha</a> (for whom the <a href="/wiki/James_Brydges%2C_1st_Duke_of_Chandos.html" title="James Brydges, 1st Duke of Chandos">Duke of Chandos</a> stood proxy) and the <a href="/wiki/Sophia_Dorothea_of_Hanover.html" title="Sophia Dorothea of Hanover">Queen of Prussia</a> (for whom Lady Charlotte Edwin, a daughter of the <a href="/wiki/James_Douglas%2C_4th_Duke_of_Hamilton.html" title="James Douglas, 4th Duke of Hamilton">Duke of Hamilton</a>, stood proxy).</p>
<p>George II and the Prince of Wales had an extremely poor relationship. His mother, now the Dowager Princess of Wales, mistrusted her father-in-law; thus, she kept the Prince of Wales separate from his grandfather. In 1751 the Prince of Wales died from a lung injury, and Prince George became the <a href="/wiki/Duke_of_Edinburgh.html" title="Duke of Edinburgh">Duke of Edinburgh</a>. The new Duke of Edinburgh was <a href="/wiki/Heir_Apparent.html" title="Heir Apparent">Heir Apparent</a> to the Throne, and was subsequently created <a href="/wiki/Prince_of_Wales.html" title="Prince of Wales">Prince of Wales</a>. An important influence on the new Prince of Wales' childhood was <a href="/wiki/John_Stuart%2C_3rd_Earl_of_Bute.html" title="John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute">John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute</a>, who would later serve as <a href="/wiki/Prime_Minister.html" title="Prime Minister">Prime Minister</a>.</p>

<h2>Marriage</h2>
<p>George, Prince of Wales inherited the Crown when his grandfather, George II, died on <a href="/wiki/October_25.html" title="October 25">25 October</a> <a href="/wiki/1760.html" title="1760">1760</a>. After his accession, a search throughout <a href="/wiki/Europe.html" title="Europe">Europe</a> ensued for a suitable wife. On <a href="/wiki/September_8.html" title="September 8">8 September</a> <a href="/wiki/1761.html" title="1761">1761</a>, the King married <a href="/wiki/Charlotte_of_Mecklenburg-Strelitz.html" title="Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz">Duchess Sophia Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Chapel_Royal.html" title="Chapel Royal">Chapel Royal</a>, <a href="/wiki/St._James%27s_Palace.html" title="St. James's Palace">St. James's Palace</a>, London. A fortnight later, both were crowned at <a href="/wiki/Westminster_Abbey.html" title="Westminster Abbey">Westminster Abbey</a>. Queen Charlotte was a descendant, through as many as six lines, of Margarita de Castro e Sousa, a Portuguese noblewoman who lived in the 15th century. Castro was a descendant of the 13th-century monarch <a href="/wiki/Alfonso_III_of_Portugal.html" title="Alfonso III of Portugal">Alfonso III of Portugal</a> and his mistress, <a href="/wiki/Madragana.html" title="Madragana">Madragana</a>, who was known as Alfonso's <a href="/wiki/Moors.html" title="Moors">Moor</a>. Castro was an ancestor of most northern European royals, including George III.</p>
<p>It is said that George was smitten with <a href="/wiki/Lady_Sarah_Lennox.html" title="Lady Sarah Lennox">Lady Sarah Lennox</a>, daughter of <a href="/wiki/Charles_Lennox%2C_2nd_Duke_of_Richmond.html" title="Charles Lennox, 2nd Duke of Richmond">Charles Lennox, 2nd Duke of Richmond</a>, and actually winced when he first saw the homely Charlotte, whom he met on their wedding day. However, he gamely went ahead with his marriage vows, and, remarkably, never took a mistress (in contrast with both his Hanoverian predecessors and his sons). The couple enjoyed a genuinely happy marriage. They had 15 children—nine sons and six daughters—more than any other British monarch. Two of his sons became Kings of the United Kingdom; another became solely King of Hanover; a daughter became Queen of Württemberg.</p>

<p>George was, falsely, said to have married a <a href="/wiki/Religious_Society_of_Friends.html" title="Religious Society of Friends">Quakeress</a> named <a href="/wiki/Hannah_Lightfoot.html" title="Hannah Lightfoot">Hannah Lightfoot</a> on 17 April 1759, prior to his marriage to Charlotte.

<h2>American Revolution</h2>
<p>The rest of the 1760s was marked by bureaucratic instability, which led to denunciations of George III by the Whigs as an autocrat in the manner of <a href="/wiki/Charles_I_of_England.html" title="Charles I of England">Charles I</a>. The incompetent <a href="/wiki/Lord_Bute.html" title="Lord Bute">Lord Bute</a> (who had probably been appointed only because of his agreement with George's views on royal power) resigned in 1763, allowing the Whigs to return to power. Later that year, the British government under George III issued the <a href="/wiki/Royal_Proclamation_of_1763.html" title="Royal Proclamation of 1763">Royal Proclamation of 1763</a> that placed a boundary upon the westward expansion of the American colonies. The Proclamation's goal was to force colonists to negotiate with the Native Americans for the lawful purchase of the land and, therefore, to reduce the costly frontier warfare that had erupted over land conflicts. The Proclamation Line, as it came to be known, was incredibly unpopular with the Americans and ultimately became another wedge between the colonists and the British government, which would eventually lead to war. With the American colonists generally unburdened by British taxes, it was becoming increasingly difficult for the crown to pay for its military excursions and the defense of the American colonies from native uprisings. So, after <a href="/wiki/George_Grenville.html" title="George Grenville">George Grenville</a> became Prime Minister, he introduced the <a href="/wiki/Stamp_Act_1765.html" title="Stamp Act 1765">Stamp Act</a>, which levied a <a href="/wiki/Stamp_duty.html" title="Stamp duty">stamp duty</a> on all printed paper in the British colonies in North America. Grenville attempted to reduce George III to a mere puppet. The King requested <a href="/wiki/William_Pitt%2C_1st_Earl_of_Chatham.html" title="William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham">William Pitt the Elder</a> to accept the office of Prime Minister, but was unsuccessful. George then settled on <a href="/wiki/Charles_Watson-Wentworth%2C_2nd_Marquess_of_Rockingham.html" title="Charles Watson-Wentworth, 2nd Marquess of Rockingham">Charles Watson-Wentworth, 2nd Marquess of Rockingham</a>, and dismissed Grenville in 1765.</p>

<p>Lord Rockingham repealed Grenville's unpopular Stamp Act. He faced considerable internal dissent, and was replaced in 1766 by <a href="/wiki/William_Pitt%2C_1st_Earl_of_Chatham.html" title="William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham">William Pitt</a>, whom George created <a href="/wiki/Earl_of_Chatham.html" title="Earl of Chatham">Earl of Chatham</a>. Lord Chatham proved to be pro-American, criticising his colleagues' harsh attitudes towards the American colonists. George III, however, deemed that the chief duty of the colonists was to submit to him and to Great Britain and he resented the Americans' rebellious attitude. Lord Chatham fell ill in 1767, allowing <a href="/wiki/Augustus_Henry_Fitzroy%2C_3rd_Duke_of_Grafton.html" title="Augustus Henry Fitzroy, 3rd Duke of Grafton">Augustus Henry Fitzroy, 3rd Duke of Grafton</a> to take over government, although he did not formally become Prime Minister until 1768. Political attacks led him to leave office in 1770, once again allowing the Tories to return to power.</p>
<p>The government of the new Prime Minister, <a href="/wiki/Frederick_North%2C_Lord_North.html" title="Frederick North, Lord North">Frederick North, Lord North</a>, was chiefly concerned with the <a href="/wiki/American_Revolution.html" title="American Revolution">American Revolution</a>. The Americans grew increasingly hostile to British attempts to levy taxes in the colonies. During the <a href="/wiki/Boston_Tea_Party.html" title="Boston Tea Party">Boston Tea Party</a> in 1773, a <a href="/wiki/Boston%2C_Massachusetts.html" title="Boston, Massachusetts">Boston</a> mob threw 342 crates of <a href="/wiki/Tea.html" title="Tea">tea</a> into Boston Harbour as a political protest, costing over $1 million. In response, Lord North introduced the <a href="/wiki/Intolerable_Acts.html" title="Intolerable Acts">Punitive Acts</a>, known as the Coercive Acts or the Intolerable Acts by the colonists. The Port of Boston was shut down and legislative elections in the <a href="/wiki/Massachusetts.html" title="Massachusetts">Colony of Massachusetts Bay</a> were suspended.</p>
<p>Armed conflict broke out in America in 1775. Some delegates to the <a href="/wiki/Second_Continental_Congress.html" title="Second Continental Congress">Second Continental Congress</a> drafted a peace proposal known as the <a href="/wiki/Olive_Branch_Petition.html" title="Olive Branch Petition">Olive Branch Petition</a>, but fighting had already erupted when the document arrived in Britain. On <a href="/wiki/July_4.html" title="July 4">July 4</a>, <a href="/wiki/1776.html" title="1776">1776</a> (<a href="/wiki/American_Independence_Day.html" title="American Independence Day">American Independence Day</a>), the colonies declared their independence from the Crown. The <a href="/wiki/United_States_Declaration_of_Independence.html" title="United States Declaration of Independence">Declaration of Independence</a> made several political charges against the British king, legislature, and populace. Amongst George's other offences, the Declaration charges, "He has abdicated Government here … He has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people." On the same day, George III wrote "Nothing important happened today" in his diary.<sup title="The text in the vicinity of this tag needs citation." class="noprint">[<a  title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><i>citation&#160;needed</i></a>]</sup> While itself not indicative of George III's opinion of the Declaration, as communication at the time was not instantaneous, this statement has been used by fiction writers as a comment on historical irony.</p>
<p>George III was indignant when he learned of the opinions of the colonists. Although in the subsequent <a href="/wiki/American_Revolutionary_War.html" title="American Revolutionary War">American Revolutionary War</a> Great Britain fared well to begin with, the tide turned after the surrender of the British Lieutenant-General <a href="/wiki/John_Burgoyne.html" title="John Burgoyne">John Burgoyne</a> at the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Saratoga.html" title="Battle of Saratoga">Battle of Saratoga</a>. In 1778, France signed a treaty of friendship with the new United States. Lord North asked to transfer power to William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham, whom he thought more capable. George III, however, would hear nothing of such suggestions; he suggested that Chatham serve as a subordinate minister in Lord North's administration. Chatham refused to cooperate, and died later in the same year. Great Britain was then at war with France, and in 1779 it was also at war with Spain.</p>
<p>George III obstinately tried to keep Great Britain at war with the rebels in America, despite the opinions of his own ministers. <a href="/wiki/Granville_Leveson-Gower%2C_1st_Marquess_of_Stafford.html" title="Granville Leveson-Gower, 1st Marquess of Stafford">Granville Leveson-Gower, 2nd Earl Gower</a> and <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Thynne%2C_1st_Marquess_of_Bath.html" title="Thomas Thynne, 1st Marquess of Bath">Thomas Thynne, 3rd Viscount Weymouth</a> both resigned rather than suffer the indignity of being associated with the war. Lord North advised George III that his opinion matched that of his ministerial colleagues, but stayed in office.</p>
<p>In 1781, the news of <a href="/wiki/Charles_Cornwallis%2C_1st_Marquess_Cornwallis.html" title="Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis">Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis</a>' capitulation reached London; the Tory Lord North subsequently resigned in 1782. George III accepted the defeat in North America, and authorized the negotiation of a peace. The <a href="/wiki/Treaty_of_Paris_%281783%29.html" title="Treaty of Paris (1783)">Treaty of Paris</a> and the associated Treaty of Versailles were ratified in 1783. The former treaty provided for the recognition of the new United States by Great Britain.

<p>Several changes were made to the structure of the British government after the loss of the colonies. Since 1660, there had been two chief cabinet officials, the <a href="/wiki/Secretary_of_State_for_the_Southern_Department.html" title="Secretary of State for the Southern Department">Secretary of State for the Southern Department</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Secretary_of_State_for_the_Northern_Department.html" title="Secretary of State for the Northern Department">Secretary of State for the Northern Department</a>. The former was responsible for Southern England, Ireland, and relations with non-Protestant European nations, and the latter for Northern England, Scotland, and relations with Protestant European nations. The Secretary of State for the Southern Department was formerly responsible for the colonies, but this responsibility was transferred to the <a href="/wiki/Secretary_of_State_for_the_Colonies.html" title="Secretary of State for the Colonies">Secretary of State for the Colonies</a> in 1768. All three positions were abolished after the British lost in North America. They were replaced with two new positions, the <a href="/wiki/Secretary_of_State_for_Foreign_Affairs.html" title="Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs">Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs</a> (Foreign Secretary) and <a href="/wiki/Secretary_of_State_for_the_Home_Office.html" title="Secretary of State for the Home Office">Secretary of State for the Home Office</a> (Home Secretary).</p>
<p>In 1782, after 12 years in office, the ministry of Lord North ended. The Whig Lord Rockingham became Prime Minister for the second time, but died within months. The King then chose <a href="/wiki/William_Petty%2C_2nd_Earl_of_Shelburne.html" title="William Petty, 2nd Earl of Shelburne">William Petty, 2nd Earl of Shelburne</a> to replace him. <a href="/wiki/Charles_James_Fox.html" title="Charles James Fox">Charles James Fox</a>, however, refused to serve under Lord Shelburne, and demanded the appointment of <a href="/wiki/William_Henry_Cavendish-Bentinck%2C_3rd_Duke_of_Portland.html" title="William Henry Cavendish-Bentinck, 3rd Duke of Portland">William Henry Cavendish-Bentinck, 3rd Duke of Portland</a>. In 1783, the House of Commons forced Lord Shelburne from office and his government was replaced by the <a href="/wiki/Fox-North_Coalition.html" title="Fox-North Coalition">Fox-North Coalition</a>. The Duke of Portland became Prime Minister; Fox and Lord North, Foreign Secretary and Home Secretary respectively, really held power, with the Duke of Portland acting as a figurehead.</p>
<p>George III was distressed by the attempts to force him to appoint ministers not of his liking. But the Portland ministry quickly built up a majority in the House of Commons, and could not be easily displaced. He was, however, extremely dissatisfied when the government introduced the India Bill. Immediately after the House of Commons passed it, George informed the House of Lords that he would regard any peer who voted for the bill as his enemy. On <a href="/wiki/December_17.html" title="December 17">17 December</a> <a href="/wiki/1783.html" title="1783">1783</a>, the bill was rejected by the Lords; on the next day, the Portland ministry was dismissed, and <a href="/wiki/William_Pitt_the_Younger.html" title="William Pitt the Younger">William Pitt the Younger</a> was appointed Prime Minister. George III dissolved Parliament in March 1784; the subsequent election gave Pitt a firm mandate.</p>

<h2>William Pitt</h2>
<p>For George III, Pitt's appointment was a great victory. The King felt that the scenario proved that he still had the power to appoint Prime Ministers without having to rely on any parliamentary group. Throughout Pitt's ministry, George eagerly supported many of his political aims. To aid Pitt, George created new peers at an unprecedented rate. The new peers flooded the House of Lords and allowed Pitt to maintain a firm majority.</p>
<p>During Pitt's ministry, George III was extremely popular. The public supported the exploratory voyages to the <a href="/wiki/Pacific_Ocean.html" title="Pacific Ocean">Pacific Ocean</a> that he sanctioned. George also aided the <a href="/wiki/Royal_Academy.html" title="Royal Academy">Royal Academy</a> with large grants from his private funds. The British people admired their King for remaining faithful to his wife, unlike the two previous Hanoverian monarchs. Great advances were made in fields such as in <a href="/wiki/Science.html" title="Science">science</a> and <a href="/wiki/Industry.html" title="Industry">industry</a>.</p>
<p>George III's health, however, was in a poor condition. He suffered from a mental illness, now strongly believed to be a symptom of <a href="/wiki/Porphyria.html" title="Porphyria">porphyria</a>. (A 2004 study of the King's hair samples revealed extremely high levels of <a href="/wiki/Arsenic.html" title="Arsenic">arsenic</a>, a possible trigger of the disease <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/3889903.stm">[2]</a> and <a  class="external text" title="http://aolsvc.news.aol.com/news/article.adp?id=20050722092109990013">2005 publication</a>). The King had previously suffered a brief episode of the disease in 1765, but a longer episode began in 1788. Though ill during the summer of 1788, George was sufficiently sane to <a href="/wiki/Prorogation.html" title="Prorogation">prorogue</a> Parliament from <a href="/wiki/September_25.html" title="September 25">25 September</a> to <a href="/wiki/November_20.html" title="November 20">20 November</a>. During the intervening time, however, he became seriously deranged and posed a threat to his own life. When Parliament reconvened in November, the King could not, as was customary, communicate to them the agenda for the upcoming legislative session. According to long-established practice, Parliament could not begin the transaction of business until the King had made the <a href="/wiki/Speech_from_the_Throne.html" title="Speech from the Throne">Speech from the Throne</a>. Parliament, however, ignored the custom and began to debate provisions for a regency.</p>
<p>Charles James Fox and William Pitt wrangled over which individual was entitled to take over government during the illness of the Sovereign. Although both parties agreed that it would be most reasonable for George III's eldest son and heir-apparent, the Prince of Wales, to act as Regent, they disagreed over the basis of a regency. Fox suggested that it was the Prince of Wales's absolute right to act on his ill father's behalf; Pitt argued that it was for Parliament to nominate a Regent.</p>
<p>Proceedings were further delayed as the authority for Parliament to merely meet was questioned, as the session had not been formally opened by the Sovereign. Pitt proposed a remedy based on an obscure <a href="/wiki/Legal_fiction.html" title="Legal fiction">legal fiction</a>. As was well-established at the time, the Sovereign could delegate many of his functions to Lords Commissioners by <a href="/wiki/Letters_patent.html" title="Letters patent">letters patent</a>, which were validated by the attachment of the <a href="/wiki/Great_Seal_of_the_Realm.html" title="Great Seal of the Realm">Great Seal</a>. It was proposed that the custodian of the Great Seal, the <a href="/wiki/Lord_Chancellor.html" title="Lord Chancellor">Lord Chancellor</a>, affix the Seal without the consent of the Sovereign. Although such an action would be unlawful, it would not be possible to question the validity of the letters patent, as the presence of the Great Seal would be deemed conclusive in court. George III's second son, the <a href="/wiki/Prince_Frederick%2C_Duke_of_York.html" title="Prince Frederick, Duke of York">Prince Frederick, Duke of York</a>, denounced Pitt's proposal as "unconstitutional and illegal". Nonetheless, the Lords Commissioners were appointed and then opened Parliament. In February 1789, the Regency Bill, authorising the Prince of Wales to act as Prince Regent, was introduced and passed in the House of Commons. But before the House of Lords could pass the bill, George III recovered from his illness under the care of <a href="/wiki/Francis_Willis.html" title="Francis Willis">Dr. Francis Willis</a>. He confirmed the actions of the Lords Commissioners as valid, but resumed full control of government.</p>

<h2>Napoleonic Wars</h2>
<p>After George recovered from his illness, his popularity greatly increased. The <a href="/wiki/French_Revolution.html" title="French Revolution">French Revolution</a>, in which the <a href="/wiki/French_monarchy.html" title="French monarchy">French monarchy</a> had been overthrown, worried many British landowners. France subsequently declared war on Great Britain in 1793, and George soon represented the British resistance. George allowed Pitt to increase taxes, raise armies, and suspend the privilege of the writ of <i><a href="/wiki/Habeas_corpus.html" title="Habeas corpus">habeas corpus</a></i> in the war attempt.</p>
<p>As well-prepared as Great Britain may have been, France was stronger. The <a href="/wiki/First_coalition.html" title="First coalition">First Coalition</a> (which included <a href="/wiki/Austria.html" title="Austria">Austria</a>, <a href="/wiki/Prussia.html" title="Prussia">Prussia</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Spain.html" title="Spain">Spain</a>) was defeated in 1798. The <a href="/wiki/Second_Coalition.html" title="Second Coalition">Second Coalition</a> (which included Austria, <a href="/wiki/Russia.html" title="Russia">Russia</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/Ottoman_Empire.html" title="Ottoman Empire">Ottoman Empire</a>) was defeated in 1800. Only Great Britain was left fighting <a href="/wiki/Napoleon_I_of_France.html" title="Napoleon I of France">Napoleon Bonaparte</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Military_dictator.html" title="Military dictator">military dictator</a> of France. Perhaps surpisingly, a failed <a href="/wiki/Assassination.html" title="Assassination">assassination</a> attempt of <a href="/wiki/May_15.html" title="May 15">May 15</a>, <a href="/wiki/1800.html" title="1800">1800</a> was not political in origin but motivated by the <a href="/wiki/Religion.html" title="Religion">religious</a> <a href="/wiki/Delusion.html" title="Delusion">delusions</a> of his assailant, <a href="/wiki/James_Hadfield.html" title="James Hadfield">James Hadfield</a>, who shot at the King in the <a href="/wiki/Theatre_Royal%2C_Drury_Lane.html" title="Theatre Royal, Drury Lane">Drury Lane Theatre</a> during the playing of the <a href="/wiki/National_anthem.html" title="National anthem">national anthem</a>.</p>
<p>Soon after 1800, a brief lull in hostilities allowed Pitt to concentrate on <a href="/wiki/Ireland.html" title="Ireland">Ireland</a>, where there had been an uprising in 1798. Parliament then passed the <a href="/wiki/Act_of_Union_1800.html" title="Act of Union 1800">Act of Union 1800</a>, which, on <a href="/wiki/January_1.html" title="January 1">1 January</a> <a href="/wiki/1801.html" title="1801">1801</a>, united Great Britain and Ireland into a single nation, known as the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. George used the opportunity to drop <a href="/wiki/English_claims_to_the_French_throne.html" title="English claims to the French throne">the claim to the Throne of France</a>, which English and British Sovereigns had maintained since the reign of <a href="/wiki/Edward_III_of_England.html" title="Edward III of England">Edward III</a>. It is sometimes suggested that George dropped the claim pursuant to the <a href="/wiki/Treaty_of_Paris.html" title="Treaty of Paris">Treaty of Paris (1783)</a> or the <a href="/wiki/Treaty_of_Amiens.html" title="Treaty of Amiens">Treaty of Amiens</a>. Chronologically, neither would be logical; the Treaty of Paris was signed in 1783, and the Treaty of Amiens in 1802 (after George actually dropped his claim to the Throne of France.) It was suggested that George adopt the title "<a href="/wiki/Emperor_of_the_British_and_Hanoverian_Dominions.html" title="Emperor of the British and Hanoverian Dominions">Emperor of the British and Hanoverian Dominions</a>," but he refused. (<a  class="new" title="A. G. Stapleton">A. G. Stapleton</a> writes that George III "felt that his true dignity consisted in his being known to Europe and the world by the appropriated and undisputed style belonging to the British Crown.")</p>
<p>Pitt unpopularly planned to remove certain legal disabilities that applied to <a href="/wiki/Roman_Catholicism.html" title="Roman Catholicism">Roman Catholics</a> after the Union. George III claimed that to emancipate Catholics would be to violate his coronation oath, in which Sovereigns promise to maintain Protestantism. The King famously declared, "Where is the power on Earth to absolve me from the observance of every sentence of that oath, particularly the one requiring me to maintain the Protestant Reformed Religion? … No, no, I had rather beg my bread from door to door throughout Europe, than consent to any such measure. I can give up my crown and retire from power. I can quit my palace and live in a cottage. I can lay my head on a block and lose my life, but I cannot break my oath."</p>
<p>Faced with opposition to his religious reform policies, Pitt threatened to resign. At about the same time, the King suffered an attack of insanity, but quickly recovered. On <a href="/wiki/March_14.html" title="March 14">14 March</a> 1801, Pitt was formally replaced by the <a href="/wiki/Speaker_of_the_British_House_of_Commons.html" title="Speaker of the British House of Commons">Speaker of the House of Commons</a>, <a href="/wiki/Henry_Addington%2C_1st_Viscount_Sidmouth.html" title="Henry Addington, 1st Viscount Sidmouth">Henry Addington, 1st Viscount Sidmouth</a>. As Addington was his close friend, Pitt remained as a private advisor. Addington's ministry was particularly unremarkable, as almost no reforms were made or measures passed. In fact, the nation was strongly against the very idea of reform, having just witnessed the bloody French Revolution. Although they called for passive behaviour in the United Kingdom, the public wanted strong action in Europe, but Addington failed to deliver. In October 1801, he made peace with the French, and in 1802 signed the Treaty of Amiens.</p>
<p>George did not consider the peace with France as "real"; it was more of an experiment. In 1803, the two nations once again declared war on each other. In 1804, George was again affected by his porphyria; as soon as he was able to continue his rule, he discovered that Addington was displeasing the public, which did not trust him to lead the nation into war. Instead, the public tended to put more faith in William Pitt the Younger. Pitt sought to appoint <a href="/wiki/Charles_James_Fox.html" title="Charles James Fox">Charles James Fox</a> to his ministry, but George III refused. The King disliked Fox, who had encouraged the Prince of Wales to lead an extravagant and expensive life. <a href="/wiki/William_Wyndham_Grenville%2C_1st_Baron_Grenville.html" title="William Wyndham Grenville, 1st Baron Grenville">William Wyndham Grenville, 1st Baron Grenville</a> perceived an injustice to Fox, and refused to join the new ministry.</p>
<p>Pitt concentrated on forming a coalition with Austria, Russia, and <a href="/wiki/Sweden.html" title="Sweden">Sweden</a>. The <a href="/wiki/Third_Coalition.html" title="Third Coalition">Third Coalition</a>, however, met the same fate as the First and Second Coalitions, collapsing in 1805.

<p>The setbacks in Europe took a toll on William Pitt's health. Pitt died in 1806, once again reopening the question of who should serve in the ministry. Lord Grenville became Prime Minister, and his "Ministry of All the Talents" included Charles James Fox. The King was extremely distressed that he was forced to capitulate over the appointment. After Fox's death in September 1806, the King and ministry were in open conflict. The ministry had proposed a measure whereby Roman Catholics would be allowed to serve in the Armed Forces. George not only instructed them to drop the measure, but also to make an agreement to never set up such a measure again. The ministers agreed to drop the measure then pending, but refused to bind themselves in the future. In 1807, they were dismissed and replaced by the Duke of Portland as the nominal Prime Minister, with actual power being held by the <a href="/wiki/Chancellor_of_the_Exchequer.html" title="Chancellor of the Exchequer">Chancellor of the Exchequer</a> <a href="/wiki/Spencer_Perceval.html" title="Spencer Perceval">Spencer Perceval</a>. Parliament was dissolved; the subsequent election gave the ministry a strong majority in the <a href="/wiki/British_House_of_Commons.html" title="British House of Commons">House of Commons</a>. George III made no further major political decisions during his reign; the replacement of the Duke of Portland by Perceval was of little actual significance.</p>

Prince George, Prince of Wales, acted as Prince-Regent from 1811 to 1820.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>In 1810, George III became dangerously ill, the malady possibly having been triggered by the death of his youngest and favourite daughter, <a href="/wiki/Princess_Amelia_of_the_United_Kingdom.html" title="Princess Amelia of the United Kingdom">Princess Amelia</a>, from <a href="/wiki/Erysipelas.html" title="Erysipelas">erysipelas</a> or <a href="/wiki/Porphyria.html" title="Porphyria">porphyria</a>. Arsenic poisoning is also a possible cause. By 1811, George III had become permanently insane and was locked away at Windsor Castle until his death. Sometimes speaking for many hours without pause, he claimed to talk to <a href="/wiki/Angel.html" title="Angel">angels</a>. One day, on a drive through Windsor Great Park, the king threw his arms up into the air and shouted, "Stop!" He alighted, walked over to an oak tree and shook hands with one of its branches. He spoke for several moments before a footman asked him if he was feeling well. The King replied, "Of course I am! Now don't interrupt me sir. I am talking to the king of Prussia." (King <a href="/wiki/Frederick_William_III_of_Prussia.html" title="Frederick William III of Prussia">Frederick William III of Prussia</a>). To treat his illness, his doctors gave him <a  class="new" title="James's Powder">James's Powder</a> (<a href="/wiki/Calomel.html" title="Calomel">calomel</a> and <a  class="new" title="Tartar emetic">tartar emetic</a>) and bled him regularly. They also advised him to bathe in the sea (thus encouraging seaside holidays).</p>
<p>Parliament then passed the <a href="/wiki/Regency_Act_1811.html" title="Regency Act 1811">Regency Act 1811</a>, to which the <a href="/wiki/Royal_Assent.html" title="Royal Assent">Royal Assent</a> was granted by the Lords Commissioners, appointed under the same irregular procedure as was adopted in 1788. The Prince of Wales acted as Regent for the remainder of George III's life.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Spencer_Perceval.html" title="Spencer Perceval">Spencer Perceval</a> was <a href="/wiki/Assassination.html" title="Assassination">assassinated</a> in 1812 (the only British Prime Minister to have suffered such a fate) and was replaced by <a href="/wiki/Robert_Banks_Jenkinson%2C_2nd_Earl_of_Liverpool.html" title="Robert Banks Jenkinson, 2nd Earl of Liverpool">Robert Banks Jenkinson, 2nd Earl of Liverpool</a>. Lord Liverpool oversaw British victory in the Napoleonic Wars. The subsequent <a href="/wiki/Congress_of_Vienna.html" title="Congress of Vienna">Congress of Vienna</a> led to significant territorial gains for Hanover, which was upgraded from an electorate to a kingdom.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, George's health deteriorated. Over the <a href="/wiki/Christmas.html" title="Christmas">Christmas</a> of 1819, he suffered a further bout of madness and spoke nonsense for 58 hours, then sank into a <a href="/wiki/Coma.html" title="Coma">coma</a>. On <a href="/wiki/January_29.html" title="January 29">29 January</a> <a href="/wiki/1820.html" title="1820">1820</a>, he died, blind, deaf and insane, at <a href="/wiki/Windsor_Castle.html" title="Windsor Castle">Windsor Castle</a>. George lived for 81 years and 239 days and reigned for 59 years and 96 days — in each case, more than any other English or British monarch until that point. This record has been surpassed only once, by George's granddaughter <a href="/wiki/Victoria_of_the_United_Kingdom.html" title="Victoria of the United Kingdom">Queen Victoria</a>. George III's reign was longer than the reigns of all three of his immediate predecessors (<a href="/wiki/Anne_of_Great_Britain.html" title="Anne of Great Britain">Queen Anne</a>, <a href="/wiki/George_I_of_Great_Britain.html" title="George I of Great Britain">King George I</a> and <a href="/wiki/George_II_of_Great_Britain.html" title="George II of Great Britain">King George II</a>) combined. George III was buried on <a href="/wiki/February_16.html" title="February 16">16 February</a> in <a href="/wiki/St._George%27s_Chapel%2C_Windsor.html" title="St. George's Chapel, Windsor">St. George's Chapel, Windsor</a>.

<p>George was followed by his eldest son <a href="/wiki/George_IV_of_the_United_Kingdom.html" title="George IV of the United Kingdom">George IV</a>. Next came another of George III's sons, who became <a href="/wiki/William_IV_of_the_United_Kingdom.html" title="William IV of the United Kingdom">William IV</a>. William IV, too, died without legitimate children, leaving the throne to his niece, Victoria, the last monarch of the House of Hanover.</p>

<h2>Legacy</h2>
<p>While tremendously popular in Britain, George was hated by the rebellious American colonists. The <a href="/wiki/United_States_Declaration_of_Independence.html" title="United States Declaration of Independence">United States Declaration of Independence</a> held him personally responsible for the political problems faced by the United States. The Declaration does not blame either Parliament or the ministers, and exposure to the views expressed in the Declaration has led the American public to perceive George as a tyrant. This view is, at worst, a historical consequence of the political climate of the times, wherein the state of the King's governing powers and mental health were practically unknown by the general public, and even less so by the distant North American colonies ruled under his crown. Another factor that exacerbated American resentment was the King's failure to intercede personally on the colonists' behalf after the <a href="/wiki/Olive_Branch_Petition.html" title="Olive Branch Petition">Olive Branch Petition</a>. Many modern British historians also place primary blame for the loss of the colonies on George, largely because they attribute the <a href="/wiki/Proclamation_of_Rebellion.html" title="Proclamation of Rebellion">Proclamation of Rebellion</a> (which treated the colonies' complaints as acts of rebellion) to him personally.</p>
<p>George was hated in Ireland for the atrocities carried out in his name during the suppression of the <a href="/wiki/Irish_Rebellion_of_1798.html" title="Irish Rebellion of 1798">1798 rebellion</a>.</p>
<p>George's insanity is the subject of the film <i><a href="/wiki/The_Madness_of_King_George.html" title="The Madness of King George">The Madness of King George</a></i> (1994), based on the play <i>The Madness of George III</i> by <a href="/wiki/Alan_Bennett.html" title="Alan Bennett">Alan Bennett</a>. The film concerns George's first bouts of insanity. He was portrayed by <a href="/wiki/Nigel_Hawthorne.html" title="Nigel Hawthorne">Nigel Hawthorne</a>, who received the <a href="/wiki/Laurence_Olivier_Awards.html" title="Laurence Olivier Awards">Laurence Olivier Award</a> and was nominated for an <a href="/wiki/Academy_Awards.html" title="Academy Awards">Academy Award</a> for his role.</p>
<p>George may have suffered from a disease now known as <a href="/wiki/Porphyria.html" title="Porphyria">porphyria</a>. It had struck at various times, and made him appear to be mentally ill, also making him incapable of logical acts. This may be part of why he was thought to be insane.</p>
<p>There are cities and towns in former British colonies which are named Georgetown. Some of these may be named after George III and some after his son <a href="/wiki/George_IV_of_the_United_Kingdom.html" title="George IV of the United Kingdom">George IV</a>. Statues of George III can be seen today in (amongst other locations) the courtyard of Somerset House in London, and in Weymouth, Dorset, which he popularised as a seaside resort (one of the first in England). A statue of George III was pulled down in New York at the beginning of the War of Independence in 1776 and two engravings of its destruction still exist (though one is wholly inaccurate).</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/British_Agricultural_Revolution.html" title="British Agricultural Revolution">British Agricultural Revolution</a> reached its peak under George III, providing for an expanded population and freeing up much of the workforce to drive the <a href="/wiki/Industrial_Revolution.html" title="Industrial Revolution">Industrial Revolution</a>, which also began under George III.</p>
<p>He is also remembered, to a lesser extent, for his tendency to repeat himself and to say "What? What?" at the end of almost every sentence.</p>

<p>Whilst he was King of Great Britain, George's <a href="/wiki/Heraldry.html" title="Heraldry">arms</a> were: <i>Quarterly, I Gules three lions passant guardant in pale Or (for <a href="/wiki/England.html" title="England">England</a>) impaling Or a lion rampant within a double-tressure flory-counter-flory Gules (for <a href="/wiki/Scotland.html" title="Scotland">Scotland</a>); II Azure three fleurs-de-lys Or (for <a href="/wiki/France.html" title="France">France</a>); III Azure a harp Or stringed Argent (for <a href="/wiki/Ireland.html" title="Ireland">Ireland</a>); IV tierced per pale and per chevron (for <a href="/wiki/Hanover.html" title="Hanover">Hanover</a>), I Gules two lions passant guardant Or (for <a href="/wiki/Brunswick_%28city%29.html" title="Brunswick (city)">Brunswick</a>), II Or a semy of hearts Gules a lion rampant Azure (for <a href="/wiki/L%C3%BCneburg.html" title="Lüneburg">Lüneburg</a>), III Gules a horse courant Argent (for <a href="/wiki/Westfalen.html" title="Westfalen">Westfalen</a>), overall an escutcheon Gules charged with the crown of <a href="/wiki/Charlemagne.html" title="Charlemagne">Charlemagne</a> Or (for the dignity of Arch<a href="/wiki/Treasurer.html" title="Treasurer">treasurer</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Holy_Roman_Empire.html" title="Holy Roman Empire">Holy Roman Empire</a>)</i>.</p>
<p>When he became King of the United Kingdom, his arms were amended, dropping the French quartering.
