<h2>Background</h2>
<p>In the early 1980s, it appeared that conventional <a href="/wiki/Central_processing_unit.html" title="Central processing unit">CPUs</a> were reaching their performance limits. Up to this point in time, designers had been limited primarily by the amount of circuitry they could place on a chip due to manufacturing issues. But as the "fabbing" process continued to improve, soon the problem became that the chips could hold more circuitry than the designers knew how to use. Soon the traditional <a href="/wiki/CISC.html" title="CISC">CISC</a> designs were reaching a performance plateau, and it wasn't clear it could be surpassed.</p>
<p>It seemed that the only way forward was to increase the use of parallelism, the use of several CPUs that would work together to solve several tasks at the same time. This depended on the machines in question being able to run several tasks at once, a process known as <a href="/wiki/Computer_multitasking.html" title="Computer multitasking">multitasking</a>. Multitasking had generally been too difficult for previous CPU designs to handle, but more recent designs were able to run it effectively. It was clear that in the future this would be a feature of all <a href="/wiki/Operating_system.html" title="Operating system">operating systems</a>.</p>
<p>A side effect of most multitasking design is that it often also allows the processes to be run on physically different CPUs, in which case it is known as <a href="/wiki/Multiprocessing.html" title="Multiprocessing">multiprocessing</a>. A low-cost CPU built with multiprocessing in mind could allow the speed of a machine to be increased by adding additional CPUs, potentially for far less money than adding a single faster CPU design.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Design">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Design" id="Design"></a></p>
<h2>Design</h2>
<p>The transputer (<i>trans</i>istor com<i>puter</i>) was the first general purpose microprocessor designed specifically to be used in parallel computing systems. The goal was to produce a family of chips ranging in power and cost that would then be wired together to form a complete computer. The name was selected to indicate the role the individual transputers would play: numbers of them would be used as basic building blocks, just as transistors had earlier.</p>
<p>Originally the plan was to make the transputer cost only a few dollars per unit. INMOS saw them being used for practically everything, from operating as the main CPU for a computer, to acting as a <a href="/wiki/Channel_controller.html" title="Channel controller">channel controller</a> for disk drives in the same machine. Spare cycles on any of these transputers could be used for other tasks, greatly increasing the overall performance of the machines.</p>
<p>Even a single transputer would have all the circuitry needed to work by itself, a feature more commonly associated with <a href="/wiki/Microcontroller.html" title="Microcontroller">microcontrollers</a>. The idea in this case was to allow the transputers to be connected together as easily as possible, without the requirement for a complex bus (or motherboard). Instead you simply supplied power and a simple clock signal. You did not have to provide <a href="/wiki/Random_Access_Memory.html" title="Random Access Memory">RAM</a>, a RAM controller, bus support or even an <a href="/wiki/RTOS.html" title="RTOS">RTOS</a> – these were all built in.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Links">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Links" id="Links"></a></p>
<h3>Links</h3>
<p>The basic design of the transputer included serial links that allowed it to communicate with up to four other transputers, each at 5, 10 or 20 Mbit/s – which was very fast for the 1980s. Any number of transputers could be connected together over even longish links (tens of meters) to form a single computing "farm". A hypothetical desktop machine might have two of the "low end" transputers handling <a href="/wiki/Input/output.html" title="Input/output">I/O</a> tasks on some of their serial lines (hooked up to appropriate hardware) while they talked to one of their larger cousins acting as a <a href="/wiki/Central_processing_unit.html" title="Central processing unit">CPU</a> on another.</p>
<p>There were limits to the size of a system that could be built in this fashion. Since each transputer was linked to another transputer in a fixed point-to-point layout, sending messages to a more distant transputer required the messages to be forwarded off by each chip on the line. This introduced a delay with every "hop" over a link, leading to long delays on large nets. To solve this problem INMOS also provided a zero-delay switch that connected up to 32 transputers (or switches) into even larger networks.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Booting">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Booting" id="Booting"></a></p>
<h3>Booting</h3>
<p>Transputers could be booted over the network links (as opposed to the memory as in most machines) so a single transputer could start up the entire network. There was a pin called BootFromROM that when asserted caused the transputer to start two bytes from the top of memory (sufficient for up to a 256 byte backward jump, usually out of ROM). When this pin was de-asserted, the first byte that arrived down any link was the length of a bootstrap to be downloaded, which was placed in low memory and run. The 'special' lengths of 0 and 1 were reserved for 'peek' and 'poke' - allowing inspection and changing of RAM in an unbooted transputer. After a peek (which required an address) or a poke (which took a word address, and a word of data - 16 or 32 bit depending on the basic word width of the transputer variant) the transputer would return to waiting for a bootstrap.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Scheduler">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Scheduler" id="Scheduler"></a></p>
<h3>Scheduler</h3>
<p>Supporting the links was additional circuitry that handled scheduling of the traffic over them. Processes waiting on communications would automatically pause while the networking circuitry finished its reads or writes. Other processes running on the transputer would then be given that processing time. It included two <a href="/wiki/Priority_level.html" title="Priority level">priority levels</a> to improve <a href="/wiki/Real-time.html" title="Real-time">real-time</a> and <a href="/wiki/Multiprocessor.html" title="Multiprocessor">multiprocessor</a> operation. The same logical system was used to communicate between programs running on a single transputer, implemented as "virtual network links" in memory. So programs asking for any input or output automatically paused while the operation completed, a task that normally required the operating system to handle as the arbiter of hardware. Operating systems on the transputer did not have to handle scheduling, in fact, one could consider the chip itself to have an OS inside it.</p>
<p>In order to include all this functionality on a single chip, the transputer's core logic was simpler than most CPUs. It used a <a href="/wiki/RISC.html" title="RISC">RISC</a>-based design, but unlike the more common register-heavy load-store RISC CPUs, the transputer had only three data registers, which behaved as a stack. In addition a Workspace pointer pointed to a working area of memory, easily accessible via the Load Local and Store Local instructions. This allowed for very fast <a href="/wiki/Context_switch.html" title="Context switch">context switching</a> by simply changing the workspace pointer to the memory used by another process (a technique used in a number of contemporary designs). The three register stack contents were not preserved past certain instructions, like Jump, when the transputer could do a context switch.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Instruction set">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Instruction_set" id="Instruction_set"></a></p>
<h3>Instruction set</h3>
<p>The transputer instruction set comprised 8-bit instructions broken into two <a href="/wiki/Nibble.html" title="Nibble">nibbles</a>. The "upper" nibble contained the instruction code, making it truly RISC with only 16 basic instructions. The "lower" nibble contained data, either as a constant or, more commonly, as an offset into the stack pointer. Larger constants and offsets could be used, but they required additional bytes of address to be fetched and decoded. Additional less frequently needed instructions were supported via the <i>Operate</i> (Opr) instruction code, which decoded the data constant as an extended opcode, providing for almost endless and easy instruction set expansion as newer implementations of the transputer were introduced. Processes with smaller contexts thus ran faster, but the whole idea of the transputer was to run many small processes anyway.</p>
<p>The first 16 'primary' instructions were&#160;:-</p>

<h3>TRAMs</h3>
<p>In order to provide an easy means of prototyping, constructing and configuring multiple-transputer systems, INMOS introduced the <i>TRAM</i> (TRAnsputer Module) standard in 1987. A TRAM was essentially a "building block" <a href="/wiki/Daughterboard.html" title="Daughterboard">daughterboard</a> comprising a transputer and, optionally, external memory and/or peripheral devices, with simple standardised connectors providing power, transputer links, clock and system signals. Various sizes of TRAM were defined, from the basic Size 1 TRAM (3.66 in by 1.05 in) up to Size 8 (3.66 in by 8.75 in). INMOS produced a range of TRAM <a href="/wiki/Motherboards.html" title="Motherboards">motherboards</a> for various host buses such as <a href="/wiki/Industry_standard_architecture.html" title="Industry standard architecture">ISA</a>, <a href="/wiki/MicroChannel.html" title="MicroChannel">MicroChannel</a> or <a href="/wiki/VMEbus.html" title="VMEbus">VMEbus</a>.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Software">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Software" id="Software"></a></p>
<h2>Software</h2>
<p>Transputers were intended to be programmed using the <a href="/wiki/Occam_programming_language.html" title="Occam programming language">occam programming language</a>, based on the <a href="/wiki/Communicating_Sequential_Processes.html" title="Communicating Sequential Processes">CSP</a> <a href="/wiki/Process_calculus.html" title="Process calculus">process calculus</a>. In fact it is fair to say that the transputer was built specifically to run occam, even more so than contemporary <a href="/wiki/CISC.html" title="CISC">CISC</a> designs were built to run languages like <a href="/wiki/Pascal_programming_language.html" title="Pascal programming language">Pascal</a> or <a href="/wiki/C_programming_language.html" title="C programming language">C</a>. Occam supported <a href="/wiki/Concurrency_%28computer_science%29.html" title="Concurrency (computer science)">concurrency</a> and channel-based inter-process or inter-processor communication as a fundamental part of the language. With the parallelism and communications built into the chip and the language interacting with it directly, writing code for things like device controllers became a triviality – even the most basic code could watch the serial ports for I/O, and would automatically sleep when there was no data.</p>
<p>The initial occam development environment for the transputer was the INMOS D700 <i>Transputer Development System</i> (TDS). This was an unorthodox integrated development environment incorporating an editor, compiler, linker and (post-mortem) debugger. The TDS was itself a transputer application written in occam. The TDS text editor was notable in that it was a <a href="/wiki/Folding_editor.html" title="Folding editor">folding editor</a>, allowing blocks of code to be hidden and revealed, to make the structure of the code more apparent. Unfortunately, the combination of an unfamiliar programming language and equally unfamiliar development environment did nothing for the early popularity of the transputer. Later, INMOS would release more conventional occam cross-compilers, the <i>occam 2 Toolsets</i>.</p>
<p>Implementations of more mainstream programming languages, such as C, <a href="/wiki/FORTRAN.html" title="FORTRAN">FORTRAN</a> and Pascal were also later released by both INMOS and third-party vendors. These usually included language extensions or libraries providing, in a less elegant way, occam-like concurrency and channel-based communication.</p>
<p>The transputer's lack of support for virtual memory inhibited the porting of mainstream variants of the <a href="/wiki/Unix.html" title="Unix">UNIX</a> operating system, though ports of <a href="/wiki/UNIX-like.html" title="UNIX-like">UNIX-like</a> operating systems (such as <a href="/wiki/Minix.html" title="Minix">Minix</a> and <a href="/wiki/Idris_%28operating_system%29.html" title="Idris (operating system)">Idris</a> from <a href="/wiki/Whitesmiths.html" title="Whitesmiths">Whitesmiths</a>) were produced. An advanced UNIX-like <a href="/wiki/Distributed_operating_system.html" title="Distributed operating system">distributed operating system</a>, <a href="/wiki/HeliOS.html" title="HeliOS">HeliOS</a>, was also designed specifically for multi-transputer systems by <a href="/wiki/Perihelion_Software.html" title="Perihelion Software">Perihelion Software</a>.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Implementations">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Implementations" id="Implementations"></a></p>
<h2>Implementations</h2>
<p>The first transputers were announced in <a href="/wiki/1983.html" title="1983">1983</a> and released in <a href="/wiki/1984.html" title="1984">1984</a>.</p>
<p>In keeping with their role as <a href="/wiki/Microcontroller.html" title="Microcontroller">microcontroller</a>-like devices, they included on-board <a href="/wiki/RAM.html" title="RAM">RAM</a> and a built-in RAM controller which allowed you to add more memory without any additional hardware. Unlike other designs, the transputers did not include I/O lines, this was to be added with hardware attached to the existing serial links. There was one 'Event' line, similar to a conventional processors interrupt line. Treated as a channel, a program could 'input' from the event channel, and proceed only after the event line was asserted.</p>
<p>All transputers ran from an external 5 MHz clock input; this was multiplied to provide the processor clock.</p>
<p>The transputer did not include an <a href="/wiki/Memory_management_unit.html" title="Memory management unit">MMU</a> or a <a href="/wiki/Virtual_memory.html" title="Virtual memory">virtual memory</a> system.</p>
<p>Transputer variants (excepting the cancelled T9000) can be categorised into three groups: the <a href="/wiki/16-bit.html" title="16-bit">16-bit</a> <b>T2</b> series, the <a href="/wiki/32-bit.html" title="32-bit">32-bit</a> <b>T4</b> series and the 32-bit <b>T8</b> series with 64-bit <a href="/wiki/IEEE_754.html" title="IEEE 754">IEEE 754</a> <a href="/wiki/Floating-point.html" title="Floating-point">floating-point</a> support.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: 16-bit">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="16-bit"></a></p>
<h3>16-bit</h3>
<p>The prototype 16-bit transputer was the <b>S43</b>, which lacked the scheduler and DMA-controlled block transfer on the links. At launch, the <b>T212</b> and <b>M212</b> (the latter with an on-board disk controller) were the 16-bit offerings. The T212 was available in 17.5 and 20 MHz processor clock speed ratings. The T212 was superseded by the <b>T222</b>, with on-chip RAM expanded from 2 kB to 4kB, and, later, the <b>T225</b>. This added debugging <a href="/wiki/Breakpoint.html" title="Breakpoint">breakpoint</a> support (by extending the instruction <tt>J 0</tt>) plus some extra instructions from the T800 instruction set. Both the T222 and T225 ran at 20 MHz.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: 32-bit">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="32-bit"></a></p>
<h3>32-bit</h3>
<p>At launch, the <b>T414</b> was the 32-bit offering. Originally, the first 32-bit variant was to be the <b>T424</b>, but fabrication difficulties meant that this was redesigned as the T414 with 2 kB on-board RAM instead of the intended 4 kB. The T414 was available in 15 and 20 MHz varieties. The RAM was later reinstated to 4 kB on the <b>T425</b> (in 20, 25 and 30 MHz varieties), which also added the <tt>J 0</tt> breakpoint support and extra T800 instructions. The <b>T400</b>, released in September <a href="/wiki/1989.html" title="1989">1989</a>, was a low-cost 20MHz T425 derivative with 2 kB and two instead of four links, intended for the <a href="/wiki/Embedded_systems.html" title="Embedded systems">embedded systems</a> market.</p>

<h3>Floating point</h3>
<p>The second-generation <b>T800</b> transputer, introduced in <a href="/wiki/1987.html" title="1987">1987</a>, included a 64-bit floating point unit and three additional registers for floating point use, in addition to an extended instruction set. It also had 4 kB of on-board RAM and was available in 20 or 25 MHz versions. Breakpoint support was added in the later <b>T801</b> and <b>T805</b>, the former featuring separate address and data buses to improve performance. The T805 was also later available as a 30 MHz part.</p>
<p>An enhanced <b>T810</b> was planned, which would have had more RAM, more, faster links, extra instructions and improved microcode, but this was cancelled around <a href="/wiki/1990.html" title="1990">1990</a>.</p>
<p>INMOS also produced a variety of support chips for the transputer processors, such as the <b>C004</b> 32-way link switch and the <b>C012</b> "link adapter" which allowed transputer links to be interfaced to an 8-bit data bus.</p>

<h2>Markets</h2>
<p>While the transputer was simple but powerful compared to many contemporary designs, it never came close to meeting its goal of being used universally as both CPU and microcontroller roles. In the microcontroller realm, the market was dominated by 8-bit machines where cost was the only serious consideration. Here, even the T2s were too powerful and expensive for most users.</p>
<p>In the <a href="/wiki/Computer_desktop.html" title="Computer desktop">computer desktop</a>/<a href="/wiki/Workstation.html" title="Workstation">workstation</a> world, the transputer was fairly fast (operating at about 10 <a href="/wiki/Million_instructions_per_second.html" title="Million instructions per second">MIPS</a> at 20MHz). This was excellent performance for the early 1980s, but by the time the FPU-equipped T800 was shipping, other RISC designs had surpassed it. This could have been mitigated to a large extent if machines used multiple transputers as planned, but the T800 cost about $400 each when introduced for a poor price/performance ratio. Few transputer-based workstation systems were designed; the most notable probably being the <a href="/wiki/Atari_Transputer_Workstation.html" title="Atari Transputer Workstation">Atari Transputer Workstation</a>.</p>
<p>The transputer was more successful in the field of <a href="/wiki/Massively_parallel.html" title="Massively parallel">massively parallel</a> computing, where several vendors produced transputer-based systems in the late <a href="/wiki/1980s.html" title="1980s">1980s</a>. These included <a href="/wiki/Meiko.html" title="Meiko">Meiko</a> (founded by ex-INMOS employees), <a href="/wiki/Floating_Point_Systems.html" title="Floating Point Systems">Floating Point Systems</a>, <a  class="new" title="Parsytec">Parsytec</a> and <a  class="new" title="Parsys">Parsys</a>.</p>

<h2>T9000</h2>
<p>INMOS attempted to improve on the performance of the T8 series transputers with the introduction of the <b>T9000</b> (code-named <b>H1</b> during development). The T9000 shared most features with the T800, but moved several pieces of the design into hardware, and added several features for <a href="/wiki/Superscalar.html" title="Superscalar">superscalar</a> support. Unlike the earlier models, the T9000 had a true 16 kB high speed <a href="/wiki/CPU_cache.html" title="CPU cache">cache</a> instead of RAM, but also allowed it to be used as memory and included MMU-like functionality to handle all of this (known as the <i>PMI</i>). For additional speed the T9000 cached the top 32 locations on the stack, instead of three as in earlier versions.</p>
<p>The T9000 used a five stage pipeline for added speed. An interesting addition was the <i>grouper</i> which would collect instructions out of the cache and group them into larger packages of 4 bytes to feed the pipeline faster. Groups then completed in a single cycle, as if they were single larger instructions working on a faster CPU.</p>
<p>The link system was upgraded to a new 100 MHz mode, but unlike the previous systems the links were no longer downwardly compatible. This new packet-based link protocol was called <i>DS-Link</i> and later formed the basis of the <a href="/wiki/IEEE_1355.html" title="IEEE 1355">IEEE 1355</a> serial interconnect standard. The T9000 also added link routing hardware called the <i>VCP</i> (Virtual Channel Processor) which changed the links from point-to-point to a true network, allowing for the creation of any number of <i>virtual channels</i> on the links. This meant programs no longer had to be aware of the physical layout of the connections. A range of DS-Link support chips were also developed, including the <b>C104</b> 32-way crossbar switch, and the <b>C101</b> link adapter.</p>
<p>Long delays in the T9000's development meant that the faster load-store designs were already outperforming it by the time it was to be released. In fact it consistently failed to reach its own performance goal of beating the T800 by ten times, when the project was finally cancelled it was still only about 36 MIPS at 50 MHz. The production delays gave rise to the quip that the best host architecture for a T9000 was an overhead projector.</p>
<p>This was too much for INMOS, who didn't have the funding needed to continue development. By this time, the company had been sold to SGS-Thomson (now <a href="/wiki/STMicroelectronics.html" title="STMicroelectronics">STMicroelectronics</a>). SGS-Thomson's focus was the embedded systems market, and eventually the T9000 project was abandoned. However, a comprehensively redesigned 32-bit transputer intended for embedded applications, the <b>ST20</b> series, was later produced, utilising some technology developed for the T9000. The ST20 core was incorporated into chipsets for <a href="/wiki/Set-top_box.html" title="Set-top box">set-top box</a> and <a href="/wiki/GPS.html" title="GPS">GPS</a> applications.</p>

<h2>Comparison with modern technology</h2>
<p>Ironically it was largely through additional internal parallelism that conventional CPU designs got faster. Instead of using a heavyweight explicit system like the transputer, modern CPU designs are parallel only at the instruction level, looking at the code being run and then distributing what it can be sure of across a number of internal arithmetic and storage units within the CPU core. It appears this form of parallelism, known as <a href="/wiki/Superscalar.html" title="Superscalar">superscalar</a>, is much more suitable to general purpose computing.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the model of multiple cooperating processors can be found in modern <a href="/wiki/Cluster_computing.html" title="Cluster computing">cluster computing</a> systems and <a href="/wiki/Supercomputer.html" title="Supercomputer">supercomputers</a>. Unlike in the proposed transputer architecture, the processing units in these systems are similar to conventional computer servers, using CPUs with an internal superscalar architecture, access to substantial amounts of memory and often disk storage, and conventional operating systems and network interfaces. The software architecture used to marshal the cooperating software processes across the loosely-coupled processors in these systems is typically far more heavyweight than that proposed in the transputer architecture.</p>
<p>The nearest modern equivalent to the transputer link technology is the <a href="/wiki/HyperTransport.html" title="HyperTransport">HyperTransport</a> processor interconnection fabric designed by <a href="/wiki/AMD.html" title="AMD">AMD</a>. Although it is capable of message-passing, HyperTransport is, unlike the transputer link, generally used to implement a <a href="/wiki/Shared_memory.html" title="Shared memory">shared memory</a> system for implementing a traditional <a href="/wiki/Symmetric_multiprocessing.html" title="Symmetric multiprocessing">symmetric multiprocessing</a> software architecture.</p>
<p>A recent intriguing development is the <a href="/wiki/Cell_processor.html" title="Cell processor">Cell processor</a> architecture designed by Sony, which some of Sony's patent applications seem to show as being designed to be able to run distributed processes at low level in a similar way to that proposed in the transputer architecture. However, this aspect of the Cell design does not seem to have been used in the first implementation of the system, which appears to be more dedicated to using its abilities as a set of parallel DSP engines connected by DMA pipelines, under the control of a conventional core processor.</p>
