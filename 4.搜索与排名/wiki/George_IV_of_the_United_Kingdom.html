The <a href="/wiki/English_Regency.html" title="English Regency">Regency</a>, George's nine-year tenure as Prince Regent, which commenced in 1811 and ended with George III's death in 1820, was marked by victory in the <a href="/wiki/Napoleonic_Wars.html" title="Napoleonic Wars">Napoleonic Wars</a> in Europe.

<p>George is remembered largely for the extravagant lifestyle that he maintained as prince and monarch. It is reported that every time he had intimate relations with a woman he would cut a lock of her hair and place it in an envelope with her name on it. At the time of his death there were allegedly 7,000 such envelopes.

<p>The Prince of Wales turned 21 in 1783, when he obtained a grant of £60,000 from Parliament and an annual income of £50,000 from his father. He then established his residence in <a href="/wiki/Carlton_House.html" title="Carlton House">Carlton House</a>, where he lived a profligate life. Animosity developed between the prince and his father, a monarch who desired more frugal behaviour on the part of the <a href="/wiki/Heir-apparent.html" title="Heir-apparent">heir-apparent</a>. The King, a political conservative, was also alienated by the Prince of Wales's adherence to <a href="/wiki/Charles_James_Fox.html" title="Charles James Fox">Charles James Fox</a> and other radically-inclined politicians.</p>
<p>Soon after he reached the age of 21, the Prince of Wales fell in love with a Roman Catholic, <a href="/wiki/Maria_Anne_Fitzherbert.html" title="Maria Anne Fitzherbert">Maria Anne Fitzherbert</a>. Mrs. Fitzherbert was a widow twice over; her first husband, <a  class="new" title="Edward Weld">Edward Weld</a>, died in 1775, and her second husband, <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Fitzherbert.html" title="Thomas Fitzherbert">Thomas Fitzherbert</a>, in 1781. A marriage between the two was prohibited by the <a href="/wiki/Act_of_Settlement_1701.html" title="Act of Settlement 1701">Act of Settlement 1701</a>, which declared those who married Roman Catholics ineligible to succeed to the Throne. In addition, under the <a href="/wiki/Royal_Marriages_Act_1772.html" title="Royal Marriages Act 1772">Royal Marriages Act 1772</a> the Prince of Wales could not marry without the consent of the King, which would have never been granted. Nevertheless, the couple contracted a "marriage" on <a href="/wiki/December_15.html" title="December 15">15 December</a> <a href="/wiki/1785.html" title="1785">1785</a>. Legally the union was void, as the King's assent was never requested. However, Mrs. Fitzherbert believed that she was the Prince of Wales's <a href="/wiki/Canon_law.html" title="Canon law">canonical</a> and true wife, holding the law of the Church to be superior to the law of the State. For political reasons, the union remained secret and Mrs. Fitzherbert promised not to publish any evidence relating to it.</p>
<p>The Prince of Wales was plunged into debt by his exorbitant lifestyle. His father refused to assist him, forcing him to quit Carlton House and live in Mrs. Fitzherbert's residence. In 1787, the Prince of Wales's allies in the <a href="/wiki/British_House_of_Commons.html" title="British House of Commons">House of Commons</a> introduced a proposal to relieve his debts with a parliamentary grant. The prince's personal relationship with Mrs. Fitzherbert was suspected, but revelation of the illegal marriage would have scandalized the nation and doomed any parliamentary proposal to aid him. Acting on the prince's authority, the <a href="/wiki/British_Whig_Party.html" title="British Whig Party">Whig</a> leader Charles James Fox declared that the story was a calumny. Mrs. Fitzherbert was not pleased with the public denial of the marriage in such vehement terms and contemplated severing her ties to the prince. He appeased her by asking another Whig, <a href="/wiki/Richard_Brinsley_Sheridan.html" title="Richard Brinsley Sheridan">Richard Brinsley Sheridan</a>, to restate Fox's forceful declaration in more careful words. Parliament, meanwhile, was sufficiently pleased to grant the Prince of Wales £161,000 for the payment of his debts, in addition to £20,000 for improvements to Carlton House. The King also agreed to increase the Prince of Wales's annual allowance by £10,000.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Regency Crisis of 1788">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Regency_Crisis_of_1788" id="Regency_Crisis_of_1788"></a></p>
<h2>Regency Crisis of 1788</h2>
<p>It is hypothesized George III suffered from an hereditary disease known as <a href="/wiki/Porphyria.html" title="Porphyria">porphyria</a>. In the summer of 1788, the disease took a great toll on the King's mental health, but he was nonetheless able to discharge some of his duties. Thus, he was able to declare Parliament <a href="/wiki/Prorogation.html" title="Prorogation">prorogued</a> from <a href="/wiki/September_25.html" title="September 25">25 September</a> to <a href="/wiki/November_20.html" title="November 20">20 November</a> 1788. During the prorogation, however, George III became deranged, posing a threat to his own life, and when Parliament reconvened in November the King could not deliver the customary <a href="/wiki/Speech_from_the_Throne.html" title="Speech from the Throne">Speech from the Throne</a> during the <a href="/wiki/State_Opening_of_Parliament.html" title="State Opening of Parliament">State Opening of Parliament</a>. Parliament found itself in an untenable position; according to long-established law, it could not proceed to any business until the delivery of the King's Speech at a State Opening.</p>
<p>Although theoretically barred from doing so, Parliament began debating a Regency. In the House of Commons, <a href="/wiki/Charles_James_Fox.html" title="Charles James Fox">Charles James Fox</a> declared his opinion that the Prince of Wales was automatically entitled to exercise sovereignty during the King's incapacity. A contrasting opinion was held by the Prime Minister, <a href="/wiki/William_Pitt_the_Younger.html" title="William Pitt the Younger">William Pitt the Younger</a>, who argued that, in the absence of a statute to the contrary, the right to choose a Regent belonged to Parliament alone. He even stated that, without parliamentary authority "the Prince of Wales had no more right … to assume the government, than any other individual subject of the country." Though disagreeing on the principle underlying a Regency, Pitt agreed with Fox that the Prince of Wales would be the most convenient choice for a Regent.</p>
<p>The Prince of Wales—though offended by Pitt's boldness—did not lend his full support to Fox's philosophy. The prince's brother, <a href="/wiki/Prince_Frederick%2C_Duke_of_York.html" title="Prince Frederick, Duke of York">Prince Frederick, Duke of York</a>, declared that the prince would not attempt to exercise any power without previously obtaining the consent of Parliament. Following the passage of a number of preliminary resolutions, Pitt outlined a formal plan for the Regency, suggesting that the powers of the Prince of Wales be greatly limited. (Among other things, the Prince of Wales could neither sell the King's property nor grant a <a href="/wiki/Peerage.html" title="Peerage">peerage</a> to anyone other than a child of the King). The Prince of Wales denounced Pitt's scheme, declaring it a "project for producing weakness, disorder, and insecurity in every branch of the administration of affairs." In the interests of the nation, both factions agreed to compromise.</p>
<p>A significant technical impediment to any Regency Bill involved the lack of a Speech from the Throne, which was necessary before Parliament could proceed to any debates or votes. The Speech was normally delivered by the King, but could also be delivered by royal representatives known as <a href="/wiki/Lords_Commissioners.html" title="Lords Commissioners">Lords Commissioners</a>, but no document could empower the Lords Commissioners to act unless the <a href="/wiki/Great_Seal_of_the_Realm.html" title="Great Seal of the Realm">Great Seal of the Realm</a> was affixed to it. The Seal could not be legally affixed without the prior authorisation of the Sovereign. Pitt and his fellow ministers ignored the last requirement and instructed the <a href="/wiki/Lord_Chancellor.html" title="Lord Chancellor">Lord Chancellor</a> to affix the Great Seal without the King's consent. This course of action was denounced as a "phantom," as a "<a href="/wiki/Legal_fiction.html" title="Legal fiction">fiction</a>," and even as a "forgery." The Prince of Wales's brother, the Duke of York, described the plan as "unconstitutional and illegal." Nevertheless, others in Parliament felt that such a scheme was necessary to preserve an effective government. Consequently, on <a href="/wiki/February_3.html" title="February 3">3 February</a> <a href="/wiki/1789.html" title="1789">1789</a>, more than two months after it had convened, Parliament was formally opened by an "illegal" group of Lords Commissioners. The Regency Bill was introduced, but, before it could be passed, the King recovered. Retroactively, the King declared that the instrument authorising the Lords Commissioners to act was valid.</p>

<p><a name="Marriage" id="Marriage"></a></p>
<h2>Marriage</h2>
<p>The Prince of Wales's debts continued to climb; his father refused to aid him unless he married his cousin, <a href="/wiki/Caroline_of_Brunswick.html" title="Caroline of Brunswick">Caroline of Brunswick</a>. In 1795, the Prince of Wales acquiesced. The marriage, however, was disastrous; each party was unsuited to the other. The two were formally separated after the birth of their only child, <a href="/wiki/Charlotte_Augusta.html" title="Charlotte Augusta">Princess Charlotte</a>, in 1796, and remained separated for the rest of their lives. The Prince of Wales remained attached to Mrs Fitzherbert for the remainder of his life, despite several periods of estrangement.</p>
<p>Even before meeting Mrs Fitzherbert, the Prince of Wales had fathered several illegitimate children. His mistresses included <a href="/wiki/Mary_Robinson_%28poet%29.html" title="Mary Robinson (poet)">Mary Robinson</a>, an actress who got revenge for her rejection by selling his letters to the newspapers; <a href="/wiki/Grace_Elliott.html" title="Grace Elliott">Grace Elliott</a>, the Scottish wife of a sought-after London physician; <a href="/wiki/Olga_Zherebtsova.html" title="Olga Zherebtsova">Olga Zherebtsova</a>, a Russian noble lady who claimed to have had a child by him; and <a href="/wiki/Frances_Villiers%2C_Countess_of_Jersey.html" title="Frances Villiers, Countess of Jersey">Frances Villiers, Countess of Jersey</a>, who dominated his life for some years.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the problem of the Prince of Wales's debts, which amounted to the extraordinary sum of £660,000 in 1796, was solved (at least temporarily) by Parliament. Being unwilling to make an outright grant to relieve these debts, it provided him an additional sum of £65,000 per annum. In 1803, a further £60,000 was added, and the Prince of Wales's debts were finally paid.</p>

The Lords Commissioners, in the name of the King, signified the granting of the <a href="/wiki/Royal_Assent.html" title="Royal Assent">Royal Assent</a> to a bill that became the <a href="/wiki/Regency_Act_1811.html" title="Regency Act 1811">Regency Act 1811</a>. Parliament restricted some of the powers of the Prince Regent (as the Prince of Wales became known). The constraints expired one year after the passage of the Act.</p>
<p>As the Prince of Wales became Prince Regent, one of the most important political conflicts facing the country concerned <a href="/wiki/Catholic_Emancipation.html" title="Catholic Emancipation">Catholic Emancipation</a>, the project to relieve <a href="/wiki/Roman_Catholicism.html" title="Roman Catholicism">Roman Catholics</a> of various political disabilities. The Tories, led by the Prime Minister, <a href="/wiki/Spencer_Perceval.html" title="Spencer Perceval">Spencer Perceval</a>, were opposed to Catholic Emancipation, while the Whigs supported it. At the beginning of the Regency, the Prince of Wales indicated that he would support the Whig leader, <a href="/wiki/William_Wyndham_Grenville%2C_1st_Baron_Grenville.html" title="William Wyndham Grenville, 1st Baron Grenville">William Wyndham Grenville, 1st Baron Grenville</a>. He did not, however, immediately put Lord Grenville and the Whigs in office. He claimed that a sudden dismissal of the Tory government would exact too great a toll on the health of the King (a steadfast supporter of the Tories), thereby eliminating any chance of a recovery. In 1812, when it appeared highly unlikely that the King would recover, the Prince of Wales failed to appoint a new Whig administration. Instead, he asked the Whigs to join the existing ministry under Spencer Perceval. The Whigs, however, refused to co-operate because of disagreements over Catholic Emancipation. Angrily, the Prince of Wales allowed Perceval to continue as Prime Minister.</p>
<p>When, in May 1812, <a href="/wiki/John_Bellingham.html" title="John Bellingham">John Bellingham</a> assassinated Spencer Perceval, the Prince of Wales was prepared to reappoint all the members of the Perceval ministry under a new leader, except that the House of Commons formally declared its desire for a more "strong and efficient administration." The Prince of Wales then offered leadership of the government to <a href="/wiki/Richard_Wellesley%2C_1st_Marquess_Wellesley.html" title="Richard Wellesley, 1st Marquess Wellesley">Richard Wellesley, 1st Marquess Wellesley</a>, and afterwards to <a href="/wiki/Francis_Rawdon-Hastings%2C_1st_Marquess_of_Hastings.html" title="Francis Rawdon-Hastings, 1st Marquess of Hastings">Francis Rawdon-Hastings, 2nd Earl of Moira</a>. He doomed the attempts of both to failure, however, by forcing each to construct a bipartisan ministry at a time when neither party wished to share power with the other. Using the failure of the two peers as a pretext, the Prince Regent immediately reappointed the Perceval administration, with Robert Banks Jenkinson, 2nd Earl of Liverpool, as Prime Minister.</p>
<p>The Tories, unlike Whigs such as <a href="/wiki/Charles_Grey%2C_2nd_Earl_Grey.html" title="Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey">Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey</a>, sought to continue the vigorous prosecution of the war against the powerful and aggressive Emperor of <a href="/wiki/France.html" title="France">France</a>, <a href="/wiki/Napoleon_I_of_France.html" title="Napoleon I of France">Napoleon I</a>. <a href="/wiki/Russia.html" title="Russia">Russia</a>, <a href="/wiki/Prussia.html" title="Prussia">Prussia</a>, <a href="/wiki/Sweden.html" title="Sweden">Sweden</a>, <a href="/wiki/Austria.html" title="Austria">Austria</a>, the United Kingdom and several smaller countries defeated Napoleon in 1814. In the subsequent <a href="/wiki/Congress_of_Vienna.html" title="Congress of Vienna">Congress of Vienna</a>, it was decided that the <a href="/wiki/Hanover_%28state%29.html" title="Hanover (state)">Electorate of Hanover</a>, a state that had shared a monarch with Britain since 1714, would be raised to a Kingdom. Napoleon made a return in 1815, but was defeated at the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Waterloo.html" title="Battle of Waterloo">Battle of Waterloo</a> by <a href="/wiki/Arthur_Wellesley%2C_1st_Duke_of_Wellington.html" title="Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington">Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington</a>, the brother of the Marquess Wellesley. Also in 1815, the <a href="/wiki/War_of_1812.html" title="War of 1812">British-American War</a> (also called the War of 1812) was brought to an end, with neither side victorious.</p>
<p>During this period George took an active interest in matters of style and taste, and his associates such as the dandy <a href="/wiki/Beau_Brummell.html" title="Beau Brummell">Beau Brummell</a> and the architect <a href="/wiki/John_Nash_%28architect%29.html" title="John Nash (architect)">John Nash</a> created the <a href="/wiki/Regency_style.html" title="Regency style">Regency style</a>.

George took up the new idea of the seaside spa and had the <a href="/wiki/Brighton_Pavilion.html" title="Brighton Pavilion">Brighton Pavilion</a> developed as a fantastical seaside palace, adapted by Nash in the "Indian Gothic" style inspired loosely by the <a href="/wiki/Taj_Mahal.html" title="Taj Mahal">Taj Mahal</a>, with extravagant "Indian" and "Chinese" interiors.</p>

<p>When George III died in 1820, the Prince Regent ascended the throne as George IV, with no real change in his powers. By the time of his accession, he was obese and possibly addicted to <a href="/wiki/Laudanum.html" title="Laudanum">laudanum</a>. He also showed some signs of the disease that had affected his father.</p>
<p>George IV's relationship with his wife Caroline had deteriorated by the time of his accession. They had lived separately since 1796, and both were having affairs. Caroline had later left the United Kingdom for Europe, but she chose to return for her husband's coronation, and to publicly assert her rights. However, George IV refused to recognize Caroline as Queen, commanding British ambassadors to ensure that monarchs in foreign courts did the same. By royal command, Caroline's name was omitted from the <a href="/wiki/Liturgy.html" title="Liturgy">liturgy</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Church_of_England.html" title="Church of England">Church of England</a>. The King sought a divorce, but his advisors suggested that any divorce proceedings might involve the publication of details relating to the King's own adulterous relationships. Therefore, he requested and ensured the introduction of the <a href="/wiki/Pains_and_Penalties_Bill_1820.html" title="Pains and Penalties Bill 1820">Pains and Penalties Bill 1820</a>, under which Parliament could have imposed legal penalties without a trial in a court of law. The bill would have annulled the marriage and stripped Caroline of the title of Queen. The bill proved extremely unpopular, and was withdrawn from Parliament. George IV decided, nonetheless, to exclude his wife from his coronation at <a href="/wiki/Westminster_Abbey.html" title="Westminster Abbey">Westminster Abbey</a>, on <a href="/wiki/July_19.html" title="July 19">19 July</a> <a href="/wiki/1821.html" title="1821">1821</a>.

<p>George's coronation was a magnificent and expensive affair, costing about £943,000. Despite the enormous cost, it was a popular event. Many across the nation bought souvenirs that bore copies of the coronation portrait by <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Lawrence.html" title="Thomas Lawrence">Sir Thomas Lawrence</a>. In 1822, the King visited <a href="/wiki/Edinburgh.html" title="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a> for "one and twenty daft days."

<p><a name="The_Catholic_Question" id="The_Catholic_Question"></a></p>
<h2>The Catholic Question</h2>
<p>George IV spent the majority of his reign in seclusion at <a href="/wiki/Windsor_Castle.html" title="Windsor Castle">Windsor Castle</a>, but continued to interfere in politics. At first, it was believed that he would support Catholic Emancipation, but his anti-Catholic views became clear in 1824. The influence of the Crown was so great, and the will of the Tories under Prime Minister Lord Liverpool so strong, that Catholic Emancipation seemed hopeless. In 1827, however, Lord Liverpool retired, to be replaced by the pro-Emancipation Tory <a href="/wiki/George_Canning.html" title="George Canning">George Canning</a>. When Canning entered office, the King, who was hitherto content with privately instructing his ministers on the Catholic Question, thought it fit to make a more bold declaration. It was made known that "his sentiments … on the Catholic question, were those his revered father, George III, and lamented brother, the Duke of York, had maintained during their lives, and which he himself had professed when Prince of Wales, and which nothing could shake; finally, … that the recent ministerial arrangements were the result of circumstances, to His Majesty equally unforeseen and unpleasant."</p>
<p>Canning's views on the Catholic Question were not well-received by the most conservative Tories, including the Duke of Wellington. As a result, the ministry was forced to include Whigs. Canning died later in that year, leaving <a href="/wiki/Frederick_John_Robinson%2C_1st_Viscount_Goderich.html" title="Frederick John Robinson, 1st Viscount Goderich">Frederick John Robinson, 1st Viscount Goderich</a> to lead the tenuous Tory-Whig coalition. Lord Goderich left office in 1828, to be succeeded by the Duke of Wellington, who had by that time accepted that the denial of some measure of relief to Roman Catholics was politically untenable. With great difficulty, Wellington obtained the King's consent to the introduction of a Catholic Relief Bill. The King afterwards withdrew his approval, yet he granted it again. Relief was granted to Catholics in 1829.</p>

<h2>Later life</h2>
<p>George IV's heavy drinking and indulgent lifestyle took its toll on his health by the 1820s. Towards the end of his life, he also began to show symptoms of mental illness but never to the same extent as his father. He claimed to have been a soldier and to have fought at the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Waterloo.html" title="Battle of Waterloo">Battle of Waterloo</a>.<sup id="_ref-later_mental_illness_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[1]</a></sup> He died in 1830 and was buried in Windsor Castle. His daughter, Princess Charlotte Augusta of Wales, had died from post-partum complications in 1817, after delivering a still-born son; his eldest younger brother, Frederick, the Duke of York, had pre-deceased him in 1827. He was therefore succeeded by another of his brothers, <a href="/wiki/William_IV_of_the_United_Kingdom.html" title="William IV of the United Kingdom">Prince William, Duke of Clarence</a>, who reigned as William IV.</p>
