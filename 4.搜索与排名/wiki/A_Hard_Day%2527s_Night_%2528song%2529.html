<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Title inspired by Ringo-ism">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Title_inspired_by_Ringo-ism" id="Title_inspired_by_Ringo-ism"></a></p>
<h2>Title inspired by Ringo-ism</h2>
<p>The song's strange title originated from something said by <a href="/wiki/Ringo_Starr.html" title="Ringo Starr">Ringo Starr</a>, The Beatles' <a href="/wiki/Drummer.html" title="Drummer">drummer</a>. Starr described it this way in an interview with <a href="/wiki/Disc_jockey.html" title="Disc jockey">disc jockey</a> <a href="/wiki/Dave_Hull.html" title="Dave Hull">Dave Hull</a> in 1964: "We went to do a job, and we'd worked all day and we happened to work all night. I came up still thinking it was day I suppose, and I said, 'It's been a hard day...' and I looked around and saw it was dark so I said, '...night!' So we came to 'A Hard Day's Night.'"</p>
<p>Starr's statement was the inspiration for the title of the movie, which in turn inspired the composition of the song. According to <a href="/wiki/John_Lennon.html" title="John Lennon">John Lennon</a> in a 1980 interview with <i><a href="/wiki/Playboy.html" title="Playboy">Playboy</a></i> magazine: "I was going home in the car and <a href="/wiki/Richard_Lester.html" title="Richard Lester">Dick Lester</a> [director of the movie] suggested the title, 'Hard Day's Night' from something Ringo had said. I had used it in 'In His Own Write' [a book Lennon was writing then], but it was an off-the-cuff remark by Ringo. You know, one of those <a href="/wiki/Malapropism.html" title="Malapropism">malapropisms</a>. A Ringo-ism, where he said it not to be funny... just said it. So Dick Lester said, 'We are going to use that title.'"</p>
<p>In a 1994 interview for <i><a href="/wiki/The_Beatles_Anthology.html" title="The Beatles Anthology">The Beatles Anthology</a></i>, however, <a href="/wiki/Paul_McCartney.html" title="Paul McCartney">Paul McCartney</a> disagreed with Lennon's recollections, basically stating that it was The Beatles and not Lester, who had come up with the idea of using Starr's verbal misstep: "The title was Ringo's. We'd almost finished making the film, and this fun bit arrived that we'd not known about before, which was naming the film. So we were sitting around at Twickenham studios having a little brain-storming session... and we said, 'Well, there was something Ringo said the other day.' Ringo would do these little malapropisms, he would say things slightly wrong, like people do, but his were always wonderful, very lyrical... they were sort of magic even though he was just getting it wrong. And he said after a concert, 'Phew, it's been a hard day's night.'"</p>
<p>In 1996, yet another version of events cropped up — in an <a href="/wiki/Associated_Press.html" title="Associated Press">Associated Press</a> report, the producer of the movie <i>A Hard Day's Night</i>, <a  class="new" title="Walter Shenson">Walter Shenson</a>, stated that Lennon described to Shenson some of Starr's funnier gaffes, including "a hard day's night," whereupon Shenson immediately decided that that was going to be the title of the movie (the originally planned title was <i>Beatlemania</i>). Shenson then told Lennon that he needed a theme song for the film.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: The making">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="The_making" id="The_making"></a></p>
<h2>The making</h2>
<p>Regardless of who decided on the title, Lennon immediately made up his mind that he would compose the movie's title track. Both <a href="/wiki/Lennon-McCartney.html" title="Lennon-McCartney">Lennon and McCartney</a> were credited as co-authors, though the two of them did not actually work on their songs together — instead, one would write the majority of the song, and the other would critique it. (In some cases, even when there was no input from the other Beatle, such as on "<a href="/wiki/Yesterday_%28song%29.html" title="Yesterday (song)">Yesterday</a>", both of them would still be credited as authors.) It was a <a href="/wiki/Symbiosis.html" title="Symbiosis">symbiosis</a> that could be described as friendly competition.</p>
<p>Lennon dashed off the song in one night, and brought it in for comments the following morning (the original manuscript lyrics may be seen in the <a href="/wiki/British_Library.html" title="British Library">British Library</a>, scribbled in ballpoint on the back of an old birthday card). As he described in his <i>Playboy</i> interview, page 148, "...the next morning I brought in the song... 'cuz there was a little competition between Paul and I as to who got the A-side — who got the hits. If you notice, in the early days the majority of singles, in the movies and everything, were mine... in the early period I'm dominating the group.... The reason Paul sang on A Hard Day's Night (in the bridge) is because I couldn't reach the notes."</p>
<p>In the Associated Press report, Shenson described his recollection of what happened. At 8:30 in the morning, "There were John and Paul with guitars at the ready and all the lyrics scribbled on matchbook covers. They played it and the next night recorded it." Shenson declared, "It had the right beat and the arrangement was brilliant. These guys were geniuses."</p>
<p>During that period of time, The Beatles were being interviewed by reporter <a href="/wiki/Maureen_Cleave.html" title="Maureen Cleave">Maureen Cleave</a> of <a href="/wiki/London.html" title="London">London</a>'s <i><a href="/wiki/Evening_Standard.html" title="Evening Standard">Evening Standard</a></i>. Lennon showed Cleave the lyrics, and she suggested to him that the lines "I find my tiredness is through/And I feel alright" sounded weak. Lennon eventually replaced the lines in question with "I find the things that you do/They make me feel alright".</p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/April_16.html" title="April 16">April 16</a>, <a href="/wiki/1964_in_music.html" title="1964 in music">1964</a>, The Beatles gathered at Studio 2 of the <a href="/wiki/Abbey_Road_Studios.html" title="Abbey Road Studios">Abbey Road Studios</a> and recorded "A Hard Day's Night". It took them less than three hours to polish the song for its final release, eventually selecting the ninth take as the one to be released.</p>

<h2>The release</h2>
<p>"A Hard Day's Night" was first released to the United States, coming out on <a href="/wiki/June_13.html" title="June 13">June 13</a>, 1964 on the album <i><a href="/wiki/A_Hard_Day%27s_Night.html" title="A Hard Day's Night">A Hard Day's Night</a></i>, the soundtrack to the film, and released by <a href="/wiki/United_Artists.html" title="United Artists">United Artists</a>. The album was a hit, selling a million copies in just four days.</p>

The single of "A Hard Day's Night" reached the top of the British charts within 15 days of its release.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>"A Hard Day's Night" was the first Beatles single released in the UK to not use a pronoun in its title. On all of their previous British singles {"Love <i>Me</i> Do," "Please Please <i>Me</i>," "From <i>Me</i> to <i>You</i>." "<i>She</i> Loves <i>You</i>," "<i>I</i> Want to Hold Your Hand," and "Can't Buy <i>Me</i> Love"), the group had intentionally relied on the use of a pronoun to make a song "very direct and personal," so that, according to Paul McCartney, "people can identify...with it."1</p>
<p>The United Kingdom first heard "A Hard Day's Night" when it was released there on <a href="/wiki/July_10.html" title="July 10">July 10</a>, 1964, both on the album <i>A Hard Day's Night</i>, and as a single, backed with "Things We Said Today" on the B-side. Both the album and single were released by <a href="/wiki/Parlophone_Records.html" title="Parlophone Records">Parlophone Records</a>. The album proceeded to sell 1.5 million copies within a fortnight of its release. The single began charting on <a href="/wiki/July_18.html" title="July 18">July 18</a>, 1964, a week later ousting <a href="/wiki/The_Rolling_Stones.html" title="The Rolling Stones">the Rolling Stones</a>' "It's All Over Now" from the top spot on the British charts on <a href="/wiki/July_25.html" title="July 25">July 25</a>, 1964, coincidentally the day when both the American and British albums too hit the peak of their respective charts. The single stayed on top for three weeks, and lasted another nine weeks in the charts afterwards.</p>
<p>America first saw the single of "A Hard Day's Night" on <a href="/wiki/July_13.html" title="July 13">July 13</a>, 1964, featuring "I Should Have Known Better" on the B-side, and released by <a href="/wiki/Capitol_Records.html" title="Capitol Records">Capitol Records</a>. Capitol had been in a quandary about cashing in on the success of the movie <i>A Hard Day's Night</i>, as United Artists held the publishing rights for the soundtrack (thus owning the rights to release the album of the same title). However, there was nothing preventing Capitol from releasing the songs in other forms, leading to six out of the seven songs from the movie's soundtrack coming out on singles.</p>
<p>The American single began its 13-week chart run on five days after release, and on <a href="/wiki/August_1.html" title="August 1">August 1</a> started a two-week long run at the top, setting a new record—nobody before had ever held the number one position on both the album and singles charts in the United Kingdom and the United States at the same time. The Beatles were the first to do so, and continued to be the only ones who had done this until 1970 when <a href="/wiki/Simon_and_Garfunkel.html" title="Simon and Garfunkel">Simon and Garfunkel</a> achieved the same feat with their album <i><a href="/wiki/Bridge_Over_Troubled_Water.html" title="Bridge Over Troubled Water">Bridge Over Troubled Water</a></i> and its title track. "A Hard Day's Night" went on to sell one million copies in America within just over five weeks.</p>
<p>After The Beatles had performed on <i><a href="/wiki/The_Ed_Sullivan_Show.html" title="The Ed Sullivan Show">The Ed Sullivan Show</a></i> when they first came to America in early 1964, some American critics had dismissed them as one-hit wonders. "A Hard Day's Night" proved them wrong, as it only strengthened The Beatles' dominance of the world music scene in 1964. They would continue to feature prominently for the next six years until their disbanding in 1970.</p>
<p>In 1965, "A Hard Day's Night" won The Beatles the <a href="/wiki/Grammy_Award_for_Best_Performance_by_a_Vocal_Group.html" title="Grammy Award for Best Performance by a Vocal Group">Grammy Award for Best Performance by a Vocal Group</a>. It was later ranked #153 on <a href="/wiki/Rolling_Stone.html" title="Rolling Stone">Rolling Stone</a>'s list of the <a href="/wiki/500_Greatest_Songs_of_All_Time.html" title="500 Greatest Songs of All Time">500 Greatest Songs of All Time</a>.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Opening chord">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Opening_chord" id="Opening_chord"></a></p>
<h2>Opening chord</h2>
<p>"A Hard Day's Night" is immediately identifiable before the vocals even begin, thanks to <a href="/wiki/George_Harrison.html" title="George Harrison">George Harrison</a>'s unmistakable <a href="/wiki/Rickenbacker.html" title="Rickenbacker">Rickenbacker</a> 12-string <a href="/wiki/Guitar.html" title="Guitar">guitar</a>'s opening chord. The exact <a href="/wiki/Chord_%28music%29.html" title="Chord (music)">chord</a> played by Harrison has been the subject of contention. According to <a  class="new" title="Walter Everett">Walter Everett</a> (2001: 236-37), the opening chord has an introductory dominant function because McCartney plays D in the bass; Harrison and Martin play F A C G in twelve-string guitar and piano, over the bass D, giving the chord a mixture-colored neighbor, F; two diatonic neighbors, A and C; plus an anticipation of the tonic, G — the major subtonic as played on guitar being a <a href="/wiki/Borrowed_chord#Borrowed_chords.html" title="Borrowed chord">borrowed chord</a> commonly used by The Beatles, first in "P.S. I Love You" (see <a href="/wiki/Mode_mixture.html" title="Mode mixture">mode mixture</a>), and later in "Every Little Thing", "Tomorrow Never Knows" and "Got to Get You into My Life" (in the latter two against a tonic <a href="/wiki/Pedal_point.html" title="Pedal point">pedal</a>).</p>
<p>Contrastingly, Alan W. Pollack (<a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.icce.rug.nl/~soundscapes/DATABASES/AWP/ahdn.html">[1]</a>) interprets the chord as a surrogate dominant (surrogate V, the dominant preparing or leading to the tonic chord), in G major the dominant being D, with the G being an <a href="/wiki/Anticipation.html" title="Anticipation">anticipation</a> that resolves in the G major chord that opens the verse. He also suggests it is a mixture of d minor, F major, and G major (missing the B). Tony Bacon (2000: 5) calls it a Dm7sus4 (D F G A C), which is the dominant seventh (plus the fourth, G). For more information regarding chord functions see <a href="/wiki/Diatonic_function.html" title="Diatonic function">diatonic function</a>.</p>
<p>Everett (2001: 109) points out that the chord relates to the Beatles' interest in <a href="/wiki/Pandiatonic.html" title="Pandiatonic">pandiatonic</a> harmony.</p>
<p>Dominic Pedler (2003) has also provided an interpretation of the famous chord, with The Beatles and George Martin playing the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>George Harrison:</b> Fadd9 in 1st position on 12-string electric guitar</li>
<li><b>John Lennon:</b> Fadd9 in 1st position on a 6-string acoustic guitar</li>
<li><b>Paul McCartney:</b> high D played on the D-string, 12th fret on electric bass</li>
<li><b>George Martin:</b> D2-G2-D3 played on a Steinway Grand Piano</li>
<li><b>Ringo Starr:</b> Subtle snare drum and ride cymbal</li>
</ul>
<p>This gives the notes: <b>G-B-D-F-A-C</b> (the B is a harmonic). One of the interesting things about this chord (as described by Pedler) is how McCartney's high bass note reverberates inside the soundbox of Lennon's acoustic guitar and begins to be picked up on Lennon's <a href="/wiki/Microphone.html" title="Microphone">microphone</a> or <a href="/wiki/Pickup_%28music%29.html" title="Pickup (music)">pick-up</a> during the sounding of the chord. This gives the chord its special "wavy" and unstable quality. Pedler describes the effect as a "virtual <a href="/wiki/Pull-off.html" title="Pull-off">pull-off</a>".</p>
<p>Jason Brown, Professor for the Faculty of <a href="/wiki/Computer_Science.html" title="Computer Science">Computer Science</a> at <a href="/wiki/Dalhousie_University.html" title="Dalhousie University">Dalhousie University</a> in <a href="/wiki/Halifax%2C_Nova_Scotia.html" title="Halifax, Nova Scotia">Halifax</a>, whose research interests include <a href="/wiki/Graph_theory.html" title="Graph theory">graph theory</a>, <a href="/wiki/Combinatorics.html" title="Combinatorics">combinatorics</a>, and combinatorial <a href="/wiki/Algorithm.html" title="Algorithm">algorithms</a>, announced in October 2004 that after six months of reseach he succeeded in analyzing the opening chord by "de-composing the sound into original frequencies, using a combination of computer software and old-fashioned chalkboard." According to Brown, the Rickenbacker guitar wasn't the only instrument used. "It wasn't just George Harrison playing it and it wasn't just The Beatles playing on it... There was a piano in the mix." To be exact, he claims that Harrison was playing the following notes on his 12 string guitar: a2, a3, d3, d4, g3, g4, c4, and another c4; McCartney played a d3 on his bass; producer George Martin was playing d3, f3, d5, g5, and e6 on the piano, while Lennon played a loud c5 on his six-string guitar.</p>

<h2>Music and lyrics</h2>
<p>The song is composed in the key of <a href="/wiki/G_major.html" title="G major">G major</a> and in a 4/4 <a href="/wiki/Time_signature.html" title="Time signature">time signature</a>, though Richard Middleton (1990) describes G as the dominant in the key of <a href="/wiki/C_major.html" title="C major">C major</a>. The verse features the ♭VII or major subtonic chord that was a part of the opening chord as an ornament or embellishment below the tonic. The <a href="/wiki/Modal_frame_%28music%29.html" title="Modal frame (music)">modal frame</a> of the song though <a href="/wiki/Pentatonic.html" title="Pentatonic">pentatonic</a> features a <a href="/wiki/Ladder_of_thirds.html" title="Ladder of thirds">ladder of thirds</a> axially centered on G with a ceiling note of Bb and floor note of Eb (the low C being a <a href="/wiki/Passing_tone.html" title="Passing tone">passing tone</a>) (Middleton 1990, p.203):</p>
<p><a  class="image" title="A Hard Day's Night Melody"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f8/A_Hard_Day%27s_Night_melodyd.PNG/550px-A_Hard_Day%27s_Night_melodyd.PNG" alt="A Hard Day's Night Melody" width="550" height="291" longdesc="/wiki/Image:A_Hard_Day%27s_Night_melodyd.PNG" /></a></p>
<p>According to Middleton (ibid, p.201) the song has "a deep kinship with typical blues melodic structures: it is centered on three of the notes of the minor-pentatonic mode (Eb-G-Bb), with the contradictory major seventh (B♮) set against that. Morever, the <i>shape</i> assumed by these notes - the modal <i>frame</i> - as well as the abstract scale they represent, is revealed, too; and this - an initial, repeated circling round the dominant (G), with an excursion to its minor third (Bb), 'answered' by a fall to the 'symmetrical' minor third of the tonic (Eb) - is a common pattern in blues."</p>
<p>Lennon opens the twelve measure-long <a href="/wiki/Verse.html" title="Verse">verse</a> and carries it along, suddenly joined at the end by McCartney, who then sings the <a href="/wiki/Bridge_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Bridge (disambiguation)">bridge</a>. This represented a division of work which would feature prominently in future Beatles songs, with Lennon and McCartney each singing the parts they composed individually. This also made it easier to identify the individual styles of each composer, as McCartney was often the one with more upbeat lyrics, while Lennon's would be in a more cynical tone.</p>
<p>However, in his interview with <i>Playboy</i>, Lennon denied that McCartney's authorship of the bridge was the reason that he sang it: "The only reason he sang on 'A Hard Day's Night' was because I couldn't reach the notes. ...which is what we'd do sometimes. One of us couldn't reach a note but he wanted a different sound, so he'd get the other to do the harmony."</p>
<p>There is also an instrumental <a href="/wiki/Break_%28music%29.html" title="Break (music)">break</a>, performed by George Harrison.</p>
<p>The song closes with Harrison's guitar-playing fading out, the first time The Beatles had used such a technique — most, if not all, of their earlier work had closed with a final chord (and <a href="/wiki/Cadence_%28music%29.html" title="Cadence (music)">cadence</a>), such as "<a href="/wiki/She_Loves_You.html" title="She Loves You">She Loves You</a>" and "<a href="/wiki/I_Want_To_Hold_Your_Hand.html" title="I Want To Hold Your Hand">I Want To Hold Your Hand</a>".</p>
<p>The actual lyrics speak about the singer's undying devotion to his lover, and how he toils so she can purchase the items she fancies. The singer sings about his tiredness when he comes home from work, but how the things that his lover does perk him up.</p>
