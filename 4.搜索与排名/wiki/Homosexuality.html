<p><b>Homosexuality</b> refers to <a href="/wiki/Sexual_attraction.html" title="Sexual attraction">sexual</a> and <a href="/wiki/Romantic_love.html" title="Romantic love">romantic</a> attraction between two individuals of the same <a href="/wiki/Sex.html" title="Sex">sex</a>.

<p>Homosexuality is usually contrasted with <a href="/wiki/Heterosexuality.html" title="Heterosexuality">heterosexuality</a> and <a href="/wiki/Bisexuality.html" title="Bisexuality">bisexuality</a>. The term <i><a href="/wiki/Gay.html" title="Gay">gay</a></i> is used predominantly to refer to homosexual <a href="/wiki/Male.html" title="Male">males</a>. <i><a href="/wiki/Lesbian.html" title="Lesbian">Lesbian</a></i> is a gender-specific term that is only used for homosexual <a href="/wiki/Female.html" title="Female">females</a>. The adjective <i>homosexual</i> is also used for same-sex <a href="/wiki/Human_sexual_behavior.html" title="Human sexual behavior">sexual relations</a> between persons of the same sex who are not gay or lesbian. Three major forms of homosexual relationships are proposed by anthropologists: egalitarian, gender-structured, and age-structured. Of these, one is usually dominant in a given society at a given time. (See <a  title="">Forms</a> below.) As there are different biological, historical and psychosocial components to sex and gender, no single label or description will fit all individuals. <i>Find articles on sex and gender at <a href="/wiki/Sex.html" title="Sex">sex</a> and <a href="/wiki/Homosexuality_and_transgender.html" title="Homosexuality and transgender">homosexuality and transgender</a></i>.</p>

<p>The word <i>homosexual</i> is both an adjective and a noun. The adjectival form literally means “same sex”, being a <a href="/wiki/Hybrid_word.html" title="Hybrid word">hybrid</a> formed from the <a href="/wiki/Greek_language.html" title="Greek language">Greek</a> prefix <i>homo–</i>, which means “same”, and the Latin root <i>sex–</i>, which means “sex” or "gender". Its first known appearance in print is found in an 1869 German pamphlet by the Austrian-born novelist <a href="/wiki/Karl-Maria_Kertbeny.html" title="Karl-Maria Kertbeny">Karl-Maria Kertbeny</a> and published anonymously.</p>
<p>The term <i>homosexual</i> can be used to describe individuals' sexual orientation, sexual history, or self-identification. Many who engage in such relations reject the term as too clinical and somewhat dehumanizing.<sup title="The text in the vicinity of this tag needs citation." class="noprint">[<a  title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><i>citation&#160;needed</i></a>]</sup> Much of that sentiment arose while homosexuality was still classified as a mental illness in the <a href="/wiki/Diagnostic_and_Statistical_Manual_of_Mental_Disorders.html" title="Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</a>.<sup title="The text in the vicinity of this tag needs citation." class="noprint">[<a  title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><i>citation&#160;needed</i></a>]</sup> As a result, the terms <i>gay</i> and <i>lesbian</i> are generally preferred when discussing a person of this <a href="/wiki/Sexual_orientation.html" title="Sexual orientation">sexual orientation</a>, whose sexual history is predominated by this behavior, or who identifies as such. The first letters are frequently combined to create the acronym LGBT (which is also written as GLBT, in which B and T refer to <a href="/wiki/Bisexuality.html" title="Bisexuality">bisexuals</a> and <a href="/wiki/Transgender.html" title="Transgender">transgender</a> individuals). Some same-sex oriented people personally prefer the term "homosexual" rather than "gay", as they may perceive the former as describing a sexual orientation and the latter as describing a cultural or socio-political group with which they do not identify.</p>
<p>Although early writers also used the adjective <i>homosexual</i> to refer to any single-gender context (such as an all-girls' school), today the term is used exclusively for sexual attraction. The term <i>homosocial</i> is now used to describe single-sex contexts that are not specifically sexual. An alternative, more generic term referring to same-sex love, <i>homophilia</i> (“same-love”), is also in use.</p>
<p>Derogatory terms include <i><a href="/wiki/Faggot_%28epithet%29.html" title="Faggot (epithet)">faggot</a></i> (or the common abbreviation <i>fag</i>), which is used mostly in America and generally refers to gay men; <i>poof</i> or <i>poofter</i>, which are used mostly in the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom.html" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> and Commonwealth; <i><a href="/wiki/Queer.html" title="Queer">queer</a></i>, which is generally used against anyone who is not exclusively heterosexual, but also reclaimed as an affirming term by many gays and academics; <i>gay</i> and <i>homo</i>, which are commonly used by adolescents to harass each other; and <i><a href="/wiki/Dyke_%28lesbian%29.html" title="Dyke (lesbian)">dyke</a>,</i> which refers specifically to lesbians (<i>see <a href="/wiki/Homophobia.html" title="Homophobia">Homophobia</a></i>).</p>
<p>Given how misleading and overloaded various terms can be, new terms are arising for use in situations where specificity is important. For example, <i><a href="/wiki/Men_who_have_sex_with_men.html" title="Men who have sex with men">men who have sex with men</a></i>, or <i>MSM</i> for short, is sometimes used in the medical community when specifically discussing sexual behaviour (regardless of sexual orientation or self-identification). <i><a href="/wiki/Same-sex_attraction.html" title="Same-sex attraction">Same-sex attraction</a></i> focuses on spontaneous feeling, but de-emphasises identification with a demographic or cultural group, and also leaves open the possibility for co-existing opposite-sex attraction. <i><a href="/wiki/Homoeroticism.html" title="Homoeroticism">Homoerotic</a></i> is a synonym for <i><a href="/wiki/Same-sex_attraction.html" title="Same-sex attraction">same-sex attraction</a></i> that is used to refer both to personal feelings and works of art. <i>Non-straight</i> is another attempt at neutrality that is gaining currency. Some other humorous terms are now becoming more prevalent, including <i><a href="/wiki/Bi-curious.html" title="Bi-curious">heteroflexible</a></i> to refer to a person who identifies as heterosexual, but occasionally engages in same-sex sexual activities, or <i><a href="/wiki/Metrosexual.html" title="Metrosexual">metrosexual</a></i> to denote a straight man with stereotypically gay tastes in food, fashion and design.</p>

<p>The manifestation of sexual orientation is subject to a considerable variability. Thus it is common for homosexual individuals in <a href="/wiki/Heteronormativity.html" title="Heteronormativity">heteronormative</a> societies to love, marry, and have children with individuals of the opposite sex, a practice that may be done primarily for social reasons in societies which reject same-sex relations, as a cover for one's orientation (such relationships are known as "<a href="/wiki/Beard_%28female_companion%29.html" title="Beard (female companion)">beards</a>"). These adaptations are forms of <a href="/wiki/Situational_sexual_behavior.html" title="Situational sexual behavior">situational sexual behavior</a>. Also some people of either sex want to pass their genes on and have children. Homosexual men or women may marry for that reason. Lesbian women may want a child through <a href="/wiki/Artificial_insemination.html" title="Artificial insemination">Artificial insemination</a>.</p>
<p>A further, and extremely common, manifestation of situational sexual behaviour involving homosexual acts is seen in <a href="/wiki/Prison_sexuality.html" title="Prison sexuality">prisons</a> where individuals can only meet members of their own sex for long periods of time.</p>

<h4>Forms</h4>
<p>Numerous researchers studying the social construction of same-sex relationships have suggested that the concept of homosexuality would best be rendered as "homosexualities." They document that same-sex relations have been and continue to be organised in distinctly categorical ways by different societies in different eras. These variations are grouped by <a href="/wiki/Cultural_anthropology.html" title="Cultural anthropology">cultural anthropologist</a> Stephen O. Murray into three separate modes of association:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Egalitarian</b>, features two partners with no relevance to age. Additionally, both play the same socially-accepted sex role as <a href="/wiki/Heterosexuality.html" title="Heterosexuality">heterosexuals</a> of their own sex. This is exemplified by relationships currently prevalent in western society between partners of similar age and gender. <i>See <a href="/wiki/Sexuality_and_gender_identity-based_cultures.html" title="Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures">Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures</a></i></li>
<li><b>Gender structured</b> features each partner playing a different <a href="/wiki/Gender_role.html" title="Gender role">gender role</a>. This is exemplified by traditional relations between men in the <a href="/wiki/Mediterranean_Basin.html" title="Mediterranean Basin">Mediterranean Basin</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Middle_East.html" title="Middle East">Middle East</a> and <a href="/wiki/Central_Asia.html" title="Central Asia">Central</a> and <a href="/wiki/South_Asia.html" title="South Asia">South</a> <a href="/wiki/Asia.html" title="Asia">Asia</a>, as well as <a href="/wiki/Two-Spirit.html" title="Two-Spirit">Two-Spirit</a> or shamanic gender-changing practices seen in native societies. <a href="/wiki/Albania.html" title="Albania">Albania</a> also has a similar practice where a woman may choose to be an "<a  class="new" title="Albanian Virgin">Albanian Virgin</a>" and be given all the rights and entitlements of a man. In North America, this is best represented by the <a href="/wiki/Butch_and_femme.html" title="Butch and femme">butch/femme</a> practice. <i>See <a href="/wiki/Homosexuality_and_Islam.html" title="Homosexuality and Islam">Homosexuality and Islam</a>, <a href="/wiki/Two-Spirit.html" title="Two-Spirit">Two-Spirit</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Hijra_%28South_Asia%29.html" title="Hijra (South Asia)">Hijra</a></i></li>
<li><b>Age structured</b> features partners of different ages, usually one adolescent and the other adult. This is exemplified by <a href="/wiki/Pederasty.html" title="Pederasty">pederasty</a> among the <a href="/wiki/Hellenic_civilization.html" title="Hellenic civilization">Classical Greeks</a> or those engaged in by novice <a href="/wiki/Samurai.html" title="Samurai">samurai</a> with more experienced warriors; southern Chinese boy-marriage rites; and ongoing Central Asian and Middle Eastern practices. <i>See <a href="/wiki/Shudo.html" title="Shudo">Shudo</a>, <a href="/wiki/Pederasty.html" title="Pederasty">Pederasty</a>, <a href="/wiki/Historical_pederastic_couples.html" title="Historical pederastic couples">Historical pederastic couples</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Homosexuality_in_China.html" title="Homosexuality in China">Homosexuality in China</a>.</i></li>
</ul>
<p>Both gender-structured and age-structured homosexuality frequently involve one partner adopting a "passive" and the other an "active" role. Among men, being the passive partner may sometimes mean receiving <a href="/wiki/Semen.html" title="Semen">semen</a>, i.e. performing fellatio or being the receptive partner during <a href="/wiki/Anal_sex.html" title="Anal sex">anal sex</a>. This is sometimes interpreted as an emphasis on the sexual pleasure of the active partner, although this is not true in all cases. For example, in gender-structured female homosexuality in <a href="/wiki/Thailand.html" title="Thailand">Thailand</a>, active partners (<i>toms</i>) emphasise the sexual pleasure of the passive partner (<i>dee</i>), and often refuse to allow their <i>dee</i> to pleasure them.</p>
<p>Some anthropologists have argued for the existence of a fourth type of homosexuality, <a href="/wiki/Social_class.html" title="Social class">class</a>-structured homosexuality, but many scholars believe that this has no independent existence from the other three types.</p>
<p>Usually in any society one form of homosexuality predominates, though others are likely to co-exist. As historian <a href="/wiki/Rictor_Norton.html" title="Rictor Norton">Rictor Norton</a> points out in his <a  class="external text" title="http://www.infopt.demon.co.uk/social19.htm"><i>Intergenerational and Egalitarian Models,</i></a> in Ancient Greece egalitarian relationships co-existed (albeit less privileged) with the institution of <a href="/wiki/Pederasty.html" title="Pederasty">pederasty</a>, and fascination with adolescents can also be found in modern sexuality, both heterosexual and homosexual. Egalitarian homosexuality is becoming the principal form practised in the Western world, while age- and gender-structured homosexuality are becoming less common. As a byproduct of Western cultural dominance, this egalitarian homosexuality is spreading from western culture to non-Western societies, although there are still defined differences between the various cultures.</p>

<p>Estimates of the modern prevalence of homosexuality vary considerably. They are complicated by differing or even ambiguous definitions of homosexuality, and by fluctuations over time and according to location.</p>
<p>In general, surveys quoted by anti-gay activists tend to show figures nearer 1%, while surveys quoted by gay activists tend to show figures nearer 10%, with a mean of 4-5% figure most often cited in mainstream media reports.</p>
<p>It is important to note, however, that these numbers are subject to many of the pitfalls inherent in researching sensitive social issues. It is possible that survey results may be biased by under-reporting, for instance. The frequent use of non-random samples (white college students) in many studies could also serve to skew the data.</p>
<p>In general, most research agrees that the number of people who have had multiple same-gender sexual experiences is fewer than the number of people who have had a single such experience, and that the number of people who identify themselves as exclusively homosexual is fewer than the number of people who have had multiple homosexual experiences.</p>
<p>The controversial <a href="/wiki/Kinsey_Reports.html" title="Kinsey Reports">Kinsey Reports</a> of 1948 found that 37% of males had some sexual experience with other men, and that 4% had always been exclusively homosexual. Among women, Kinsey found between 2% and 6% had "more or less exclusively" homosexual experience.</p>
<p>In the <a href="/wiki/United_States.html" title="United States">United States</a> during the 2004 elections, exit polls indicated 4% of all voters self-identified as gay or lesbian. However, due to societal pressures, many who are homosexual may not be willing to identify as such, as evident in the recent forced "<a href="/wiki/Outing.html" title="Outing">outings</a>" of New Jersey Governor <a href="/wiki/Jim_McGreevey.html" title="Jim McGreevey">Jim McGreevey</a> and Spokane, Washington, Mayor <a href="/wiki/James_E._West.html" title="James E.

<p>In <a href="/wiki/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canada</a>, a 2003 report by Statistics Canada indicated that among Canadians aged 18 to 59, 1% reported that they are homosexual, and 0.7% reported to be bi-sexual. <sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a  title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/North_Africa.html" title="North Africa">North Africa</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Middle_East.html" title="Middle East">Middle East</a> and <a href="/wiki/Central_Asia.html" title="Central Asia">Central Asia</a>, where gender- or <a href="/wiki/Pederasty.html" title="Pederasty">age-structured</a> relationships are the rule, male homosexual practices are reported to be widespread, engaged in by many individuals who do not regard themselves as homosexual. <i>See <a href="/wiki/Homosexuality_and_Islam.html" title="Homosexuality and Islam">Homosexuality and Islam</a></i></p>

<p>The neurobiology of the masculinization of the brain is fairly well understood. Estradiol, and testosterone, which is catalysed by the enzyme 5α-reductase into dihydrotestosterone, act upon androgen receptors in the brain to masculinize it. If there are few androgen receptors (people with <a href="/wiki/Androgen_insensitivity_syndrome.html" title="Androgen insensitivity syndrome">Androgen insensitivity syndrome</a>) or too much androgen (females with <a href="/wiki/Congenital_adrenal_hyperplasia.html" title="Congenital adrenal hyperplasia">Congenital adrenal hyperplasia</a>) there can be physical and psychological effects.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a  title="">[3]</a></sup> It has been suggested that both male and female homosexuality are results of variation in this process.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a  title="">[4]</a></sup> In these studies lesbianism is typically linked with a higher amount of masculinization than is found in heterosexual females, though when dealing with male homosexuality there are results supporting both higher and lower degrees of masculinization than heterosexual males. (See the main article for further details.)</p>
<p><a name="Physiological_differences_in_homosexual_persons" id="Physiological_differences_in_homosexual_persons"></a></p>
<h4>Physiological differences in homosexual persons</h4>
<p>Several recent studies, including pioneering work by neuroscientist <a href="/wiki/Simon_LeVay.html" title="Simon LeVay">Simon LeVay</a> demonstrate that there are notable differences between the physiology of a heterosexual male and a homosexual male. These differences are primarily noted in the <a href="/wiki/Brain.html" title="Brain">brain</a>, <a href="/wiki/Inner_ear.html" title="Inner ear">inner ear</a> and <a href="/wiki/Olfaction.html" title="Olfaction">olfactory</a> sense. LeVay discovered in his <a href="/wiki/Double-blind.html" title="Double-blind">double-blind</a> experiment that approximately 10% of homosexual male brains were physiologically different from their heterosexual counterparts, <sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a  title="">[5]</a></sup> some people take this as showing that people are born as homosexuals, however in LeVay's own words:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"It's important to stress what I didn't find. I did not prove that homosexuality was genetic, or find a genetic cause for being gay. I didn't show that gay men are born that way, the most common mistake people make in interpreting my work. Nor did I locate a gay center in the brain. INAH-3 is less likely to be the sole gay nucleus of the brain than a part of a chain of nuclei engaged in men and women's sexual behavior...Since I looked at adult brains we don't know if the differences I found were there at birth, or if they appeared later"<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a  title="">[6]</a></sup></dd>
</dl>
<p>LeVay's work has come under criticism for not taking into account the fact that all of the brains of homosexual men he studied were from homosexual men who had died of <a href="/wiki/AIDS.html" title="AIDS">AIDS</a>, which was not equally true of the heterosexuals whose brains he studied. When comparisons were made of the INAH-3 measurements in only the brains of those in each group who died from complications due to AIDS (albeit a small sample), similar size differences were found. It should also be noted that, to date, no evidence has been found to suggest that HIV or the effects of AIDS would results in changes in INAH-3 size.</p>
<p>Studies in women have not produced similar findings to date.</p>
<p>Some recent studies have tied a correlation between the number of older brothers a man has and his likelihood of being homosexual. Blanchard and Klassen (1997) <sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a  title="">[7]</a></sup> reported that each older brother increases the odds of being gay by 33%. This is now “one of the most reliable epidemiological variables ever identified in the study of sexual orientation” (Blanchard, 1997)<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a  title="">[8]</a></sup>. To explain this finding, it has been proposed that male fetuses provoke a maternal immune reaction that becomes stronger with each successive male fetus (Blanchard and Klassen, 1997). Male fetuses produce HY antigens which are “almost certainly” involved in the sexual differentiation of vertebrates (Blanchard and Klassen, 1997)<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a  title="">[9]</a></sup>. It is this antigen which maternal H-Y antibodies are proposed to both react to and ‘remember’. Successive male fetuses are then attacked by H-Y antibodies which somehow decrease the ability of H-Y antigens to perform their usual function in brain masculinisation. This is now known as the fraternal birth order effect. In a study comparing the effects of being raised with older "brothers" and having biological older brothers, published July 26, 2006 in PNAS, Bogaert found that there was a link to homosexuality only if the older brothers were biologically related and even when they were not raised together.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a  title="">[10]</a></sup> Interestingly, this relation seems to hold only for right-handed males.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a  title="">[11]</a></sup> There has been no observable equivalent for women.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the 20th century, early theoretical discussions in the field of <a href="/wiki/Psychoanalysis.html" title="Psychoanalysis">psychoanalysis</a> posited original <a href="/wiki/Bisexuality.html" title="Bisexuality">bisexuality</a> in human psychological development. Quantitative studies by <a href="/wiki/Alfred_Kinsey.html" title="Alfred Kinsey">Alfred Kinsey</a> in the 1940s and <a href="/wiki/Fritz_Klein.html" title="Fritz Klein">Dr. Fritz Klein</a>'s sexual orientation grid in the 1980s find distributions similar to those postulated by their predecessors.</p>
<p>Many modern studies, most notably <i>Sexual Behavior in the Human Male</i> <sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a  title="">[16]</a></sup> and <i>Sexual Behavior in the Human Female</i> <sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a  title="">[17]</a></sup> by <a href="/wiki/Alfred_Kinsey.html" title="Alfred Kinsey">Alfred Kinsey</a>, have found that the majority of humans have had homosexual experiences or sensations and are bisexual. Contemporary scientific research suggests that the majority of the human population is bisexual, adhering to a fluid sexual scale rather than a category, as Western society typically views sexual nature. The <a href="/wiki/Kinsey_Reports.html" title="Kinsey Reports">Kinsey Reports</a> found that approximately <a  class="external text" title="http://www.indiana.edu/~kinsey/publications/duberman.html">four percent</a> of adult Americans were exclusively homosexual for their entire lives, and approximately 10 percent were homosexual in their behaviour for some portion of their lives. Conversely, an even smaller minority of people appear to have had equal sexual experiences with both genders indicating an attraction scale or continuum. However, social pressures influence people to adhere to categories or labels rather than behave in a manner that more closely resembles their nature as suggested by this research.</p>
<p>Kinsey himself, along with current <a href="/wiki/Queer_Theory.html" title="Queer Theory">LGBT activist</a> groups, focus on the historicity and fluidity of sexual orientation. Kinsey's studies consistently found sexual orientation to be something that evolves in many directions over a person's lifetime; rarely, but not necessarily, including forming attractions to a new gender. Rarely do individuals radically reorient their sexualities rapidly — and still less do they do so volitionally — but often sexualities expand, shift, and absorb new elements over decades. For example, socially normative "age-appropriate" sexuality requires a shifting object of attraction (especially in the passage through adolescence). Contemporary <a href="/wiki/Queer_theory.html" title="Queer theory">queer theory</a>, incorporating many ideas from <a href="/wiki/Social_constructionism.html" title="Social constructionism">social constructionism</a>, tends to look at sexuality as something that has meaning only within a given historical framework. Sexuality, then, is seen as a participation in a larger social discourse, and, though in some sense fluid, not as something strictly determinable by the individual.</p>
<p>Most sexual orientation specialists follow the general conclusion of Alfred Kinsey regarding the sexual continuum, according to which a minority of humans are exclusively homosexual or <a href="/wiki/Heterosexuality.html" title="Heterosexuality">heterosexual</a>, and that the majority are <a href="/wiki/Bisexuality.html" title="Bisexuality">bisexual</a> <sup title="The text in the vicinity of this tag needs citation." class="noprint">[<a  title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><i>citation&#160;needed</i></a>]</sup>. The consensus of psychologists is that sexual orientation, in most individuals, is shaped at an early age; and is not voluntarily changeable.</p>
<p>Other studies have disputed Kinsey's methodology and have suggested that these reports overstated the occurrence of bisexuality and homosexuality in human populations. "His figures were undermined when it was revealed that he had disproportionately interviewed homosexuals and prisoners (many sex offenders)."<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a  title="">[18]</a></sup> <sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a  title="">[19]</a></sup></p>
<p>However, Kinsey's idea of a sexuality continuum still enjoys acceptance today and is supported by findings in the human and <a href="/wiki/Animal_kingdom.html" title="Animal kingdom">animal kingdoms</a> including biological studies of structural brain differences between those belonging to different sexual orientations.</p>
<p>More modern and precise research <i>Sex in America: A definitive survey</i> (1995) is now available from NORC and the University of Chicago by <a  class="new" title="Edward O. Laumann, University of Chicago">Edward O. Laumann, University of Chicago</a>. "Results reported from the study, and included in The Social organisation of sexuality, include those related to sexual practices and sexual relationships, number of partners, the rate of homosexuality in the population (which the study reported to be 1.3% for women within the past year, and 4.1% since 18 years; for men, 2.7% within the past year, and 4.9% since 18 years).</p>
<p>Sexologists have attributed discrepancies in some findings to negative societal attitudes towards homosexuality. For example, people may state different sexual orientations depending on whether their immediate social environment is public or private. Reluctance to disclose one's actual sexual orientation is often referred to as "being in the closet". Individuals capable of enjoyable sexual relations with both sexes may feel inclined to restrict themselves to heterosexual relations in societies that stigmatise same-sex relations.</p>
<p>Although the concept of three basic sexual orientations is widely recognised, a small minority maintain that there are other legitimate sexual orientations besides homosexuality, bisexuality and heterosexuality. These may include significant or exclusive orientation towards a particular type of transsexual or transgender individual (e.g. female-to-male transsexual men), intersexed individuals, or those who identify as non-gendered or other-gendered.</p>
<p><b>Father-son Relationships and Male Sexual Development</b></p>
<p>Investigation into parent-child relations of homosexual and heterosexual men is heavily documented in research literature, and a link between the absence of sufficient bonding with samesex parent or role models and the development of adult male homosexuality has been proposed. Numerous studies have found that adult homosexual males tend to report having had less loving and more rejecting fathers than their heterosexual peers (Bell, Weinberg, &amp; Parks, 1981; Bieber et al., 1962; Braatan &amp; Darling, 1965; Brown, 1963; Evans, 1969; Jonas, 1944; Millic &amp; Crowne, 1986; Nicolosi, 1991; Phelan, 1993; Saghir &amp; Robbins, 1973; Siegelman, 1974; Snortum, 1969; <a href="/wiki/Charles_Socarides.html" title="Charles Socarides">Socarides</a>, 1978; West, 1959).</p>
<p>Bieber (1976) stated:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Since 1962 when our volume was published, I have interviewed about 1,000 male homosexuals and 50 pairs of parents of homosexuals. The classic pattern was present in more than 90% of cases. In my entire experience, I have never interviewed a single male homosexual who had a constructive, loving father. A son who has a loving father who respects him does not become a homosexual.

<p>Bieber (1976) later expanded and clarified his earlier findings by saying:</p>
<dl>
<dd>We have repeatedly stated and written that a boy whose father is warmly related and constructive will not become homosexual; however, one must not get trapped by the fallacy of the converse, that is, a hostile, destructive father always produces a homosexual son</dd>
</dl>
<p>These reports have been criticized, particularly for confusing cause and effect. In other words, any tendency for gay males to bond more with their mothers than their fathers is more likely the result of homosexuality than the cause. The American Psychological Association has also criticized such reports, noting that the percentage of homosexuals is relatively constant across cultures, which is not what one would expect if parental influence were significant. The theory also fails to explain why homosexual acts were accepted among males in ancient Greece, pre-modern Japan, and other cultures, or why animals exhibit homosexuality. Animal biological research is beginning to parallel human research in its findings. The study of homosexual rams (Roselli et al. 2004 cited in LeVay, 2006) <sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a  title="">[20]</a></sup> revealed that in homosexual rams, the analogous brain structure indicated to be involved in human homosexuality showed similar size differences to those in humans.</p>

<p>Some therapists, institutions, and groups contend they are able to assist homosexuals to overcome their homosexual tendencies.

<p>Considerable debate exists over whether predominantly biological or psychological factors produce sexual orientation in humans. Candidate factors include <a href="/wiki/Biology_and_sexual_orientation#Empirical_studies.html" title="Biology and sexual orientation">genes</a> and the exposure of fetuses to certain <a href="/wiki/Biology_and_sexual_orientation#Early_fixation_hypothesis.html" title="Biology and sexual orientation">hormones</a> (or lack thereof). Historically, Freud and many others psychologists, particularly in psychoanalytic or developmental traditions, speculated that formative childhood experiences help produced sexual orientation; as an example Freud believed that all human teenagers are predominantly homosexual and transition to heterosexuality in adulthood; those who remain homosexual as adults he believed had experienced some traumatic event that arrested their sexual development; however, he did believe all adults, even those who had healthy sexual development still retained latent homosexuality to varying degrees. Although there is currently no general medical consensus, one theory is that biological factors — whether genetic or acquired <i>in utero</i> — produce characteristically homosexual childhood experiences (such as atypical gender behaviour experiences), or at the least significantly contribute to them.</p>

<p>Most nations do not impede consensual sex between unrelated individuals above the local <a href="/wiki/Age_of_consent.html" title="Age of consent">age of consent</a>.

<p>Many people who feel attracted to members of their own sex have a so-called coming out at some point in their lives. Generally, coming out is described in two phases. The first phase is the phase of "knowing oneself," and the realization or decision emerges that one is open to same-sex love. This is often described as an internal coming out. The second phase involves one's decision to come out to others, e.g. family, friends, and/or colleagues. This occurs with many people as early as age 11, but others do not clarify their sexual orientation until age 40 or older. Most have their coming out during school age, so sometime during the time of puberty. At this age, they may not trust or ask for help from others, especially when their orientation is not accepted in society. Sometimes their own parents are not even informed. Coming out can sometimes lead to a life crisis, which can elevate to suicidal thoughts or even committing suicide. Crisis centers in larger cities and information sites on the Internet can help these people to accept their homosexuality. In fact, the suicide rate is notably higher with pubescent homosexuals than their heterosexual peers.</p>

<p>In most developed countries, same-sex relationships are accepted, and are accorded legal protection. Many governments have established formal structures for confirming legal relationships (either as marriage or partnership) between people of the same sex.</p>

<p>For example, the Supreme Court of Canada, citing the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, has established the legality of same-sex marriage on the basis of human rights. Some people argue for social acceptance of same-sex relationships on the basis that homosexuals were born homosexual, but it is difficult for some people to change their moral stance on homosexuality. Some religious groups fear the <a href="/wiki/Slippery_slope.html" title="Slippery slope">slippery slope</a> that same-sex tolerance is a step toward tolerance of other currently unaccepted practices such as polygamy and incest. Many people in religious groups recognize other people's rights to choose a same-sex relationship, but also believe that same-sex relationships are incompatible with their chosen religious practices. They often attempt to use other state-sanctioned punitive measures to discourage homosexuality, short of death or imprisonment. This includes attempts to rescind domestic partnership benefits through anti-gay-marriage initiatives with broad language.</p>

<p>Sexual customs have varied greatly over time and from one region to another. These, as well as the orientation of particular pre-contemporary figures continue to be studied. Modern Western gay culture, largely a product of 19th century <a href="/wiki/Psychology.html" title="Psychology">psychology</a> as well as the years of post-<a href="/wiki/Stonewall_riots.html" title="Stonewall riots">Stonewall</a> <a href="/wiki/Gay_Liberation.html" title="Gay Liberation">Gay Liberation</a>, is a relatively recent manifestation of same-sex desire. It is generally not applicable as a standard when investigating same-gender sex and historical opinions and beliefs held by other people.</p>
<p>It is generally accepted that the lives of historical figures such as <a href="/wiki/Socrates.html" title="Socrates">Socrates</a>, <a href="/wiki/George_Gordon_Byron%2C_6th_Baron_Byron.html" title="George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron">Lord Byron</a>, <a href="/wiki/Edward_II_of_England.html" title="Edward II of England">Edward II</a>, <a href="/wiki/Hadrian.html" title="Hadrian">Hadrian</a>, <a href="/wiki/Julius_Caesar.html" title="Julius Caesar">Julius Caesar</a>, <a href="/wiki/Michelangelo.html" title="Michelangelo">Michelangelo</a>, <a href="/wiki/Donatello.html" title="Donatello">Donatello</a> and <a href="/wiki/Christopher_Marlowe.html" title="Christopher Marlowe">Christopher Marlowe</a> included or were centred upon love and sexual relationships with people of their own gender. Terms such as <i>gay</i> or <i>bisexual</i> have been applied to them, but many regard this as risking the anachronistic introduction of a contemporary <a href="/wiki/Social_construction.html" title="Social construction">construction</a> of sexuality foreign to their times.<sup title="The text in the vicinity of this tag needs citation." class="noprint">[<a  title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><i>citation&#160;needed</i></a>]</sup> Variations from modern standards of beauty, social roles, sexual positions, and age disparities are of such magnitude so as to render meaningless any projection of modern roles onto historical personages. This does not mean, however, that people in the past experienced the physical phenomenon of homosexual attraction any differently than people experience it today.</p>
<p>While some premodern societies did not employ categories fully comparable to the modern homosexual or heterosexual dichotomy, this does not demonstrate that the polarity is not applicable to those societies. A common thread of constructionist argument is that no one in antiquity or the Middle Ages experienced homosexuality as an exclusive, permanent, or defining mode of sexuality. John Boswell has criticised this argument by citing ancient Greek writings by Plato, which he says indicate knowledge of exclusive homosexuality.<sup title="The text in the vicinity of this tag needs citation." class="noprint">[<a  title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><i>citation&#160;needed</i></a>]</sup><a href="/wiki/Michel_Foucault.html" title="Michel Foucault">Michel Foucault</a> and historians following his line of thought have argued that the <i>homosexual</i> is a modern invention, a social construct of the last 100 years.<sup title="The text in the vicinity of this tag needs citation." class="noprint">[<a  title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><i>citation&#160;needed</i></a>]</sup> While true of homosexuality as a <i>scientific</i> or <i>psychological</i> category, there are examples from earlier ages of those viewing their sexuality as a part of a human identity and not merely a sexual act. <sup title="The text in the vicinity of this tag needs citation." class="noprint">[<a  title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><i>citation&#160;needed</i></a>]</sup> One cited example is the 16th century Italian artist <a href="/wiki/Il_Sodoma.html" title="Il Sodoma">Giovanni Antonio Bazzi</a> who adopted the nickname "Sodoma", which is viewed by Louis Crompton as something analogous to the modern gay identity.<sup title="The text in the vicinity of this tag needs citation." class="noprint">[<a  title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><i>citation&#160;needed</i></a>]</sup></p>

<p>In North American Native society, the most common form of same-sex sexuality seems to centre around the figure of the <a href="/wiki/Two-Spirit.html" title="Two-Spirit">Two-Spirit</a> individual. Such persons seem to have been recognised by the majority of tribes, each of which had its particular term for the role. Typically the two-spirit individual was recognised early in life, was given a choice by the parents to follow the path, and if the child accepted the role then the child was raised in the appropriate manner, learning the customs of the gender it had chosen. Two-spirit individuals were commonly <a href="/wiki/Shamanism.html" title="Shamanism">shamans</a> and were revered as having powers beyond those of ordinary shamans. Their sexual life would be with the ordinary tribe members of the opposite gender. Male two-spirit people were prized as wives because of their greater strength and ability to work.</p>

<h3>East Asia</h3>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/Asia.html" title="Asia">Asia</a> same-sex love has been known since the dawn of history. Early Western travellers were taken aback by its widespread acceptance and open display.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Homosexuality_in_China.html" title="Homosexuality in China">Homosexuality in China</a>, known as the <i>pleasures of the bitten peach,</i> <i>the cut sleeve,</i> or <i>the southern custom,</i> have been recorded since approximately 600 BCE. These euphemistic terms were used to describe behaviours, but not identities. The relationships were marked by differences in age and social position. However, the instances of same-sex affection and sexual interactions described in the <i><a href="/wiki/Cao_Xueqin.html" title="Cao Xueqin">Hong Lou Meng</a></i> (<i>Dream of the Red Chamber,</i> or <i>Story of the Stone</i>) seem as familiar to observers in the present as do equivalent stories of romances between heterosexuals during the same period.</p>

<p>The earliest western documents (in the form of literary works, art objects, as well as <a href="/wiki/Greek_mythology.html" title="Greek mythology">mythographic materials</a>) concerning same-sex relationships are derived from <a href="/wiki/Ancient_Greece.html" title="Ancient Greece">Ancient Greece</a>. They depict a world in which relationships with women and relationships with youths were the essential foundation of a normal man's love life. Same-sex relationships were a social institution variously constructed over time and from one city to another. (See <a href="/wiki/Pederasty.html" title="Pederasty">Pederasty</a>) The practice, a system of relationships between an adult male and an adolescent coming of age, was often valued for its pedagogic benefits and as a means of population control, and occasionally blamed for causing disorder. <a href="/wiki/Plato.html" title="Plato">Plato</a> praised its benefits in his early writings, but in his late works proposed its prohibition, laying out a strategy which uncannily predicts the path by which same-sex love was eventually driven underground. <i>(See <a href="/wiki/Philosophy_of_Greek_pederasty.html" title="Philosophy of Greek pederasty">Philosophy of Greek pederasty</a>)</i></p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Roman_Empire.html" title="Roman Empire">Roman emperor</a> <a href="/wiki/Hadrian.html" title="Hadrian">Hadrian</a> (pagan) allegedly was a fully practicing gay himself.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Roman_Empire.html" title="Roman Empire">Roman</a> (Christian) emperor <a href="/wiki/Theodosius_I.html" title="Theodosius I">Theodosius I</a> decreed a law, on August 6th, 390, condemning passive homosexuals to be burned at the stake. <a href="/wiki/Justinian_I.html" title="Justinian I">Justinian</a>, towards the end of his reign, expanded the proscription to the active partner as well (in 558) warning that such conduct can lead to the destruction of cities through the "wrath of God." Notwithstanding these regulations, taxes on homosexual boy <a href="/wiki/Brothels.html" title="Brothels">brothels</a> continued to be collected until the end of the reign of <a href="/wiki/Anastasius_I_%28emperor%29.html" title="Anastasius I (emperor)">Anastasius I</a> in 518.</p>
<p>During the <a href="/wiki/Renaissance.html" title="Renaissance">Renaissance</a>, rich cities in northern Italy, <a href="/wiki/Florence.html" title="Florence">Florence</a> and <a href="/wiki/Venice.html" title="Venice">Venice</a> in particular, were renowned for their widespread practice of same-sex love, engaged in by a considerable part of the male (elite) population and constructed along the classical pattern of Greece and Rome. <sup id="_ref-27" class="reference"><a  title="">[29]</a></sup> <sup id="_ref-28" class="reference"><a  title="">[30]</a></sup> But even as the majority of the male population was engaging in same-sex relationships, the authorities, under the aegis of the <a href="/wiki/Officers_of_the_Night.html" title="Officers of the Night">Officers of the Night</a> court, were prosecuting, fining, and imprisoning a good portion of that population. The eclipse of this period of relative artistic and erotic freedom was precipitated by the rise to power of the moralising monk <a href="/wiki/Girolamo_Savonarola.html" title="Girolamo Savonarola">Girolamo Savonarola</a>. In northern Europe the artistic discourse on sodomy was turned against its proponents by artists such as <a href="/wiki/Rembrandt_Harmenszoon_van_Rijn.html" title="Rembrandt Harmenszoon van Rijn">Rembrandt</a>, who in his <a href="/wiki/Ganymede_%28mythology%29#Renaissance_and_Baroque_Ganymede.html" title="Ganymede (mythology)">"Rape of Ganymede"</a> no longer depicted <a href="/wiki/Ganymede_%28mythology%29.html" title="Ganymede (mythology)">Ganymede</a> as a willing youth, but as a squalling baby attacked by a rapacious bird of prey.</p>
<p>The relationships of socially prominent figures, such as King James I and the Duke of Buckingham, served to highlight the issue, including in anonymously authored street pamphlets: "The world is chang'd I know not how, For men Kiss Men, not Women now;...Of J. the First and Buckingham: He, true it is, his Wives Embraces fled, To slabber his lov'd Ganimede;" (<i>Mundus Foppensis, or The Fop Display'd</i>, 1691.)</p>
<p>1723 in England saw publication of <i>Love Letters Between a Certain Late Nobleman and the famous Mr Wilson.</i>, which some modern scholars presume to be a novel. The 1749 edition of <a href="/wiki/John_Cleland.html" title="John Cleland">John Cleland</a>'s popular novel <a href="/wiki/Fanny_Hill.html" title="Fanny Hill">Fanny Hill</a> includes a homosexual scene, but this was removed in its 1750 edition. Also in 1749 the earliest extended and serious defence of homosexuality in English <i>Ancient and Modern Pederasty Investigated and Exemplified</i>, written by <a  class="new" title="Thomas Cannon">Thomas Cannon</a>, was published, but was suppressed almost immediately. It includes the passage: ""Unnatural Desire is a Contradiction in Terms; downright Nonsense. Desire is an amatory Impulse of the inmost human Parts." <sup id="_ref-29" class="reference"><a  title="">[31]</a></sup> Around 1785 <a href="/wiki/Jeremy_Bentham.html" title="Jeremy Bentham">Jeremy Bentham</a> wrote another long defence, but this was not published until 1978. <sup id="_ref-30" class="reference"><a  title="">[32]</a></sup>Executions for sodomy continued in the Netherlands until 1803, and in England until 1835.</p>
<p>Between 1864 and 1880 <a href="/wiki/Karl_Heinrich_Ulrichs.html" title="Karl Heinrich Ulrichs">Karl Heinrich Ulrichs</a> published a series of twelve tracts, which he collectively titled <i>Research on the Riddle of Man-Manly Love.</i> In 1867 he became the first self-proclaimed homosexual to speak out publicly in defence of homosexuality when he pleaded at the Congress of German Jurists in Munich for a resolution urging the repeal of anti-homosexual laws.</p>
<p>Sir <a href="/wiki/Richard_Francis_Burton.html" title="Richard Francis Burton">Richard Francis Burton</a>'s <i>Terminal Essay, Part IV/D</i> appendix in his translation of <i>The Book of the Thousand Nights and a Night</i> (1885-6) provided an effusive overview of homosexuality in the middle east and tropics. <i>Sexual Inversion</i> by <a href="/wiki/Havelock_Ellis.html" title="Havelock Ellis">Havelock Ellis</a>, published in 1896 challenged theories that homosexuality was abnormal, as well as stereotypes, and insisted on the ubiquity of homosexuality and its association with intellectual and artistic achievement. Appendix A included <i>A Problem in Greek Ethics</i> by <a href="/wiki/John_Addington_Symonds.html" title="John Addington Symonds">John Addington Symonds</a>, which had been privately distributed in 1883. Beginning in 1894 with <i>Homogenic Love</i>, Socialist activist and poet <a href="/wiki/Edward_Carpenter.html" title="Edward Carpenter">Edward Carpenter</a> wrote a string of pro-homosexual articles and pamphlets, and 'came out' in 1916 in his book <i>My Days and Dreams</i>.</p>

<p>Among many <a href="/wiki/Middle_East.html" title="Middle East">Middle-Eastern</a> Muslim cultures, homosexual practices were widespread and public. Persian poets, such as <a href="/wiki/Attar.html" title="Attar">Attar</a> (d. 1220), <a href="/wiki/Jalal_ad-Din_Muhammad_Rumi.html" title="Jalal ad-Din Muhammad Rumi">Rumi</a> (d. 1273), <a href="/wiki/Saadi.html" title="Saadi">Sa’di</a> (d. 1291), <a href="/wiki/Hafez.html" title="Hafez">Hafez</a> (d. 1389), and <a href="/wiki/Jami.html" title="Jami">Jami</a> (d. 1492), wrote poems replete with homoerotic allusions. Recent work in <a href="/wiki/Queer_studies.html" title="Queer studies">queer studies</a> suggests that while the visibility of such relationships has been much reduced, their frequency has not. The two most commonly documented forms were commercial sex with <a href="/wiki/Transgender.html" title="Transgender">transgender</a> males or males enacting transgender roles exemplified by the <a href="/wiki/K%C3%B6%C3%A7ek.html" title="Köçek">köçeks</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Bacch%C3%A1.html" title="Bacchá">bacchás</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Sufi.html" title="Sufi">Sufi</a> spiritual practices in which the practitioner crossed over from the idealised chaste form of the practice to one in which the desire is consummated.</p>
<p>In Persia homosexuality and homoerotic expressions were tolerated in numerous public places, from monasteries and seminaries to taverns, military camps, bathhouses, and coffee houses. In the early <a href="/wiki/Safavids.html" title="Safavids">Safavid</a> era (1501-1723), male houses of prostitution (<i>amrad khane</i>) were legally recognized and paid taxes.</p>
<p>A rich tradition of art and literature sprang up, constructing Middle Eastern homosexuality in ways analogous to the ancient tradition of male love in which <a href="/wiki/Ganymede_%28mythology%29.html" title="Ganymede (mythology)">Ganymede</a>, cup-bearer to the gods, symbolised the ideal boyfriend. Muslim — often <a href="/wiki/Sufi.html" title="Sufi">Sufi</a> — poets in medieval <a href="/wiki/Arab.html" title="Arab">Arab</a> lands and in <a href="/wiki/Iran.html" title="Iran">Persia</a> wrote odes to the beautiful Christian wine boys who, they claimed, served them in the taverns and shared their beds at night. In many areas the practice survived into modern times (as documented by <a href="/wiki/Richard_Francis_Burton.html" title="Richard Francis Burton">Richard Francis Burton</a>, <a href="/wiki/Andr%C3%A9_Gide.html" title="André Gide">André Gide</a>, and others).</p>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/Central_Asia.html" title="Central Asia">Central Asia</a>, on the <a href="/wiki/Silk_Route.html" title="Silk Route">Silk Route</a>, the two traditions of the east and the west met, and gave rise to a strong local culture of same-sex love. In the <a href="/wiki/Turkic_languages.html" title="Turkic languages">Turkic</a>-speaking areas, one manifestation of this were the <a href="/wiki/Bacch%C3%A1.html" title="Bacchá">bacchá</a>, adolescent or adolescent-seeming male entertainers and sex workers. In other areas male love continues to surface despite efforts to keep it quiet. After the American invasion of Afghanistan, Central Asian same-sex love customs in which adult men take on adolescent lovers were widely reported.</p>
<p>Other forms are less well documented. It is reported that in the Oasis of <a href="/wiki/Siwa.html" title="Siwa">Siwa</a>, boy marriages were the norm until the middle of the twentieth century, a practice which was coupled with a minimum age for heterosexual marriage of forty for the men, a measure presumed to have been taken to avoid overpopulation. Finally, sexual relations between older and younger boys are said to be frequent in the Middle East as well as in the <a href="/wiki/Maghreb.html" title="Maghreb">Maghreb</a>.</p>
<p>The prevailing pattern of same-sex relationships in the temperate and sub-tropical zone stretching from Northern India to the Western Sahara is one in which the relationships were — and are — either gender-structured or age-structured or both. In recent years, egalitarian relationships modelled on the western pattern have become more frequent, though they remain rare.</p>

<p>In many societies of <a href="/wiki/Melanesia.html" title="Melanesia">Melanesia</a> same-sex relationships are an integral part of the culture. Traditional <a href="/wiki/Melanesia.html" title="Melanesia">Melanesian</a> insemination rituals also existed where a boy, upon reaching a certain age would be paired with an older adolescent who would become his mentor and whom he would ritually fellate over a number of years in order to develop his own masculinity. In certain tribes of <a href="/wiki/Papua_New_Guinea.html" title="Papua New Guinea">Papua New Guinea</a>, for example, it is considered a normal ritual responsibility for a boy to have a relationship in order to accomplish his ascent into manhood.

<p>Since the 1960s, in part due to their history of shared oppression, many gays in the West have developed a shared <a href="/wiki/Queer_culture.html" title="Queer culture">culture</a>. Not all gays choose to participate in it, and many gay men and women specifically decline to do so. To many gay men and women, the gay culture represents <a href="/wiki/Heterophobia.html" title="Heterophobia">heterophobia</a> and is scorned as widening the gulf between gay and straight people. Some people believe that gay culture is exemplified by the <a href="/wiki/Gay_pride.html" title="Gay pride">gay pride</a> movement. In the past, some gay groups organised campaigns for awareness of the <a href="/wiki/AIDS.html" title="AIDS">AIDS</a> outbreak.</p>

<h4>Marriage and Civil Unions</h4>
<p>Legislation designed to create provisions for gay marriage in a number of countries has polarised international opinion and led to many well-publicized political debates and court battles in a number of countries. In 2006 the <a href="/wiki/Netherlands.html" title="Netherlands">Netherlands</a>, <a href="/wiki/Belgium.html" title="Belgium">Belgium</a>, <a href="/wiki/Spain.html" title="Spain">Spain</a>, <a href="/wiki/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canada</a> and <a href="/wiki/South_Africa.html" title="South Africa">South Africa</a> had legalized <a href="/wiki/Same-sex_marriage.html" title="Same-sex marriage">same-sex marriage</a>. Regarding <a href="/wiki/Same-sex_marriage_in_the_United_States.html" title="Same-sex marriage in the United States">same-sex marriage in the United States</a>, only the <a href="/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Massachusetts.html" title="Commonwealth of Massachusetts">Commonwealth of Massachusetts</a> has legalized gay marriage while the States of Vermont and Connecticut allow <a href="/wiki/Civil_unions.html" title="Civil unions">civil unions</a> <sup id="_ref-31" class="reference"><a  title="">[33]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Other countries, including the majority of <a href="/wiki/Europe.html" title="Europe">European</a> nations, have enacted laws allowing <a href="/wiki/Civil_unions.html" title="Civil unions">civil unions</a>, designed to give gay couples similar rights as married couples concerning legal issues such as inheritance and immigration. Numerous <a href="/wiki/Scandinavia.html" title="Scandinavia">Scandinavian</a> countries have had domestic partnership laws on the books since the late 1980s. In the United States, the framing of the debate around marriage rather than civil unions may have been partly responsible for the defeat of a number of measures by sparking opposition from many conservative and religious groups. For example, in California, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger stated that he supports full legal protection for gay couples - but that the issue of gay marriage is best decided by the people or in the courts <sup id="_ref-32" class="reference"><a  title="">[34]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>In Asia, the conflict between homoerotic tradition and a resurgent Islamic fundamentalism continues. Liaquat Ali, a 42 year old <a href="/wiki/Afghanistan.html" title="Afghanistan">Afghan</a> refugee, and Markeen Afridi a 16 year old <a href="/wiki/Pakistan.html" title="Pakistan">Pakistani</a> boy, reportedly fell in love and got married in a very public ceremony in October of 2005. <sup id="_ref-33" class="reference"><a  title="">[35]</a></sup> <sup id="_ref-34" class="reference"><a  title="">[36]</a></sup> There are efforts to refute the original reports which were authored by a reporter from the tribe where the wedding occurred. <sup id="_ref-35" class="reference"><a  title="">[37]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>For many traditionalists, and in the light of unfavorable views by certain religions, objections have been raised, e.g. arguing that marriage is a specific institution designed as a foundation for parenthood, which an infertile union cannot qualify for. The <a href="/wiki/American_Psychological_Association.html" title="American Psychological Association">American Psychological Association</a> has largely discredited such arguments (C. Patterson, 1995) and found that the majority of unbiased academic studies of gay and lesbian parents contradict these beliefs.</p>

<p><a href="/wiki/Adoption_by_same-sex_couples.html" title="Adoption by same-sex couples">Adoption by same-sex couples</a> remains a contentious issue in many countries, and part of the platform of many gay rights organizations.</p>
<p><a name="Political_developments" id="Political_developments"></a></p>
<h4>Political developments</h4>
<p>Publicly gay politicians have attained numerous government posts, even in countries that had <a href="/wiki/Sodomy_law.html" title="Sodomy law">sodomy laws</a> or outright <a href="/wiki/History_of_gays_in_Nazi_Germany_and_the_Holocaust.html" title="History of gays in Nazi Germany and the Holocaust">mass murder of gays</a> in their recent past.</p>
<p>Gay British politicians include former UK <a href="/wiki/Cabinet.html" title="Cabinet">Cabinet ministers</a> <a href="/wiki/Chris_Smith.html" title="Chris Smith">Chris Smith</a> (now Lord Smith of Finsbury who is also a rare example of an openly HIV positive statesman) and <a href="/wiki/Nick_Brown.html" title="Nick Brown">Nick Brown</a>, and, most famously, <a href="/wiki/Peter_Mandelson.html" title="Peter Mandelson">Peter Mandelson</a>, a <a href="/wiki/European_Commission.html" title="European Commission">European Commissioner</a> and close friend of Tony Blair. Openly gay Per-Kristian Foss was the Norwegian minister of finance until September of 2005.</p>
<p><a name="Religious_developments" id="Religious_developments"></a></p>
<h4>Religious developments</h4>
<p>The overall trend of greater acceptance of gay men and women in the latter part of the 20th century was not limited to <a href="/wiki/Secular.html" title="Secular">secular</a> institutions; it was also seen in many <a href="/wiki/Religion_and_homosexuality.html" title="Religion and homosexuality">religious</a> institutions. <a href="/wiki/Reform_Judaism.html" title="Reform Judaism">Reform Judaism</a>, the largest branch of <a href="/wiki/Judaism.html" title="Judaism">Judaism</a> outside <a href="/wiki/Israel.html" title="Israel">Israel</a> had begun to facilitate religious <a href="/wiki/Same-sex_marriages.html" title="Same-sex marriages">weddings</a> for gay adherents in their synagogues. The <a href="/wiki/Anglican_Communion.html" title="Anglican Communion">Anglican Communion</a> encountered discord that caused a rift between the African and Asian Anglican churches on the one hand and North American churches on the other when American and Canadian churches ordained gay clergy and began blessing same-sex unions. Other Churches such as the <a href="/wiki/Methodist_Church.html" title="Methodist Church">Methodist Church</a> had experienced trials of gay clergy who some claimed were a violation of religious principles resulting in mixed verdicts dependent on geography.</p>
<p>These developments have been accompanied by a response from certain conservative religious organisations, especially in the United States. In various instances, this movement has succeeded in overturning some of the aforementioned legislation and has had an influence on academia. In late 2005, Haworth Press withdrew from publication a volume on homosexuality in classical antiquity titled <i>Same-Sex Desire and Love in Greco-Roman Antiquity and in the Classical Tradition of the West.</i> This was in response to criticism from American conservative groups which objected to the discussion of positive aspects of classical pederasty, as well as to a chapter by the American academic Bruce Rind which was branded by the critics as advocating pedophilia. <i>(see <a href="/wiki/Anti-gay_slogan.html" title="Anti-gay slogan">Anti-gay slogan</a>)</i> The publisher, in a letter to the editors, exonerated Rind from the accusation and conceded that his article was sound, but stood by its decision to withdraw it "to avoid negative press" and "economic repercussions." <a  class="external text" title="http://thechronicleherald.ca/NovaScotia/456746.html">Article in the Halifax <i>The Chronicle Herald</i></a></p>
<p>Fundamentalist religious organizations are also attempting to weaken the gay rights community by cutting off its sources of income. In spring of 2005, the "American Family Association" threatened a boycott of <a href="/wiki/Ford_Motor_Company.html" title="Ford Motor Company">Ford</a> products to protest Ford's perceived support of "the homosexual agenda and homosexual marriage." After meeting with representatives of the group, Ford announced it was curtailing ads in a number of major gay publications (thus depriving them of a major source of income), an action it claimed to be determined not by cultural but by "cost-cutting" factors. That statement was contradicted by the AFA, which claimed it had a "good faith agreement" that Ford would cease such ads. Soon afterwards, as a result of a strong upcry from the gay community, Ford backtracked and announced it would continue ads in gay publications, in response to which the AFA denounced Ford for "violating" the agreement, and renewed threats of a boycott. <a  class="external text" title="http://www.consumeraffairs.com/news04/2005/ford_gay_ads04.html">Anti-Gay Group Renews Ford Boycott Threat</a></p>
<p>Whether or not <i>sexual orientation</i> (in the sense of an underlying same-sex, opposite-sex, dual-sex, or other spontaneous attraction) exists, and whether or not it can be changed is a matter of some controversy. See <a href="/wiki/Sexual_orientation.html" title="Sexual orientation">Sexual orientation</a>, <a href="/wiki/Environment%2C_choice%2C_and_sexual_orientation.html" title="Environment, choice, and sexual orientation">Environment, choice, and sexual orientation</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ex-gay.html" title="Ex-gay">Ex-gay</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Genetics_and_sexual_orientation.html" title="Genetics and sexual orientation">Genetics and sexual orientation</a>.

<p>One of the main ways in which the record of same-sex love has been preserved is through <a href="/wiki/Literature.html" title="Literature">literature</a> and <a href="/wiki/Art.html" title="Art">art</a>. Typically through history, male homoeroticism has been the work of gay male artists, while lesbian eroticism has more often been the work of heterosexual men, although exceptions exist, especially in poetry and fiction.</p>
<p>Male homoerotic sensibilities are visible in the foundations of art in the west, to the extent that those roots can be traced back to the <a href="/wiki/Ancient_Greeks.html" title="Ancient Greeks">ancient Greeks</a>. <a href="/wiki/Homer.html" title="Homer">Homer</a>'s <i><a href="/wiki/Iliad.html" title="Iliad">Iliad</a></i> is considered to have the love between two men as its central feature, a view held since antiquity. <a href="/wiki/Plato.html" title="Plato">Plato</a>'s <a href="/wiki/Symposium.html" title="Symposium">Symposium</a> also gives readers commentary on the subject, at one point putting forth the claim that male homosexual love is superior to heterosexual love.</p>
<p>The European tradition of homoeroticism was continued throughout the ages in the works of <a href="/wiki/Leonardo_da_Vinci.html" title="Leonardo da Vinci">Leonardo da Vinci</a> and <a href="/wiki/Michelangelo.html" title="Michelangelo">Michelangelo</a>. Since the Renaissance, both male and female homoeroticism has remained a common theme in the visual arts of the west.</p>
<p>In Islamic societies homoeroticism was present in the work of such writers as <a href="/wiki/Abu_Nuwas.html" title="Abu Nuwas">Abu Nuwas</a> and <a href="/wiki/Omar_Khayyam.html" title="Omar Khayyam">Omar Khayyam</a>. <i><a href="/wiki/The_Tale_of_Genji.html" title="The Tale of Genji">The Tale of Genji</a></i>, called the "world's first real novel", fostered this tradition in <a href="/wiki/Japan.html" title="Japan">Japan</a>, as did the Chinese literary tradition in works such as <a href="/wiki/Homosexuality_in_China#Same-sex_love_in_literature.html" title="Homosexuality in China">Bian er Zhai</a> and <a href="/wiki/Homosexuality_in_China#Same-sex_love_in_literature.html" title="Homosexuality in China">Jin Ping Mei</a>. Today, the Japanese <a href="/wiki/Anime.html" title="Anime">anime</a> subgenre <a href="/wiki/Yaoi.html" title="Yaoi">yaoi</a> centers on male homosexuality. Japan is unusual in that the culture's male homoerotic art has typically been the work of female artists, mirroring the case of lesbian eroticism in western art.</p>
<p>In the twentieth century, entertainers such as <a href="/wiki/Noel_Coward.html" title="Noel Coward">Noel Coward</a>, <a href="/wiki/Madonna_%28entertainer%29.html" title="Madonna (entertainer)">Madonna</a>, <a href="/wiki/Kd_lang.html" title="Kd lang">kd lang</a>, and <a href="/wiki/David_Bowie.html" title="David Bowie">David Bowie</a> have brought homoeroticism into the field of western popular music. It is through these and other modern songwriters and poets that art by lesbians, rather than erotic art by men with lesbian themes, has had its greatest cultural impact in the West since the ancient Greek poet <a href="/wiki/Sappho.html" title="Sappho">Sappho</a>.</p>
<p>In the 1990s, a number of American television comedies began to feature gay and lesbian characters. The <a href="/wiki/1997_in_television.html" title="1997 in television">1997</a> <a href="/wiki/Coming_out.html" title="Coming out">coming-out</a> of comedian <a href="/wiki/Ellen_Degeneres.html" title="Ellen Degeneres">Ellen Degeneres</a> on her show <i><a href="/wiki/Ellen_%28TV_series%29.html" title="Ellen (TV series)">Ellen</a></i> was front-page news in America and brought the show its highest ratings. However, public interest in the show swiftly declined after this, and the show was cancelled after one more season. Immediately afterward <i><a href="/wiki/Will_%26_Grace.html" title="Will &amp; Grace">Will &amp; Grace</a></i>, which ran from <a href="/wiki/1998_in_television.html" title="1998 in television">1998</a> to <a href="/wiki/2005_in_television.html" title="2005 in television">2005</a> on <a href="/wiki/NBC.html" title="NBC">NBC</a>, became the most successful series to focus on homosexuality.</p>
<p>Playwrights have penned such popular homoerotic works as <a href="/wiki/Tennesse_Williams.html" title="Tennesse Williams">Tennesse Williams</a>'s <i><a href="/wiki/Cat_on_a_Hot_Tin_Roof.html" title="Cat on a Hot Tin Roof">Cat on a Hot Tin Roof</a></i> and <a href="/wiki/Tony_Kushner.html" title="Tony Kushner">Tony Kushner</a>'s <i><a  title="Angels in America: A Gay Fantasia on National Themes">Angels In America</a></i>. Homosexuality has also been a frequent theme in <a href="/wiki/Broadway_theatre.html" title="Broadway theatre">Broadway</a> musicals, such as <i><a href="/wiki/A_Chorus_Line.html" title="A Chorus Line">A Chorus Line</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Rent_%28musical%29.html" title="Rent (musical)">Rent</a></i>. In <a href="/wiki/2005_in_film.html" title="2005 in film">2005</a>, the gay romantic film <i><a href="/wiki/Brokeback_Mountain.html" title="Brokeback Mountain">Brokeback Mountain</a></i> was a financial and critical success internationally. Unlike most gay film characters, both the film's lovers were "<a href="/wiki/Butch_and_femme.html" title="Butch and femme">butch</a>." The movie's success was considered a milestone in the public acceptance of the <a href="/wiki/Gay_rights_in_the_United_States.html" title="Gay rights in the United States">American gay rights movement</a>.</p>
