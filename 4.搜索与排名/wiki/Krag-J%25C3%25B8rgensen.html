<p>The <b>Krag-Jørgensen</b> is a <a href="/wiki/Repeating_rifle.html" title="Repeating rifle">repeating</a> <a href="/wiki/Bolt_action.html" title="Bolt action">bolt action</a> <a href="/wiki/Rifle.html" title="Rifle">rifle</a> designed by the <a href="/wiki/Norway.html" title="Norway">Norwegians</a> <a href="/wiki/Ole_Herman_Johannes_Krag.html" title="Ole Herman Johannes Krag">Ole Herman Johannes Krag</a> and <a href="/wiki/Erik_J%C3%B8rgensen.html" title="Erik Jørgensen">Erik Jørgensen</a> in the late 19th century. It was adopted as a standard arm by <a href="/wiki/Denmark.html" title="Denmark">Denmark</a>, the <a href="/wiki/United_States.html" title="United States">United States</a> and <a href="/wiki/Norway.html" title="Norway">Norway</a>.</p>
<p>A distinctive feature of the Krag-Jørgensen action was its <a href="/wiki/Magazine_%28firearm%29.html" title="Magazine (firearm)">magazine</a>. While many other rifles of its era used an integral box magazine, the magazine of the Krag-Jørgensen was integral with the <a href="/wiki/Receiver_%28firearms%29.html" title="Receiver (firearms)">receiver</a> (the part of the rifle that houses the operating parts), featuring an opening on the right hand side with a hinged cover. The <a href="/wiki/Cartridge_%28weaponry%29.html" title="Cartridge (weaponry)">cartridges</a> were inserted through the side opening, and were pushed up, around, and into the action by a spring follower.</p>
<p>This presented both advantages and disadvantages compared with a top-loading "box" magazine, which were often fed using a "<a href="/wiki/Stripper_clip.html" title="Stripper clip">stripper clip</a>". While a similar claw type clip would be made that could allow the magazine to be loaded all at once, normal loading was one cartridge at a time. However, the design was easy to "top off", and unlike most other top-loading magazines, the Krag-Jørgensen's magazine could be topped up without opening the rifle's bolt. The relative complexity of manufacturing this magazine has been suggested as a reason why many countries did not adopt the Krag-Jørgensen. For others, the magazine's features likely aided adoption. The next major US rifle also had a magazine-lock off.</p>
<p>Today, the Krag-Jørgensen is a popular rifle among <a href="/wiki/Collecting.html" title="Collecting">collectors</a>, and is valued by shooters for its smooth action.</p>

<h2>Early development</h2>
<p>The 1880s were an interesting period in the development of modern firearms. During this decade <a href="/wiki/Smokeless_powder.html" title="Smokeless powder">smokeless powder</a> came into general use, and the calibre of various service rifles diminished. Several nations adopted small calibre repeating bolt action rifles during this decade.</p>

An exploded view of an early Krag-Jørgensen</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Even though Norway had adopted the repeating <a href="/wiki/Jarmann_M1884.html" title="Jarmann M1884">Jarmann</a> rifle in 1884, it was soon clear that it was at best an interim weapon. <a href="/wiki/Ole_Krag.html" title="Ole Krag">Ole Krag</a>, captain in the Norwegian Army and director of <a href="/wiki/Kongsberg.html" title="Kongsberg">Kongsberg</a> Våpenfabrikk (the government weapons factory), therefore continued the development of small arms, as he had since at least 1866. Not satisfied with the tubular magazine of the Jarmann rifle and his earlier <a href="/wiki/Krag-Petersson.html" title="Krag-Petersson">Krag-Petersson</a> rifle (adopted by the Royal Norwegian Navy in 1876), he enlisted the help of master <a href="/wiki/Gunsmith.html" title="Gunsmith">gunsmith</a> <a href="/wiki/Erik_J%C3%B8rgensen.html" title="Erik Jørgensen">Erik Jørgensen</a>. Together they developed the <i>capsule</i> magazine. The principal feature of the capsule magazine was that instead of being a straight box protruding below the stock of the rifle, it wrapped around the bolt action. Early models contained ten rounds and were fitted to modified versions of the Jarmann — though they could be adapted to any bolt action rifle.<sup id="_ref-NMG_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 1886, <a href="/wiki/Denmark.html" title="Denmark">Denmark</a> was on the verge of adopting a new rifle for its armed forces. One of the early <a href="/wiki/Prototype.html" title="Prototype">prototypes</a> of the new rifle was sent to Denmark. The feedback given by the Danes was vital in the further development of the weapon. The test performed in Denmark revealed the need to lighten the rifle, as well as the possible benefits of a completely new action. Krag and Jørgensen therefore decided to convert the magazine into what they referred to as a 'half-capsule', containing only five rounds of ammunition instead of the previous ten.<sup id="_ref-NMG_1" class="reference"><a  title="">[1]</a></sup> They also, over the next several months, combined what they considered the best ideas from other gunsmiths with a number of their own ideas to design a distinct bolt action for their rifle. The long extractor, situated on top of the bolt, was inspired by the Jarmann mechanism, while the use of curved surfaces for cocking and ejecting the spent round was probably inspired by the designs from <a href="/wiki/Mauser.html" title="Mauser">Mauser</a>. For a time after the weapon was adopted by Denmark they experimented with dual frontal locking lugs, but decided against it on grounds of cost and weight. The ammunition of the day did not need dual frontal locking lugs, and the bolt already had three lugs—one in front, one just in front of the bolt handle, and the bolt handle itself—which were considered more than strong enough.</p>
<p>The rifle had a feature known as a magazne cut-off. This is a switch on the left rear of the receiver. When flipped down, the cut-off does not allow cartridges in the internal magazine to be fed into the chamber by the advancing bolt. This was intended to be used when soldiers were comfortably firing at distant targets, so it could be quickly turned off in case of an incoming charge or issue to charge the enemy. This instantly gives five rounds to the shooter for quick firing. The M1903 Springfield that replaced the Krags had a magazine cutoff, as did the SMLE (Lee Enfield) until 1915.</p>

The various Danish Krag-Jørgensen rifles and carbines.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>After strenuous tests, Denmark adopted the Krag-Jørgensen rifle on <a href="/wiki/1889.html" title="1889">1889</a>-<a href="/wiki/July_3.html" title="July 3">07-03</a>. The Danish rifle differed in several key areas from the weapons later adopted by the USA and Norway, particularly in its use of a forward (as opposed to downward) hinged magazine door, the use of rimmed ammunition, and the use of an outer steel liner for the barrel.<sup id="_ref-NMG_2" class="reference"><a  title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Danish Krag-Jørgensen was chambered for the 8x58R cartridge (0.31 in / 7.87 mm), and was at least in the early years used as a single shooter with the magazine in reserve. It stayed in service right up to the German invasion of Denmark on <a href="/wiki/1940.html" title="1940">1940</a>-<a href="/wiki/April_9.html" title="April 9">04-09</a>.</p>

<h3>Subtypes of the Danish Krag-Jørgensen</h3>
<p>While information on the various subtypes<sup id="_ref-danKJ_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[2]</a></sup> of the Krag-Jørgensen used in Denmark has proved difficult to find, at least the following subtypes were manufactured:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Rifle 1889</b>, stocked almost to the muzzle, no hand guard, straight bolt handle and an outer steel liner for the barrel. This weapon is typical of the period in having a long barrel and stock without pistol grip. Was originally issued without a safety catch; instead, a half-cock notch on the cocking piece/firing pin assembly served this purpose. In 1910, this weapon was modified by the addition of a manual safety, which was placed on the left side of the receiver just behind the closed bolt handle.</li>
<li><b>Artillery Carbine 1889</b> and <b>Infantry Carbine 1889</b>, differed only in placement of the sling-swivel, and looks like short versions of the Rifle 1889.</li>
<li><b>Engineer carbine M1889</b>, wooden hand guard, shorter than the other carbines.</li>
<li><b>Sniper rifle M1928</b>, an alteration of the rifle M1889 with a heavier barrel and a wooden hand guard, micrometer rear sight and hooded front sight.</li>

<p>Like many other armed forces, the <a href="/wiki/United_States_military.html" title="United States military">United States military</a> was searching for a new rifle in the early 1890s. A competition was held in 1892, comparing rifle designs from Lee, Krag, Mannlicher, Mauser, Schmidt-Rubin, and about 40 other military and civilian designs. The trials were held at <a href="/wiki/Governors_Island.html" title="Governors Island">Governors Island</a>, <a href="/wiki/New_York.html" title="New York">New York</a>. Despite protests from domestic inventors and arms manufacturers—two designers, Russell and Livermore, even sued the US government over the choice—an improved form of the Krag-Jørgensen won the contract.<sup id="_ref-NMG_3" class="reference"><a  title="">[1]</a></sup> The <a href="/wiki/United_States.html" title="United States">United States</a> formally adopted the rifle in 1892 to replace the single shot Springfield.

It was the U.S. military's main rifle from 1894 to 1903 when it was replaced by the <a href="/wiki/Springfield_1903_rifle.html" title="Springfield 1903 rifle">Springfield 1903 rifle</a> with its ballistically similar .30-03 cartridge, and found use in the <a href="/wiki/Spanish-American_War.html" title="Spanish-American War">Spanish-American War</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Philippine-American_War.html" title="Philippine-American War">Philippine-American War</a>. In this later war the rifle was referred to in a song popular with U.S. troops with a verse running:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Damn, damn, damn the Filipinos!</dd>
<dd>Cut throat khaki ladrones!</dd>
<dd>Underneath the starry flag,</dd>
<dd>Civilize them with a Krag,</dd>
<dd>And return us to our beloved home.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The US 'Krags' were chambered for the rimmed <a href="/wiki/.30-40_Krag.html" title=".30-40 Krag">.30-40 Krag</a> round, also known as <a href="/wiki/.30-40_Krag.html" title=".30-40 Krag">.30 Army</a>. The <a href="/wiki/.30-40.html" title=".30-40">.30-40 Krag</a> was the first smokeless powder round adopted by the U.S. military, but it retained the "caliber-charge" designation of earlier black powder cartridges. Thus the <a href="/wiki/.30-40.html" title=".30-40">.30-40 Krag</a> employs a .30 caliber (7.62 mm) bullet propelled by 40 grains (3 g) of smokeless powder. As with the <a href="/wiki/.30_WCF.html" title=".30 WCF">.30-30 Winchester</a>, it is the use of black powder nomenclature that leads to the incorrect assumption that the .30-40 Krag was once a black powder cartridge.</p>

The US M1899 Carbine.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>There were at least nine<sup id="_ref-US-KJ_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[3]</a></sup> different models of the American Krag-Jørgensen:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>M1892 Rifle</b>, with a 30 in (762 mm) barrel and a magazine cut off that operates in the up position. It can be identified by the cleaning rod under the barrel.</li>
<li><b>M1892 Carbine</b>, presumably a prototype, as just two are known today. Looks like the M1892 Rifle, but with a 22" barrel, including the long stock, and one-piece cleaning rod.</li>
<li><b>M1896 Rifle</b>, where the magazine cut-off operates in down position and the cleaning rod is moved to butt trap. An improved rear sight and tighter production tolerances gave better accuracy. Stock altered slightly (made thicker).</li>
<li><b>M1896 Cadet Rifle</b>, which was fitted with cleaning rod like M1892 rifle. Only about 400 were made before it was discontinued. The Cadet Rifle did not have sling swivels, and the lower band was retained by a band spring.</li>
<li><b>M1896 Carbine</b>, with the same modifications as the M1896 Rifle.</li>
<li><b>M1898 Rifle</b>, generally much like M1896, but with a wide range of minor changes.</li>
<li><b>M1898 Carbine</b>, same minor modifications as the M1898 Rifle. Only 5000 made, originally had the same short stock (rear sight touches band) as the Model 1896 Carbine; all were restocked as Model 1899s.</li>
<li><b>M1899 Carbine</b>, generally the same as the M1898 Carbine, but with a slightly longer forearm and hand guard, and without the swivel ring.</li>
<li><b>M1899 Constabulary carbine</b>, built for use in the Philippines. Basically a M1899 Carbine fitted with a full length stock and a bayonet lug, and the muzzle stepped down to accept bayonet.</li>

Norwegian soldiers in 1905, armed with the Krag-Jørgensen</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The Swedish-Norwegian Rifle Commission started its work in 1891. One of their first tasks was to find the best possible calibre for the new weapon, which was found to be 6.5 mm (0.256 in).<sup id="_ref-NMG_4" class="reference"><a  title="">[1]</a></sup> The round of ammunition is known variously as 6.5x55 Scan, 6.5x55 Mauser, 6.5x55 Swedish and 6.5x55 Nor, but they all referred to the same round although the shell dimension on the 6.5x55 Nor was slightly longer (0.15 mm / 0.006 in). Due to different interpretations of the blueprint standard, i.e. the standards of manufacturing using maximum chamber in the Krag vs. minimum chamber in the Swedish Mauser, a small percentage of the ammunition produced in Norway required a certain push on the bolt handle to chamber in the Swedish gun. However, a rumour arose not long after the round was adopted that one could use Swedish ammunition in Norwegian rifles, but not Norwegian ammunition in Swedish rifles.<sup id="_ref-NMG_5" class="reference"><a  title="">[1]</a></sup> Furthermore, the rumour stated that this was deliberate, to give Norway the tactical advantage of using captured ammunition in a war, while denying the same advantage to the Swedes. After the rumour first surfaced in 1900, it was examined by the Swedish military. They declared the difference to be insignificant, and that both the Swedish and Norwegian ammunition was within the specified parameters laid down. Despite this finding, the Swedish weapon-historian <a href="/wiki/Josef_Alm.html" title="Josef Alm">Josef Alm</a> repeated the rumour in a book in the 1930s, leading many to believe that there was a significant difference between the ammunition manufactured in Norway and Sweden.</p>
<p>Once the question of ammunition was settled, the Norwegians started looking at a modern weapon to fire their newly designed round. The processing was modelled on the US selection process performed in the same timeframe, and considered, among other things, sharp shooting at different ranges, shooting with defective rounds, shooting for speed, rust proofing, and ease of assembly and disassembly. After the test, three rifles were shortlisted:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/wiki/Mannlicher.html" title="Mannlicher">Mannlicher</a> 1892</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Mauser.html" title="Mauser">Mauser</a> 1893</li>
<li>Krag-Jørgensen 1892</li>
</ul>
<p>About fifty Krag-Jørgensen rifles were produced in 1893 and issued to soldiers for field testing. The reports were good, and a few modifications were incorporated into the design. The Norwegian <i><a href="/wiki/Storting.html" title="Storting">Storting</a></i> (<a href="/wiki/Parliament.html" title="Parliament">parliament</a>) decided in 1894 to adopt the Krag-Jørgensen as the new rifle for the Norwegian Army, and it was formally adopted on <a href="/wiki/April_21.html" title="April 21">April 21</a> that year. It is worth noting that <a href="/wiki/Sweden.html" title="Sweden">Sweden</a> instead adopted a modified Mauser in 1896. A total of more than 200,000 rifles were built in Norway, at a time when the population was less than three million people and Norway had yet to make money off the rich oilfields in the <a href="/wiki/North_Sea.html" title="North Sea">North Sea</a>. The various subtypes of Krag-Jørgensen replaced all rifles and carbines previously used by the Norwegian armed forces, notably the <a href="/wiki/Jarmann_M1884.html" title="Jarmann M1884">Jarmann M1884</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Krag-Petersson.html" title="Krag-Petersson">Krag-Petersson</a> and the last of the remaining <a href="/wiki/Remington_M1867.html" title="Remington M1867">Remington M1867</a> and modified <a href="/wiki/Kammerlader.html" title="Kammerlader">kammerladers</a> rim fire rifles and carbines.</p>

<p>The Krag-Jørgensen was produced in Norway for a very long time, and in a number of different variations. The major military models are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <b>M1894 Rifle</b>,<sup id="_ref-NMG-7_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[4]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-NMG-8_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[5]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-NMG-9_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[6]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-NMG-13_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[7]</a></sup> "Long Krag", was the most common Krag in Norway. A total of 122,817 were produced at Kongsberg until 1922 when production ended, as well as approximately 30,000 bought from <a href="/wiki/Steyr.html" title="Steyr">Steyr</a> weapons factory in <a href="/wiki/Austria.html" title="Austria">Austria</a>. In 1910, after some initial tests, 1,000 M1894s were fitted with telescopic sights on a specially constructed bracket. Issued five to each company, they were meant to be used against enemy officers and other high value targets. Since the model was considered to be less than satisfactory, further production was stopped.</li>
<li>The <b>M1895 Cavalry carbine</b> and <b>M1897 Mountain artillery</b> &amp; <b>Engineer carbine</b> differed only in how the strap was fitted to the stock, and were issued in one series. A total of 9,309 were made between the years 1898 and 1906.<sup id="_ref-NMG-11_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[8]</a></sup></li>
<li>The <b>M1904 Engineer carbine</b> &amp; <b>M1907 Field artillery carbine</b> differed from the earlier carbines mainly by being stocked to the muzzle. The difference between the two models was only in the attachment of the strap, and again they were issued as one series. A total of 3,500 were produced between 1906 and 1908.<sup id="_ref-NMG-11_1" class="reference"><a  title="">[8]</a></sup></li>
<li>The <b>M1906 Guttekarabin</b> (Boy's carbine) was a simplified M1895 carbine, with a shortened stock and no hand guard. They were issued to schools in Norway, and used to train boys aged 14 to 17 to shoot. Special "school ammunition" was developed to allow shooting in restricted areas. A total of 3,321 were made, of which 315 were later modified to fire .22 Long Rifle ammunition. Shooting was on the syllabus for Norwegian teens until World War II.<sup id="_ref-NMG-12_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[9]</a></sup></li>
<li>The <b>M1912 Carbine</b> / <b>M1912/16 Carbine</b> / <b>M1912/18 Carbine</b>, "short rifle", was made after it became clear that the long barrelled M1894 left something to be desired. The M1912 was adopted after experiments with shorter, thicker barrels and different projectiles. It differed from the earlier models by being stocked all the way to the muzzle; the bracket for the bayonet was moved from the barrel to under the stock. It was soon clear that the nose band was too weak, which led to the /16 and /18 modifications of the basic design. A total of 30,118 were produced between 1913 and 1926. It was also decided that any further production would be of this model.<sup id="_ref-NMG-14_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[10]</a></sup></li>
<li>The <b>M1923 Sniper rifle</b> was the first attempt to produce a <a href="/wiki/Sniper_rifle.html" title="Sniper rifle">sniper rifle</a>, but it was not solid enough for use in the field. A total of 630 were built between 1923 and 1926, half of which were sold to civilian sharpshooters. Most were later converted to M1930 or hunting rifles.<sup id="_ref-NMG-15_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[11]</a></sup></li>
<li>The <b>M1925 Sniper rifle</b> was an improved version of the M1923 built for the civilian market. A total of 1,900 were made from 1925 to the German invasion on <a href="/wiki/1940.html" title="1940">1940</a>-<a href="/wiki/April_9.html" title="April 9">04-09</a>. A further 250 were built for the Germans during the war, and the last 124 were put together in 1950.<sup id="_ref-NMG-16_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[12]</a></sup></li>
<li>The <b>M1930 Sniper rifle</b> was another improvement of the M1923 and M1925, featuring a heavier barrel, a different stock, sights, and a fine tuned trigger. It was a successful weapon, but no more than 466 were built between 1930 and 1939.<sup id="_ref-NMG-17_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[13]</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, most models were produced for the civilian market as well. After <a href="/wiki/World_War_II.html" title="World War II">WWII</a> a limited number of Krag-Jørgensens were made in purely civilian models.</p>

<h3>Bayonets for Norwegian Krag-Jørgensen</h3>
<p>The Swedish-Norwegian Rifle Commission only briefly looked into <a href="/wiki/Bayonet.html" title="Bayonet">bayonets</a>, focusing on selecting the best possible rifle. However, their report<sup id="_ref-NMG-22_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[14]</a></sup> mentions that they have experimented with knife shaped bayonets and <a href="/wiki/Spike_bayonet.html" title="Spike bayonet">spike bayonets</a>, both in loose forms and in folding forms. Very few of the experimental bayonets are known today.</p>
<p>The bayonet that was finally approved, probably alongside the rifle itself, was a knife bayonet.<sup id="_ref-NMG-22_1" class="reference"><a  title="">[14]</a></sup> Later on longer bayonets was approved as well, and renewed experiments with spike bayonets took place during the development of the M/1912.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Bayonet M/1894</b> was a long knifebayonet, with a bladelenght of 21.5 cm, a bladewidth of 1.9 cm and a total length of 33.5 cm. The <a href="/wiki/Scabbard.html" title="Scabbard">scabbard</a> was made of steel, hanging from a leather strap, and was 22.7 cm long. A total of 101750<sup id="_ref-NMG-22_2" class="reference"><a  title="">[14]</a></sup> was manufactured by Kongsberg Våpenfabrikk, Husquarna and Steyr.</li>
<li><b>Bayonet M/1912</b> was constructed during the development of the 'short rifle' that became the M1912 Carbine. It was significantly longer than the M/1894, to maintain the 'reach' of the soldier. The total length of the bayonet was 48.5 cm, of which 38.5 cm was blade. The very long blade proved to be too weak for actual use, and the Bayonet M/1913 was adopted instead.<sup id="_ref-NMG-22_3" class="reference"><a  title="">[14]</a></sup></li>
<li><b>Bayonet M/1913</b> was stronger, but heavier, than the M/1912 but was or identical size.<sup id="_ref-NMG-22_4" class="reference"><a  title="">[14]</a></sup> However, it soon became clear that the short rifles was to weak in the stock to be used with the very long bayonets, which lead to the development of the M1912/16 and M1912/18 carabines. Production was ended after 3000 was manufactured by Kongsberg Våpenfabrikk in favour of the M/1916.<sup id="_ref-NMG-22_5" class="reference"><a  title="">[14]</a></sup></li>
<li><b>Bayonet M/1916</b> was meant to be used on both the short carabines and the long rifles. Of almost identical size to the previous M/1913, it was stronger and had a sharpened edge along both sides of the blade.<sup id="_ref-NMG-22_6" class="reference"><a  title="">[14]</a></sup> The scabards to the M/1916 was initialy of leather, but was later changed to steel. The production run is unknown.</li>
<li><b>Bayonet M/1894/1943</b> was a variation of the Bayonet M/1894 manufactured during the war for delivery to Nazi Germany. Only 3300 was manufactured, all of lower quality than the bayonets delivered before the German invasion.<sup id="_ref-NMG-22_7" class="reference"><a  title="">[14]</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<p>A number of special bayonets and oddeties was experimented with during the time the Krag-Jørgensen was a Norwegian service rifle, two of which deserve mentioning.</p>
<ul>
<li>The <b>Officers bayonet</b> was an attempt to replace the traditional sidearm for offiers in <a href="/wiki/Dress_uniform.html" title="Dress uniform">dress uniform</a> with a high quaility, decorated M/11916.<sup id="_ref-NMG-22_8" class="reference"><a  title="">[14]</a></sup> The prototype was made in 1928, with two different scabards (one in black laquered steel, the other in brown leather), poished blade and the <a href="/wiki/Coat_of_arms_of_Norway.html" title="Coat of arms of Norway">coat of arms</a> inlaid in the handle. The bayonet was never issued, and the prototype is lost.</li>
<li>The <b>Bayonet 'lengthener'</b> was a special scabard for the M/1894 with a bayonet mount added.<sup id="_ref-NMG-22_9" class="reference"><a  title="">[14]</a></sup> By mounting the bayonet to the scabard, and the scabard to the rifle, a total length of 47 cm was accived. It is speculated<sup id="_ref-NMG-22_10" class="reference"><a  title="">[14]</a></sup> that the reason was to acchive the same reach as with the M/1916 without having to scrap the huge quantities of M/1894 in storage. The 'lenghteners' was never issued.</li>

<p>During the German <a href="/wiki/Nazi_occupation_of_Norway.html" title="Nazi occupation of Norway">occupation of Norway</a> (<a href="/wiki/1940.html" title="1940">1940</a>-<a href="/wiki/April_9.html" title="April 9">04-09</a> to <a href="/wiki/1945.html" title="1945">1945</a>-<a href="/wiki/May_8.html" title="May 8">05-08</a>), the German forces demanded that Kongsberg Våpenfabrikk build weapons for the German armed forces.<sup id="_ref-NMG-18_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[15]</a></sup> They placed large orders for the Krag-Jørgensen, the Colt M1914 (license-produced Colt <a href="/wiki/M1911.html" title="M1911">M1911</a>), and 40 mm anti-aircraft guns. However, production was kept down by sabotage and slow work by the employees. Out of the total of 13,450 rifles ordered by the Germans, only between 3,350 and 3,800 were actually delivered. To begin with, the order was for standard M1894s, but during the war the model was altered to be externally more like the German <a href="/wiki/Karabiner_98k.html" title="Karabiner 98k">Kar98K</a>. Experiments with using German <a href="/wiki/7%2C92_x_57_mm.html" title="7,92 x 57 mm">7,92 x 57 mm</a> ammunition also took place, a cartridge as powerful as the <a href="/wiki/.30-06.html" title=".30-06">.30-06</a> and the modern <a href="/wiki/7.62_mm_NATO.html" title="7.62 mm NATO">7.62 mm NATO</a>.<sup id="_ref-NMG-18_1" class="reference"><a  title="">[15]</a></sup></p>
<p>While information on the <a href="/wiki/Wehrmacht.html" title="Wehrmacht">Wehrmacht</a>'s use of the Krag-Jørgensen is hard to find, it must be assumed that it was issued primarily to second line units since the Wehrmacht attempted to only issue firearms in standard calibres to front line troops. It was also issued to the Hird - the armed part of <a href="/wiki/Nasjonal_Samling.html" title="Nasjonal Samling">Nasjonal Samling</a> (NS) ("National Unity"), the <a href="/wiki/National-socialist.html" title="National-socialist">national-socialist</a> party of <a href="/wiki/Vidkun_Quisling.html" title="Vidkun Quisling">Vidkun Quisling</a>'s <a href="/wiki/Puppet_government.html" title="Puppet government">puppet government</a>. It's further likely that the experiments with 7.92 mm ammunition means that the Germans considered a wider use of the Krag-Jørgensen.</p>

<h2>Post-war production</h2>
<p>A few Krag-Jørgensen rifles were put together after 1945, for sale to civilian hunters and sharpshooters.<sup id="_ref-NMG-19_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[16]</a></sup> While there were at no point any plans for re-equipping the Norwegian Army with the Krag-Jørgensen, attempts were made to adapt it to firing more modern, high-powered ammunition like the <a href="/wiki/.30-06.html" title=".30-06">.30-06</a> and <a href="/wiki/7.62_mm_NATO.html" title="7.62 mm NATO">7.62 mm NATO</a> rounds. While this was found to be possible, it required a new barrel (or relined barrels) and modification to the bolt and receiver. The resulting cost of the conversion was about the same as that of a new gun of a more modern design.<sup id="_ref-NMG-20_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[17]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-NMG-19_1" class="reference"><a  title="">[16]</a></sup> The last Krag-Jørgensen in production was the m/1952 Elk-rifle, of which 470 were sold during the 1950s.</p>

<h3>Model rifles</h3>
<p>The so called model rifles were used both when the various sub types were approved and as a guide for manufacturing. Basically, the model rifle or model carbine was a specially manufactured weapon that showed how the approved weapon should be. They were numbered and stored separately. Several model rifles and carbines were manufactured, since small things like a change in surface treatment or other seemingly minor things. There were especially many model rifles made for the M1894, since several were sent to Staur to work as controls and models.</p>

It was realised that converting the Jarmann was more cost efficient than converting the Krag-Jørgensen, so further conversions was halted. It it not known how many that was converted in this way.</p>

The single prototype of a M1894 modified for belt feed.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>In the factory museum at Kongsberg Weapon Factory, there is preserved an interesting prototype of a M1894 modified for belt feed. Although no documentation has been uncovered, it's clear that the rifle has been modified at an early stage in the manufacturing process to use the same feed belts as was used on the <a href="/wiki/Hotchkiss_machine_gun.html" title="Hotchkiss machine gun">Hotchkiss</a> <a href="/wiki/Heavy_machine_gun.html" title="Heavy machine gun">heavy machine gun</a> that was in use in the Norwegian Army at the time.</p>
<p>The backwards and forward movement of the bolt operates a mechanism that moves the belt through the receiver, presenting fresh rounds for the weapon. While this might have been advantageous while fighting from fixed fortifications, it cannot have been very practical for the user of the rifle to carry a long feed belt with him in the field. Even so, it is an interesting and early attempt to increase the firepower of the Krag-Jørgensen.</p>

The 'Speed Loader' mounted on a M1894</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>In 1923 Lieutenant Tobiesen, working at Kongsberg Weapon Factory, designed what he called a 'Speed Loader for repeating rifles'. It can be seen as a new attempt to increase the firepower of the Krag-Jørgensen, just as the attempt to convert it to belt feed. Basically, the design consisted of a modified cover that let the user of the rifle attach a magazine from the Madsen <a href="/wiki/Light_machine_gun.html" title="Light machine gun">light machine gun</a>. The cover had a selectorswitch, allowing the user to select if he wanted to use the Krag-Jørgensen's internal magazine with its 5 rounds of ammunition, or if he wanted to use the external magazine with 25 rounds.</p>
<p>The design was considered promising enough that 8 prototypes were manufactured and tested. However, in testing it was revealed that the heavy magazine mounted on the side of the weapon not only made the rifle more cumbersome to carry and use, but also made it list sideways. Deciding the 'Speed Loader' was not a practical design for military use, no further manufacture took place.</p>
<p>In 1926, a group of seal hunters approached Kongsberg Weapon Factory and asked to purchase a number of Speed Loaders for use when hunting seals from small boats. They were turned down due to the high cost of manufacturing a limited number of the device.</p>

<h3>Krag-Jørgensen rifles modified to self loaders</h3>
<p>At the same time that the hotchkiss heavy machine gun was introduced to the Norwegian Army, some people started considering modifying the Krag-Jørgensen to semi-automatic fire. Doing so would have multiplied the firepower of the infantry, allowing more weight of fire to be brought at a target. Most of the designs put forward were not very well thought out, and few of the designers knew enough about firearms to be able to calculate the pressures and dimensions necessary. However, two designs were investigated further, and eventually one prototype was built.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Sunngaard's automatic rifle">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Sunngaard.27s_automatic_rifle" id="Sunngaard.27s_automatic_rifle"></a></p>
<h4>Sunngaard's automatic rifle</h4>
<p>In 1915 Sergant Sunngaard proposed a design for making the Krag-Jørgensen into a selfloading rifle. The design was considered over a period of time before it was declared to be 'quite without value', primarily because the requisite pressure would not be attainable without major redesign of the rifle. For this reason, no prototype was made.</p>

M1894 modified with SNABB38.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>In 1938 a Swedish design surfaced that seemed interesting. The SNABB was a modification that could be made to virtually any bolt action rifle that allowed it to be converted into a self loading weapon, thus saving money as compared to manufacturing new weapons from scratch. The device used gas pressure to operate the bolt handle with the help of a runner. The modification seems, in hindsight, to be unnecessarily complicated. A separate pistolgrip was needed, and the receiver needed major modifications.</p>
<p>A prototype was manufactured in the autumn of 1938, and tested for several months. While moderately successful, the modification would cost about three times as much as originally thought, and the project was dropped due to lack of money.</p>

<p><a name="Ammunition" id="Ammunition"></a></p>
<h2>Ammunition</h2>
<p>The various Krag-Jørgensens were manufactured for a wide variety of ammunition. Apart from various civilian calibres, the rifle was manufactured for the following service ammunition:</p>
<ul>
<li>Danish 8x58R, a 7.87 mm (0.31 in) rimmed round. Early rounds had a 15.3 <a href="/wiki/Grams.html" title="Grams">grams</a> (236 <a href="/wiki/Grain_%28measure%29.html" title="Grain (measure)">grains</a>) long round nosed bullet, and was loaded so that it produced a muzzle velocity of about 580 <a href="/wiki/M/s.html" title="M/s">m/s</a> (roughly 1900 ft/s), while later rounds had a 12.8 grams (198 grains) spitzer bullet and gave a muzzle velocity of 823 m/s (2740 ft/s).<sup id="_ref-homeload_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[19]</a></sup></li>
<li>US <a href="/wiki/.30-40_Krag.html" title=".30-40 Krag">30-40</a>, a 7.62 mm (0.30 in) rimmed round loaded with 40 grains (3 grams) of smokeless powder. It gave a chamber pressure of 40000 lbf/in² (276 MPa), which resulted in a muzzle velocity of 609.6 m/s (2000 ft/s) in the rifles, and 597.4 m/s (1960 ft/s) from the shorter barrel of the carbines.<sup id="_ref-US-KJ_1" class="reference"><a  title="">[3]</a></sup></li>
<li><a href="/wiki/6.5_x_55.html" title="6.5 x 55">6.5x55</a> a 6.5 mm (0.256 in) rimless round. Most variations are loaded for a chamber pressure of 350 MPa (roughly 51000 lbf/in²). Early rounds, with a 10.1 grams (156 grains) long round nosed bullet (B-projectile) had a muzzle velocity of around 700 m/s (roughly 2300 ft/s), while later rounds with a 9 grams (139 grains) spitzer bullet (D-projectile) offered a muzzle velocity up to 870 m/s (2854 ft/s).<sup id="_ref-NMG_6" class="reference"><a  title="">[1]</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<p>Contarty to some rumous, the Krag-Jørgensen action can be modified to fire modern, high power cartridges. During World War 2, and also in the early '50s, several was produced in <a href="/wiki/7%2C92_x_57_mm.html" title="7,92 x 57 mm">7,92 x 57 mm</a>, which can hardly be considered a low power cartridge. A number of Krag-Jørgensen has also been converted to <a href="/wiki/.30-06.html" title=".30-06">.30-06</a> and <a href="/wiki/7.62_mm_NATO.html" title="7.62 mm NATO">7.62 mm NATO</a> for targetshooting and hunting. However, it must be stressed that these were all late production Norwegian Krag-Jørgensen rifles, made in an era when metallurgy was vastly more advanced than when the American Krag-Jørgensen rifles was made.</p>
