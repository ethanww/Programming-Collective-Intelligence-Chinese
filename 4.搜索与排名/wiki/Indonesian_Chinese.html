<h2>Demographics</h2>
<p>The economic activities and wealth of the Chinese community in Indonesia is hugely diverse; many are farmers and small-scale merchants, and others are businessmen. Most are identified as ethnic Chinese in official documents, but many are not, for a variety of reasons. In many parts of Indonesia, however, they are represented among the wealthier classes out of proportion with their small numbers. According to a survey of corporations listed on the <a href="/wiki/Jakarta_Stock_Exchange.html" title="Jakarta Stock Exchange">Jakarta Stock Exchange</a>, the Chinese Indonesian community was thought to own or operate a large fraction of major Indonesian corporations. This is a result of a long government restriction for Chinese Indonesians from going into academia, public service and other governmental occupations. However, some believe that this estimate overestimates the influence of Chinese Indonesians on the economy: for example, despite being considered to be under control of Chinese Indonesians in research, the Salim Group is actually controlled by <a href="/wiki/Sudono_Salim.html" title="Sudono Salim">Liem Sioe Liong</a>, two pribumi relatives of then President Suharto, and Ibrahim Risyad, an Acehnese associate of one of Suharto's cousins.</p>
<p>Such simplifications fuel the <a href="/wiki/Stereotype.html" title="Stereotype">stereotype</a> that Chinese Indonesian people are all extremely wealthy, a common perception in Indonesian society. In part as a result of this perceived dominance of the economy, Chinese Indonesian community has frequently been viewed with suspicion by indigenous (Pribumi) Indonesians.</p>

<h3>Colonial Era to Early 20th Century (1500s-1900s)</h3>
<p>Race relations between Chinese Indonesian and native Indonesians have always been problematic. Some commentators trace this to the <a href="/wiki/Dutch_colonial_empire.html" title="Dutch colonial empire">Dutch</a> era when <a href="/wiki/Colonial.html" title="Colonial">colonial</a> policy favored ethnic Chinese - and in so doing established their economic dominance over the region. The caste system established by the Dutch also made it disadvantageous for ethnic Chinese (and members of other races) to assimilate into the native population: this would mean being put in the third estate, the lowest one, together with the natives. Ethnic Chinese, on the other hand, together with Arabs and other <b>Foreign Orientals</b> were put in the second estate, just a notch beneath the first estate, a category reserved for Europeans and, ironically, Japanese and Siamese nationals as well.</p>
<p>Colonial race politics aside, many ethnic Chinese were supporters of colonial rule. Indeed, in the early years of the Netherlands East Indies, ethnic Chinese helped strengthen Dutch domination in the region. Souw Ben Kong, the Kapitan Cina of Banten, for example, organized a large-scale immigration of Chinese under his rule to <a href="/wiki/Jakarta.html" title="Jakarta">Batavia</a> in the seventeenth century. This significantly destabilized the Bantenese economy, thus facilitating Dutch conquest of the Sultanate. As a reward, Souw was made the first Kapitein der Chinezen of Batavia. His successors, the Kapiteins and, later, the Majoors der Chinezen of Batavia, were given landed fiefdoms and the hereditary title of Sia by the colonial government. Between them, these aristocratic Peranakan families controlled a great deal of Java's land and wealth. Through the officership system, moreover, they governed the Peranakan and ethnic Chinese population of Batavia. The system was later extended to other centers of Dutch power in Java and parts of the rest of the archipelago. <sup title="The text in the vicinity of this tag needs citation." class="noprint">[<a  title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><i>citation&#160;needed</i></a>]</sup></p>
<p>Beginning in the late nineteenth century, most of these families underwent rapid <a href="/wiki/Westernization.html" title="Westernization">westernization</a>. By the early decades of the twentieth century, many of them (especially those domiciled around Batavia) had become more "Dutch" than the Dutch themselves: the Sias were consequently some of the strongest proponents of colonial rule. Their hold over the economy, however, was systematically destroyed by the very government they supported in the 1920s and 1930s. Following <a href="/wiki/Wilhelmina_of_the_Netherlands.html" title="Wilhelmina of the Netherlands">Queen Wilhelmina</a>'s speech to the Estates General, the Dutch Parliament, in which she insisted that a "moral debt" was owed to the people of the East Indies, the colonial government implemented its so-called "social policy". This was aimed at ending feudalism in Java and breaking up the large estates of the Peranakan aristocracy. At this period the native aristocracy did not own much land due to their belief that influence on citizens, rather than ownership of land, is the base of their power. The native aristocracy owes their employment to the Dutch in the civil service. The Dutch compulsory acquisition of Peranakan fiefdoms destroyed many of the older landowning families. While some managed to go into business successfully, most former Sias (their title became obsolete by the 1940s) were swamped in economic power by Totok Chinese. This latter group remains, even today, the most powerful economic group in Indonesia. <sup title="The text in the vicinity of this tag needs citation." class="noprint">[<a  title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><i>citation&#160;needed</i></a>]</sup></p>
<p>The Chinese Indonesians built their first schools in <a href="/wiki/Surabaya.html" title="Surabaya">Surabaya</a> in the 1920s — one of the first non-Western schools in Java — and by the 1960s many Chinese schools had been established in the major cities. The first Chinese newspapers were also printed during this era, and several Chinese political parties were established. These political parties range from those who saw themselves as part of the Indonesian nationalism movement, and those who felt that Chinese Indonesians are still Chinese citizens, a question that was left unresolved for many decades. <sup title="The text in the vicinity of this tag needs citation." class="noprint">[<a  title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><i>citation&#160;needed</i></a>]</sup></p>
<p>&lt;--begin add--&gt; The largest waves of <a href="/wiki/China.html" title="China">Chinese</a> migration happened during early to middle <a href="/wiki/Dutch_colonial_empire.html" title="Dutch colonial empire">Dutch</a> colonial era, from about 16th to 19th century, to find new opportunities to trade.

This was manifested in strong desires to return home and considered Indonesia as yet another temporary settlement.</p>
<p>Starting from the middle 18th century, the <a href="/wiki/Qing_Dynasty.html" title="Qing Dynasty">Qing</a> <a href="/wiki/Qing_dynasty_emperors.html" title="Qing dynasty emperors">Emperor</a> of the time, <a href="/wiki/Qian_Long.html" title="Qian Long">Qian Long</a>, considered these expatriates as turncoats and thereby a threat to China. Although Emperor Qian Long adopted closed-door policy, there was no evidence that Chinese expatriates were banned. Many of them, however, found Indonesia as an increasingly attractive settlement. The hostile and oppressive <a href="/wiki/Manchurian.html" title="Manchurian">Manchurian</a> government of Qing dynasty brought even more migrants from China. This was further magnified with Dutch favor toward Chinese Indonesian, mainly because they were intelligent, diligent, and capable to oversee Dutch plantations.</p>
<p>Lulled by comfortable lives, some of them no longer associated themselves with mainland China. They were called <a href="/wiki/Peranakan.html" title="Peranakan"><i>Cina Baba</i>s</a> or <a href="/wiki/Peranakan.html" title="Peranakan">Peranakans</a>. <i>Cina Baba</i>s often intermarry with indigenous <a href="/wiki/Indonesian.html" title="Indonesian">Indonesian</a> (<i>pribumi</i>s). Some of them identified themselves as Dutchmen, embraced Christianity and generally enjoyed higher education and social status, and thereby considered themselves as more culturally refined. They were called <i>Qiao Sheng</i> (僑生, <i>lit.</i> foreign-borned). Those who still maintained ties toward China, whose main belief was <a href="/wiki/Confucianism.html" title="Confucianism">Confucianism</a>, considered <i>Cina Baba</i>s and <i>Qiao Sheng</i>s unfilial. Even more so because <i>Cina Baba</i>s and <i>Qiao Sheng</i>s typically shunned Chinese tradition. The ones who still maintained "purity" were called <i>Cina Totok</i>s. These three groups of Chinese Indonesian had starkly different nationalistic views. At the time, <i>Qiao Sheng</i>s were more inclined toward the Dutch; <i>Cina Totok</i>s were more inclined toward mainland China; and <i>Cina Baba</i>s were more toward Indonesia.</p>

<h3>Indonesian National Revolution</h3>
<p>During the <a href="/wiki/Indonesian_National_Revolution.html" title="Indonesian National Revolution">Indonesian National Revolution</a> many Chinese Indonesians supported the Independence movement. The BPUPKI -- Body for Investigating Preparation Attempts of Indonesia's Independence (Badan Penyelidik Usaha-usaha Persiapan Kemerdekaan Indonesia) -- included six ethnic Chinese members who contributed to the drafting of the Indonesian Constitution in 1945. Moreover, the Chinese weekly Sin Po was the first to openly publish the text to the national anthem <i>Indonesia Raya</i> in November 1928.</p>
<p>There was discussion on the formation of all-Chinese Indonesian units in the war for Independence <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.indonesiamedia.com/rubrik/manca/manca99november-sejarah.htm">[2]</a>, similar to the formation of the all-<a href="/wiki/Japanese_American.html" title="Japanese American">Japanese American</a> Nisei units in <a href="/wiki/World_War_Two.html" title="World War Two">World War Two</a>. This suggestion was ultimately rejected, and the ethic Chinese were urged to instead join their local pro-Independence groups instead. In 1946 the <a href="/wiki/Consul_General.html" title="Consul General">Consul General</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Republic_of_China.html" title="Republic of China">Republic of China</a> Chiang Chia Tung expressed in Malang that the ROC supported Indonesia's independence.</p>

<p><a name="Early_20th_Century_to_Independence_.281900s-1945.29" id="Early_20th_Century_to_Independence_.281900s-1945.29"></a></p>
<h3>Early 20th Century to Independence (1900s-1945)</h3>
<p>Later waves of migrants still maintained ties to China, especially by supporting Chinese nationalistic movements to overthrow Qing dynasty. Although the support was mainly monetary, some Chinese Indonesian were actively involved in the inside politics, especially so during <a href="/wiki/Sun_Yat_Sen.html" title="Sun Yat Sen">Sun Yat Sen</a> era. <i>Cina Totok</i>s were particularly active. Although communist China was largely unsupported at first, their effort on driving Japan out of China gained support of many <i>Cina Totok</i>s and even some <i>Qiao Sheng</i>s. Thus the support of mainland China was divided into two camps: <a href="/wiki/Kuomintang.html" title="Kuomintang">Nationalistic (Guomindang)</a> and <a href="/wiki/Communist_Party_of_China.html" title="Communist Party of China">Communistic (Gong Chan Dang)</a>.</p>
<p>At the turn of the 20th century, however, <i>Cina Totok</i>s were increasingly assimilated into Indonesian culture. Younger generations still tried to maintain ties with China, but considered themselves as Indonesians and therefore adopted more Indonesian-Chinese nationalistic views.</p>
<p>Although the Dutch gave Chinese Indonesian special status, the Dutch were increasingly oppresive and discriminative against all Chinese Indonesian. So, all three groups <i>Qiao Sheng</i>s, <i>Cina Baba</i>s, and <i>Cina Totok</i>s, were more and more cooperative toward Indonesian nationalistic movement, especially in giving monetary support.</p>
<p>More and more Chinese Indonesian were involved in Indonesian politics. <i>Cina Totok</i>s typically set up political parties which aimed toward Indonesia-China alliance and established newspapers. <i>Cina Baba</i>s and <i>Qiao Sheng</i>s typically joined other nationalistic parties and even assisted nationalistic movement parties as Dutch or Japanese officers.</p>
<p>All three groups were the pioneers of the usage of Indonesian language, even eclipsed the <i>pribumi</i>s in terms of quantity of publication. They were also among the pioneers of Indonesian newspapers. They published their political thoughts along with contributions from other Indonesian writers in their fledgling publishing companies. They even risked their lives as the Dutch banned nationalistic publications.</p>
<p>Chinese Indonesian were very active in supporting independence movement during the 1940s, as Japan absolved all but one Chinese Indonesian political party, <a  class="new" title="Huaqiao Zhonghui">Huaqiao Zhonghui</a> (华侨中会). Some notable ones were <a  class="new" title="Siauw Giok Tjhan">Siauw Giok Tjhan</a> and <a  class="new" title="Liem Koen Hian">Liem Koen Hian</a>. Some of them, such as <a  class="new" title="Yap Tjwan Bing">Yap Tjwan Bing</a>, became Japanese officers along with other Indonesians to form the agency that later oversees the independence effort, BPUPKI. Their effort culminated into assisting the preparation of the declaration of Indonesian independence at 17 August 1945. &lt;--end add--&gt;</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Post-independence and New Order Era">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Post-independence_and_New_Order_Era" id="Post-independence_and_New_Order_Era"></a></p>
<h3>Post-independence and New Order Era</h3>
<p>In the <a href="/wiki/1960.html" title="1960">1960s</a> many government regulations, such as <a href="/wiki/Anti-Chinese_legislation_in_Indonesia.html" title="Anti-Chinese legislation in Indonesia">PP 10/1959</a>, restricted the Chinese Indonesian from the rural areas, and forced many to relocate to the big cities. Moreover, political pressures in the <a href="/wiki/1970.html" title="1970">1970s</a> and <a href="/wiki/1980.html" title="1980">1980s</a> restricted the role of the Chinese Indonesian in politics, academics and the military. As a result, they were since then constrained professionally to becoming entrepreneurs and professional managers in trade, manufacturing, and banking. In the <a href="/wiki/1970.html" title="1970">1970s</a>, following the failed alleged Communist coup attempt in 1965, there was a strong sentiment against the Chinese Indonesian, who were accused of being Communist collaborators.</p>
<p>Most Chinese Indonesian are not <a href="/wiki/Muslim.html" title="Muslim">Muslim</a>, further fomenting negative sentiments from the mostly Muslim native Indonesians. This is ironic in light of the fact that some of the earliest Muslim evangelists in Java (who were called the <i><a  class="new" title="Wali Songo">Wali Songo</a></i> or 'The Nine Ambassadors') were of Chinese ancestry. A historical theory even suggests that the first people who brought Islamic faith to Indonesia were the Chinese traders, especially those who came to <a href="/wiki/Semarang.html" title="Semarang">Semarang</a> under the leadership of Sam Po Kong or Admiral <a href="/wiki/Zheng_He.html" title="Zheng He">Zheng He</a> (Zheng He himself was not a Han, but a Muslim from a minority ethnic group in China).</p>
<p>Various government policies banned <a href="/wiki/Chinese_language.html" title="Chinese language">Chinese language</a> teaching, speaking, and publication. Established schools and colleges run by Chinese-Indonesian foundations were nationalized and their facilities seized without compensation and converted to state or pribumi-run schools, such as Universitas Res Publica, which became Universitas Trisakti. A <a href="/wiki/Anti-Chinese_legislation_in_Indonesia.html" title="Anti-Chinese legislation in Indonesia">presidential directive</a> forced Chinese Indonesian to abandon their <a href="/wiki/Chinese_name.html" title="Chinese name">Chinese names</a> and <a  class="new" title="Indonesian-sounding name adopted by Chinese Indonesian">adopt Indonesian names</a>. Anti-Chinese sentiments increased among the pribumi Indonesians and anti-Chinese pogroms were frequent. In identity cards, all Chinese Indonesians were designated as "WNI" (Warga Negara Indonesia = Citizen of Indonesia), a euphemism for "ethnic Chinese" as opposed to just "Indonesian" for the pribumi Indonesians. This made it easy for government officials to extract bribes and side payments, and has been compared to Jews under Hitler being required to wear the Star of David badge on their chests. Ethnic Chinese must hold certificates of having rejected Chinese citizenship, despite being native-born and having lived in Indonesia for generations.</p>
<p>These highly discriminatory laws are believed by some as a concerted government effort at cultural genocide. Those Chinese Indonesians who could not stand the discrimination fled. The Totoks returned to mainland China (only to catch themselves trapped in Cultural Revolution), and the Peranakans to the old masters' country, the Netherlands.</p>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/1998.html" title="1998">1998</a>, preceding the fall of <a href="/wiki/Suharto.html" title="Suharto">Suharto</a>'s 32-year presidency, <a href="/wiki/Jakarta_Riots_of_May_1998.html" title="Jakarta Riots of May 1998">big riots</a> targeted the Chinese Indonesians, <a href="/wiki/Pogrom.html" title="Pogrom">pogrom</a> style. It is verified and confirmed that Chinese homes were looted and burned, and many Chinese people were raped or killed<a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.fas.org/irp/world/indonesia/indonesia-1998.htm">[3]</a>. The events in 1998 were significant because unlike earlier <a href="/wiki/Pogrom.html" title="Pogrom">pogroms</a> against Chinese Indonesian, due to the Internet this incident spread world wide in real-time, arousing the interest and feelings of the ethnic Chinese in <a href="/wiki/China.html" title="China">China</a> and other countries, leading to demonstrations against Indonesia in many countries with significant Chinese populations and protests to the government of Indonesia. After the tragedy, a large number of Chinese Indonesians fled to other countries, such as USA, Australia, Singapore, and the Netherlands. Adding insult to injury, Habibie, the unpopular president after Suharto, ridiculed the fleeing Chinese as being unpatriotic. Ironically, Habibie himself left Indonesia to live in Germany after his performance report (pidato pertanggungjawaban) was rejected by the new, democratically elected parliament in 1999.</p>
<p>Because of discrimination, most Chinese Indonesians were not politically active and could not lobby for legislation to protect their own interests despite their economical affluence. The situation is different in neighboring <a href="/wiki/Malaysia.html" title="Malaysia">Malaysia</a> where the overseas Chinese have been both politically and economically active despite being a minority in a similar environment (better off economically in a Muslim majority country).</p>
<p>Despite laws and sentiments against the Chinese Indonesian, many have succeeded in fields other than business, most notably in the sport of <a href="/wiki/Badminton.html" title="Badminton">badminton</a>, the most popular competitive sport in Indonesia. <a  class="new" title="List of indonesian athletes">Indonesian athletes</a> dominated the sport from the 1960s to the 1990s. Many of the beloved players and coaches are Chinese Indonesians, such as Tan Joe Hok, <a href="/wiki/Rudy_Hartono.html" title="Rudy Hartono">Rudy Hartono</a>, <a href="/wiki/Christian_Hadinata.html" title="Christian Hadinata">Christian Hadinata</a>, Tjun Tjun, Johan Wahjudi, Ade Chandra, <a href="/wiki/Liem_Swie_King.html" title="Liem Swie King">Liem Swie King</a>, Ivana Lie, Verawaty, <a href="/wiki/Susi_Susanti.html" title="Susi Susanti">Susi Susanti</a>, <a href="/wiki/Alan_Budikusuma.html" title="Alan Budikusuma">Alan Budikusuma</a>, Ardy Wiranata, and Heryanto Arbi.</p>
<p>&lt;--start add--&gt; During the 1940-1945 war of independence and through the war to defend the independence from Dutch until 1950, surprisingly few Chinese Indonesian were involved in the liberation army. At that time, the economy plummeted and the taxes went sky high. Even everyday goods, such as soaps and spoons, were very rare as Dutch and Japanese confiscated many of them for their own army. Chinese Indonesian contribution in this era was in the smuggling of these goods. However, smuggling was increasingly difficult as Japan affirmed their foothold in Indonesia. Armed conflicts were inevitable. Nevertheless, Chinese Indonesian risked their lives for it.</p>
<p>After the independence, the Japanese and Dutch were routed. Their companies were vacant or sold in very cheap prices. As Chinese Indonesian were apt at trades, they quickly assimilated these companies. However, many <i>pribumi</i>s were dissatisfied with the outcome and sought to curb this effort. They were successful in accusing that Chinese Indonesian were rarely involved in armed conflicts and thereby the fledgling Indonesian government forced Chinese Indonesian to relinquish some of them. This upset many Chinese Indonesian. Some reduced their activities in politics, but some were still active and even served as ministers to the newly established republic.</p>
<p>The <i>pribumi</i>s still felt left out and discriminated as the economy was increasingly dominated by Chinese Indonesian. The <i>pribumi</i>s decried the government's lackluster effort to provide level playing field and sought even more aggressive predicaments. This further escalated the tension of the already uneasy relationship between <i>pribumi</i>s and Chinese Indonesian. <i>Pribumi</i>s always considered Chinese Indonesian as the agents of the colonials. The tendency of Chinese Indonesian flocking together in <i>Pecinan</i> or <a href="/wiki/Chinatown.html" title="Chinatown">Chinatowns</a>, segregated from the <i>pribumi</i>s, exacerbated it.</p>
<p>They succeeded. In 1959, President <a href="/wiki/Sukarno.html" title="Sukarno">Soekarno</a> approved <a href="/wiki/PP_10/1959.html" title="PP 10/1959">PP 10/1959</a> that forced Chinese Indonesian to close their businesses in rural areas and relocate into urban areas in the hope of giving a competitive advantage for the <i>pribumi</i>s to open their businesses in rural areas as the economy was agriculture driven. This upset many Chinese Indonesian. They felt betrayed that their nationalism and heroism were not reckoned with at all. Moreover, the enforcement was brutal; many of them were slaughtered in the effort.</p>
<p>Many <i>Cina Totok</i>s "returned home" in protest to either mainland China, Hong Kong, or Taiwan, only to find that they were not as welcomed there either. Ironically, they were not regarded as "pure Chinese" regardless of their effort of maintaining "pure Chinese breed". The unfortunate news of the early migrants was widespread among the ones in Indonesia. They soon found themselves as neither Indonesian nor Chinese and thus were in deep identity crisis. Some decided to move some other places, like Singapore or Malaysia, but some uneasily decided to stay in Indonesia. &lt;--end add--&gt;</p>

<h3>New Order to Early Reform (1965-2000)</h3>
<p>By the time <a href="/wiki/Suharto.html" title="Suharto">Soeharto</a> came to power, Chinese Indonesian were increasingly discriminated against. With the pretense of denouncing Chinese communism, Soeharto not only closed communist-leaning parties, but also extended his reach toward all Chinese Indonesian parties and all aspects of Chinese Indonesian socio-culture. Soeharto effectively stripped off Chinese Indonesian of power, banned them from politics and military. He championed forced assimilation policy against Chinese Indonesian so that they would forget their ties to China. This policy spring forth many <a href="/wiki/Anti-Chinese_legislation_in_Indonesia.html" title="Anti-Chinese legislation in Indonesia">anti Chinese legislations</a>. Soeharto passed and enacted very discriminatory citizenship laws, such as forcing Chinese Indonesian to reregister themselves as Indonesian citizens by renouncing their alleged Chinese citizenship regardless of the validity of the Indonesian citizenship they may already have. He denounced Chinese cultures and banned Chinese characters and literature. Allegedly, Soeharto was also the mastermind of 1965 slaughter of millions of Chinese Indonesian, purportedly to eradicate <a href="/wiki/Communist_Party_of_Indonesia.html" title="Communist Party of Indonesia">Communist Party of Indonesia</a> (PKI).</p>
<p>Group divisions among <i>Cina Baba</i>s, <i>Qiao Sheng</i>s, and <i>Cina Totok</i>s were blurred because Soeharto treated them alike. They were all <a href="/wiki/127/U/Kep/12/1966.html" title="127/U/Kep/12/1966">forced to change their names</a> to <a href="/wiki/Indonesian-sounding_name_adopted_by_Indonesian_Chinese.html" title="Indonesian-sounding name adopted by Indonesian Chinese">Indonesian sounding ones</a>. This law is considered as one of the most humiliating ones to Chinese community in Indonesia since by doing so, they are forced to lose their family name. Between 1965 to 1975, army and police officers were rampant in abusing Chinese Indonesian, such as openly robbing and raping their families without due justice. During this time, police may abuse any people using Chinese language. The only measure to survive during this harsh period was by using bribes.</p>
<p>In addition, those who were considered as heroes of Indonesian independence, such as <a  class="new" title="Siauw Giok Tjhan">Siauw Giok Tjhan</a> and <a  class="new" title="Liem Koen Hian">Liem Koen Hian</a>, were either brutally executed, exiled, or jailed. Those who protested were silently murdered. None of them were bestowed national hero status. It effectively discouraged any Chinese Indonesian of the time to dedicate their lifes for Indonesia.</p>
<p>Since Chinese Indonesian were banned from all aspects of life except from economy and industry, they concentrated their effort in those areas and became remarkably successful. It opened opportunities for government and military officers to levy bribes from Chinese Indonesian businessmen. Bribes and corruption soon became a norm. This widened the gap between them and <i>pribumi</i>s. The <i>pribumi</i>s accused Chinese Indonesian colluding with the government and thereby poisoning the entire political system. On the other hand, Chinese Indonesian felt that they were treated unfairly and the government was much more lenient toward the <i>pribumi</i>s.</p>
<p>As more and more discrimination and enmity heaped up, Chinese Indonesian increasingly identified themselves as a separate group and did not like to be called as "Indonesians". Although younger generations did not as strictly followed traditions as the older ones, they still felt they were different from Indonesians.</p>
<p>During this era, younger generations adopted western culture more and more as they perceived it as being more superior. They were more aligned toward western countries such as <a href="/wiki/United_States.html" title="United States">United States</a> or <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom.html" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>. The westernization became so popular as many parents sent their children abroad to western countries.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Jakarta_Riots_of_May_1998.html" title="Jakarta Riots of May 1998">Jakarta riot of 1998</a> targeted many Chinese Indonesian. The riot itself drew condemnations from Chinese speaking countries. Soeharto was allegedly the mastermind of this riot, but it misfired. Suffering from lootings and arsons, many Chinese Indonesian fled from Indonesia. Ironically, they found western countries were more accepting than Indonesia, the country they were born. Even after the riot subsided, many of them did not want to return.</p>
<p>Those who decided to stay in Indonesia found a huge relief as Soeharto stepped down as president. They never forget the two genocidal riots associated with him, the ones in 1965 and 1998. They hoped that the new president would restore their status and ended the enmity of centuries long.</p>
<p>Early in the reform era, the government focused on stabilizing the economy and security. Discrimination was still rampant. However, Chinese Indonesian gained courage to express themselves in limited ways, which were otherwise impossible in Soeharto era in fear of his heavy-handed tactics. Unfortunately, there were still many officers loyal to Soeharto who enforced the discriminatory laws. It was not for the ideology sake, but rather for their own benefits.</p>

<h3>Recent history, post-Reformasi Era</h3>
<p>The condition for Chinese Indonesian has improved, with new government regulations that allow the practice of Chinese cultures without prior limitations, and efforts to improve race relationships. The Chinese culture is starting to be embraced by even the popular media, widely covering <a href="/wiki/Chinese_New_Year.html" title="Chinese New Year">Chinese New Year</a> celebrations and even TV shows on <a href="/wiki/Feng_Shui.html" title="Feng Shui">Feng Shui</a>. The formerly derogatory term referring to Chinese Indonesians -- <i>Cina</i> -- is slowly being replaced by the old term <i>Tionghoa</i>. A small number of Chinese Indonesian are now involved in Indonesian politics, one of whom (<a href="/wiki/Kwik_Kian_Gie.html" title="Kwik Kian Gie">Kwik Kian Gie</a>) was appointed minister in 1999.</p>
<p>The reversal of key discriminating laws which were intended to force assimilation into the local culture means that the Chinese Indonesian are now in an era of re-discovery. <a href="/wiki/Mandarin_%28linguistics%29.html" title="Mandarin (linguistics)">Mandarin</a> language lessons are widely available and are popular not only among the Chinese Indonesian. Mandarin has become a popular foreign language option in Indonesian schools. Attending an extensive program in a language school in <a href="/wiki/Beijing.html" title="Beijing">Beijing</a> or other cities is also a popular option for many Chinese Indonesian who were barred from learning Chinese during their formative years.</p>
<p>Soon after <a href="/wiki/Abdurrahman_Wahid.html" title="Abdurrahman Wahid">Abdurrahman Wahid</a> came into power, he quickly abolished some of the discriminatory laws. He encouraged Chinese Indonesian literature and culture. He also designated <a href="/wiki/Chinese_New_Year.html" title="Chinese New Year">Chinese lunar new year</a> as national holiday. This was warmly welcomed by many Chinese Indonesian.</p>
<p>Chinese Indonesian are now in the era of rediscovery. Many younger generations choose to learn Mandarin as many learning centers open throughout the country. Many of them can not speak Mandarin due to the ban decades earlier. Stores now can openly show Chinese characters. <a href="/wiki/Dragon_dance.html" title="Dragon dance">Dragon dances</a> and <a href="/wiki/Lion_dance.html" title="Lion dance">Lion dances</a> are shown in public in many places without special permits or supervisions. Some of them regained the courage to get involved in politics and created new political parties. Chinese Indonesian adopted the term <i>Tionghoa</i> (Zhong Hua, 中华, Central Glory) to identify themselves. The term <i>Cina</i> is deemed derogatory today due to unfortunate derogatory use in the past. Many of them believe that they are now one distinct part of Indonesia.</p>
