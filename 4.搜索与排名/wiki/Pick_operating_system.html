<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>A Pick database is divided into one or more accounts, then into files, records, fields, sub-fields and sub-sub-fields. Although historically in Pick, records are called items, fields are called attributes, sub-fields are called values or multivalues (hence the present-day label "multivalued database") and sub-sub-fields are called sub-values . The sub-sub-field, sub-field, field and record levels of this structure are marked-off by certain special delimiters as opposed to being fixed-length entities. Thus any file, record, or field may contain any number of entries of the lower level of entity.</p>
<p>In its initial implementation, Pick records were limited to 32K bytes in total, although this limit was removed in the <a href="/wiki/1980.html" title="1980">1980s</a>. Each record has a unique, primary key which is necessary to read or write the record. A record is retrieved by <a href="/wiki/Hashing.html" title="Hashing">hashing</a> this key and this hash value specifies which of a set of discrete "buckets" to look in, sequentially, for the record. This same method is used to write the record back to its correct "bucket". Each file may be split into as many buckets as the database engineer wishes, although changing this later may (in some versions) require the database to be quiescent. All files start as a contiguous group of disk pages, and grow by linking additional "overflow" pages from unused disk space. Although in the initial implementations there were no index structures or sequential files, this was later corrected to allow these types of structures as well. Files include a "dictionary" fork, and the items in the dictionary fork serve as definitions for the names and structure of the items in the data fork. The dictionary is optional, the system does not use the contents of the dictionary to ensure the integrity of the file as some other file-systems do; rather it is used only for the reporting tool. A Pick database has no data typing since all data is stored as characters, including numbers (which are stored as character decimal digits). Integrity rather than being controlled by the system, is controlled by the applications and the discipline of the programmers.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: History">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="History" id="History"></a></p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Pick was originally implemented as the Generalized Information Retrieval Language System (GIRLS) on an <a href="/wiki/IBM.html" title="IBM">IBM</a> <a href="/wiki/System/360.html" title="System/360">System/360</a> in 1965 by <a  class="new" title="Don Nelson (computer scientist)">Don Nelson</a> and <a  class="new" title="Richard Pick">Dick Pick</a> at <a href="/wiki/TRW.html" title="TRW">TRW</a> for use by the <a href="/wiki/U.S._Army.html" title="U.S. Army">U.S. Army</a> to control the inventory of <a href="/wiki/Helicopter.html" title="Helicopter">helicopter</a> parts. Pick was subsequently commercially released in 1973 by <a  class="new" title="Microdata">Microdata</a> (and their British distributor <a href="/wiki/CMC.html" title="CMC">CMC</a>) as the <a  class="new" title="Reality Operating System">Reality Operating System</a>.</p>
<p>On the Microdata implementation, a <a href="/wiki/BASIC_programming_language.html" title="BASIC programming language">BASIC</a>-like language called Data/BASIC with numerous syntax extensions for database operations was the primary programming language for applications. A <a href="/wiki/PROC_procedure_language.html" title="PROC procedure language">PROC procedure language</a> was provided for executing <a href="/wiki/Scripts.html" title="Scripts">scripts</a>. A <a href="/wiki/SQL.html" title="SQL">SQL</a>-style language called <a href="/wiki/English_programming_language.html" title="English programming language">ENGLISH</a> allowed database retrieval and reporting, but not updates. ENGLISH did not fully allow manipulation of the 3-dimensional multivalued structure of data records, nor did it directly provide common <a href="/wiki/Relational.html" title="Relational">relational</a> capabilities such as <a href="/wiki/Join_%28SQL%29.html" title="Join (SQL)">joins</a> because powerful <a href="/wiki/Data_dictionary.html" title="Data dictionary">data dictionary</a> redefinitions for a field allowed <a href="/wiki/Join_%28SQL%29.html" title="Join (SQL)">joins</a> via the execution of a calculated lookup in another file. The system included a <a href="/wiki/Spooler.html" title="Spooler">spooler</a>. A simple <a href="/wiki/Text_editor.html" title="Text editor">text editor</a> for file-system records was provided, but the editor was only suitable for system maintenance, and could not lock records, so most applications were written with the other tools such as Batch, RPL, or the BASIC compiler so as to ensure data validation and allow <a href="/wiki/Record_locking.html" title="Record locking">record locking</a>.</p>
<p>Dick Pick eventually founded <a  class="new" title="Pick &amp; Associates">Pick &amp; Associates</a>, later renamed <a  class="new" title="Pick Systems">Pick Systems</a> and currently called <a  class="new" title="Raining Data">Raining Data</a>, and licensed what was now called "Pick" to a large variety of manufacturers and vendors who have produced different "flavors" of Pick. The database flavor sold by Raining Data is now known as D3, and those sold by <a href="/wiki/IBM.html" title="IBM">IBM</a> under the "U2" umbrella are known as UniData and Universe. Dick Pick died of stroke complications in October <a href="/wiki/1994.html" title="1994">1994</a>.</p>
<p>Pick Systems was often tangled in licensing litigation, and relatively little effort was devoted to marketing and improving the software. Subsequent ports of Pick to other platforms generally offered the same tools and capabilities for many years, usually with relatively minor improvements and simply renamed (for example, Data/BASIC became <a  class="new" title="Pick/BASIC">Pick/BASIC</a> and ENGLISH became <a href="/wiki/Access_query_language.html" title="Access query language">ACCESS</a>). Licensees often developed proprietary variations and enhancements (for example, Microdata created their own input processor called <a  class="new" title="ScreenPro">ScreenPro</a>). The resulting fragmented plethora of non-standard implementations caused the various Pick systems to wander ineffectively while the rest of the industry moved forward. As a result, Pick is no longer as popular or successful or discussed as it once was. Yet, Pick still commands an enthusiastic user following of dedicated professionals who recognize that its robust data model, ease of use, scalability and language/opsys integration provide a productive environment found nowhere else. Major corporations using Pick in its various flavors include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/wiki/Standard_%26_Poor%27s.html" title="Standard &amp; Poor's">Standard &amp; Poor's</a>, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies</li>

<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Derivative and related products">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Derivative_and_related_products" id="Derivative_and_related_products"></a></p>
<h2>Derivative and related products</h2>
<p>What most characterizes Pick is the design and features of the database and the associated retrieval language. The Pick database evolved into derivatives and also inspired similar systems, of which a few examples are:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Reality&#160;</dt>
<dd>The first implementation of the Pick database was on a Microdata platform and called "Reality". The first commercial release was in 1973. The Microdata implementations ran in firmware, so each upgrade had to be accompanied by a new chip. Microdata itself was eventually bought by McDonnell-Douglas Information Systems. Pick and Microdata sued each other for the right to market the database, the final judgement being that they both had the right. In addition to the Reality series of computers, Microdata sold the Sequel series which was a much larger class able to handle 200 simultaneous users. The modern version of the original Pick implementation is owned and distributed by <a  class="external text" title="http://www.northgate-is.com/products__software_services/reality.php">Northgate Information Solutions</a>.</dd>
<dt>Ultimate&#160;</dt>
<dd>The second implementation of the Pick database was developed in about 1978 by a <a href="/wiki/New_Jersey.html" title="New Jersey">New Jersey</a> company called Ultimate, run by <a  class="new" title="Ted Sabarese">Ted Sabarese</a>. This was the first implemenation to be done in software only, so upgrades were accomplished by a tape load, rather than a new chip. It enjoyed moderate success during the 1980s, and even included an implemention running as a layer on top of the <a href="/wiki/MicroVAX.html" title="MicroVAX">MicroVAX</a>.</dd>
<dt>Prime INFORMATION&#160;</dt>
<dd><a  class="new" title="Devcom">Devcom</a>, a Microdata reseller, wrote a Pick-style database system in <a href="/wiki/FORTRAN.html" title="FORTRAN">FORTRAN</a> in 1979 called Prime INFORMATION, which was eventually sold to <a href="/wiki/Prime_Computer.html" title="Prime Computer">Prime Computer</a>, which later sold the technology to <a  class="new" title="Vmark Software">Vmark Software</a>. INFO-BASIC, a variant of Dartmouth <a href="/wiki/BASIC.html" title="BASIC">BASIC</a>, was used for database applications.</dd>
<dt><a href="/wiki/UniVerse.html" title="UniVerse">UniVerse</a>&#160;</dt>
<dd>Another implementation of the system was by <a  class="new" title="VMark Software">VMark Software</a>. This was the first one to incorporate the ability to emulate other implementations of the system, such as Microdata's <a  class="new" title="Reality Operating System">Reality Operating System</a>, and Prime Information. Originally running on <a href="/wiki/UNIX.html" title="UNIX">UNIX</a>, it was later also made available for <a href="/wiki/Microsoft_Windows.html" title="Microsoft Windows">Windows</a>. It now is owned and distributed by IBM. (The systems developed by Prime and VMark are now owned by <a href="/wiki/IBM.html" title="IBM">IBM</a> and referred to as "U2".)</dd>
<dt><a href="/wiki/UniData.html" title="UniData">UniData</a>&#160;</dt>
<dd>Very similar to UniVerse. UniData is a multi-valued Pick-style database. It is also owned and distributed by IBM.</dd>
<dt>Revelation&#160;</dt>
<dd>In 1984 <a href="/wiki/Revelation_Software.html" title="Revelation Software">Cosmos</a> released a Pick-style database called <a href="/wiki/Revelation_BASIC_programming_language.html" title="Revelation BASIC programming language">Revelation</a> for <a href="/wiki/DOS.html" title="DOS">DOS</a> on the <a href="/wiki/IBM_PC.html" title="IBM PC">IBM PC</a>.</dd>
<dt>jBASE&#160;</dt>
<dd><a href="/wiki/JBASE.html" title="JBASE">jBASE</a> was released in 1991 by a small company of the same name located in Hemel Hempstead, England. Written by former Microdata engineers, <a href="/wiki/JBASE.html" title="JBASE">jBASE</a> emulates all implementations of the system to some degree. <a href="/wiki/JBASE.html" title="JBASE">jBASE</a> is unique in that it compiles applications to native machine code form, rather than to an intermediate byte code.</dd>
<dt>UniVision&#160;</dt>
<dd>A Pick-style database by <a  class="external text" title="http://www.edp.co.uk/solutions/sol_univision.html">EDP</a>.</dd>
<dt><a href="/wiki/OpenQM.html" title="OpenQM">OpenQM</a>&#160;</dt>
<dd>OpenQM is the only multi-value database product available both as a fully supported non-open source commercial product and in open source form under the General Public Licence. It is available from <a  class="external text" title="http://openqm.com/">OpenQM</a>.</dd>
<dt>Caché&#160;</dt>
<dd>In 2005 <a href="/wiki/InterSystems.html" title="InterSystems">InterSystems</a>, the maker of <a href="/wiki/Cach%C3%A9_%28software%29.html" title="Caché (software)">Caché</a> database, announced support for a broad set of multi-value extensions in Caché. <a  class="external text" title="http://www.intersystems.com/mv/index.html">Caché for MultiValue</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Through the implementations above, and others, Pick-like systems became available as database/programming/emulation environments running under many variants of <a href="/wiki/UNIX.html" title="UNIX">UNIX</a> and <a href="/wiki/Microsoft_Windows.html" title="Microsoft Windows">Windows</a>.</p>
<p>Over the years, many important and widely used <a  class="new" title="Pick Applications">applications</a> have been written using Pick or one of the derivative implementations. In general, the end users of these applications are unaware of the underlying Pick implementation.</p>
<p>The Pick OS invites comparison with <a href="/wiki/MUMPS.html" title="MUMPS">MUMPS</a>. Similarities include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Both systems are built on the efficient implementation of large, sparse, string-indexed arrays;</li>
<li>Both comingle the language and the OS;</li>
<li>Both have a similar domain of applicability.</li>
</ul>
