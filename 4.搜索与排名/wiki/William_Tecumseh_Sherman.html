<h2>Early life</h2>
<p>Sherman was born <b>Tecumseh Sherman</b> in <a href="/wiki/Lancaster%2C_Ohio.html" title="Lancaster, Ohio">Lancaster, Ohio</a>, near the shores of the Hockhocking River (now the <a href="/wiki/Hocking_River.html" title="Hocking River">Hocking</a>). He was named <a href="/wiki/Tecumseh.html" title="Tecumseh">Tecumseh</a> after the famous <a href="/wiki/Shawnee_%28tribe%29.html" title="Shawnee (tribe)">Shawnee</a> leader. His father, <a href="/wiki/Charles_Robert_Sherman.html" title="Charles Robert Sherman">Charles Robert Sherman</a>, was a successful lawyer who sat on the <a href="/wiki/Ohio_Supreme_Court.html" title="Ohio Supreme Court">Ohio Supreme Court</a>. Judge Sherman died unexpectedly in 1829, leaving his widow, Mary Hoyt Sherman, with eleven children and no inheritance. Following this tragedy the nine-year-old Tecumseh was taken in and raised by a Lancaster neighbor and family friend, attorney <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Ewing.html" title="Thomas Ewing">Thomas Ewing</a>, a prominent member of the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Whig_Party.html" title="United States Whig Party">Whig Party</a> who served as <a href="/wiki/United_States_Senate.html" title="United States Senate">Senator</a> for Ohio and as the first <a href="/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_the_Interior.html" title="United States Secretary of the Interior">Secretary of the Interior</a>.</p>
<p>Ewing's wife, Maria, a Roman Catholic of Irish descent, insisted that Sherman be baptized <a href="/wiki/Roman_Catholic.html" title="Roman Catholic">Roman Catholic</a>. On that occasion a <a href="/wiki/Dominican_Order.html" title="Dominican Order">Dominican</a> priest bestowed upon him the name of William (chosen because the baptism occurred on <a href="/wiki/June_25.html" title="June 25">June 25</a>, the feast day of <a href="/wiki/William_of_Montevergine.html" title="William of Montevergine">Saint William of Vercelli</a>).

<p>He also never completely accepted the name "William" and friends and family always called him "Cump."<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a  title="">[3]</a></sup> One of his younger brothers, <a href="/wiki/John_Sherman_%28politician%29.html" title="John Sherman (politician)">John Sherman</a>, would become a <a href="/wiki/U.S._Senator.html" title="U.S. Senator">U.S. Senator</a> and the sponsor of the <a href="/wiki/Sherman_Antitrust_Act.html" title="Sherman Antitrust Act">Sherman Antitrust Act</a>.</p>

<p>Senator Ewing secured the appointment of the 16-year-old Sherman as a cadet in the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Military_Academy.html" title="United States Military Academy">United States Military Academy</a> at <a href="/wiki/West_Point%2C_New_York.html" title="West Point, New York">West Point</a>.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a  title="">[4]</a></sup> There Sherman excelled academically, but treated the demerit system with indifference. Fellow cadet <a href="/wiki/William_Rosecrans.html" title="William Rosecrans">William Rosecrans</a> would later remember Sherman at West Point as "one of the brightest and most popular fellows," and "a bright-eyed, <a href="/wiki/Red_hair.html" title="Red hair">red-headed</a> fellow, who was always prepared for a lark of any kind."<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a  title="">[5]</a></sup> About his time at West Point, Sherman says only the following in his <i>Memoirs</i>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At the Academy I was not considered a good soldier, for at no time was I selected for any office, but remained a private throughout the whole four years. Then, as now, neatness in dress and form, with a strict conformity to the rules, were the qualifications required for office, and I suppose I was found not to excel in any of these. In studies I always held a respectable reputation with the professors, and generally ranked among the best, especially in drawing, chemistry, mathematics, and natural philosophy. My average demerits, <i>per annum</i>, were about one hundred and fifty, which reduced my final class standing from number four to six.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a  title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Upon graduation in 1840, Sherman entered the Army as a <a href="/wiki/Second_lieutenant.html" title="Second lieutenant">second lieutenant</a> in the 3rd U.S. Artillery and saw action in <a href="/wiki/Florida.html" title="Florida">Florida</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Second_Seminole_War.html" title="Second Seminole War">Second Seminole War</a> against the <a href="/wiki/Seminole_%28tribe%29.html" title="Seminole (tribe)">Seminole</a> tribe. He was later stationed in <a href="/wiki/Georgia_%28U.S._State%29.html" title="Georgia (U.S. State)">Georgia</a> and <a href="/wiki/South_Carolina.html" title="South Carolina">South Carolina</a>. As the foster son of a prominent Whig politician, in <a href="/wiki/Charleston%2C_South_Carolina.html" title="Charleston, South Carolina">Charleston</a>, the popular Lt. Sherman moved within the upper circles of <a href="/wiki/Old_South.html" title="Old South">Old South</a> society.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a  title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>While many of his colleagues saw action in the <a href="/wiki/Mexican_American_War.html" title="Mexican American War">Mexican War</a>, Sherman performed administrative duties in the captured territory of <a href="/wiki/California.html" title="California">California</a>. He and fellow officer Lt. <a href="/wiki/Edward_Ord.html" title="Edward Ord">Edward Ord</a> reached the town of Yerba Buena two days before its name was changed to <a href="/wiki/San_Francisco%2C_California.html" title="San Francisco, California">San Francisco</a>. In 1848, Sherman accompanied the military governor of California, Col. <a href="/wiki/Richard_Barnes_Mason.html" title="Richard Barnes Mason">Richard Barnes Mason</a>, in the inspection that officially confirmed the claim that <a href="/wiki/Gold.html" title="Gold">gold</a> had been discovered in the region, thus inaugurating the <a href="/wiki/California_Gold_Rush.html" title="California Gold Rush">California Gold Rush</a>.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a  title="">[8]</a></sup> Sherman earned a <a href="/wiki/Brevet_%28military%29.html" title="Brevet (military)">brevet</a> promotion to <a href="/wiki/Captain.html" title="Captain">captain</a> for his "meritorious service," but his lack of a combat assignment discouraged him and may have contributed to his decision to resign his commission. Sherman would become one of the relatively few high-ranking officers in the Civil War who had not fought in Mexico.</p>

<h3>Marriage and business career</h3>
<p>In 1850, Sherman married Thomas Ewing's daughter, Eleanor Boyle ("Ellen") Ewing. Ellen was, like her mother, a devout Catholic and their eight children were raised in that faith. To Sherman's great displeasure and sorrow, one of his sons, <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Ewing_Sherman.html" title="Thomas Ewing Sherman">Thomas Ewing Sherman</a>, was ordained a <a href="/wiki/Society_of_Jesus.html" title="Society of Jesus">Jesuit</a> priest in 1879. Thomas would preside over his father's funeral mass in 1891.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a  title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 1853, Sherman resigned his military commission and became president of a bank in <a href="/wiki/San_Francisco%2C_California.html" title="San Francisco, California">San Francisco</a>. He returned to San Francisco at a time of great turmoil in the West. He survived two shipwrecks and floated through the <a href="/wiki/Golden_Gate.html" title="Golden Gate">Golden Gate</a> on the scraps of a foundering lumber schooner.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a  title="">[10]</a></sup> Sherman eventually suffered from stress-related <a href="/wiki/Asthma.html" title="Asthma">asthma</a> due to the city's brutal financial climate.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a  title="">[11]</a></sup> Late in life, regarding his time in real-estate-speculation-mad San Francisco, Sherman recalled: "I can handle a hundred thousand men in battle, and take the City of the Sun, but am afraid to manage a lot in the swamp of San Francisco."<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a  title="">[12]</a></sup> In 1856 he served as a <a href="/wiki/Major_general.html" title="Major general">major general</a> of the California <a href="/wiki/Militia.html" title="Militia">militia</a>.</p>
<p>Sherman's bank failed during the financial <a href="/wiki/Panic_of_1857.html" title="Panic of 1857">panic of 1857</a> and he turned to the practice of law in <a href="/wiki/Leavenworth%2C_Kansas.html" title="Leavenworth, Kansas">Leavenworth, Kansas</a>, at which he was also unsuccessful.<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a  title="">[13]</a></sup></p>

<h3>University superintendent</h3>
<p>In 1859 Sherman accepted a job as the first superintendent of the <a href="/wiki/Louisiana.html" title="Louisiana">Louisiana</a> State Seminary of Learning and Military Academy in <a href="/wiki/Pineville%2C_Louisiana.html" title="Pineville, Louisiana">Pineville</a>, a position offered to him by two of his Army friends from the <a href="/wiki/Southern_United_States.html" title="Southern United States">South</a>: <a href="/wiki/P.G.T._Beauregard.html" title="P.G.T. Beauregard">P.G.T. Beauregard</a> and <a href="/wiki/Braxton_Bragg.html" title="Braxton Bragg">Braxton Bragg</a>.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a  title="">[14]</a></sup> He proved an effective and popular leader of that institution, which would later become <a href="/wiki/Louisiana_State_University.html" title="Louisiana State University">Louisiana State University</a>.

<dd>You people of the South don't know what you are doing. This country will be drenched in blood, and God only knows how it will end. It is all folly, madness, a crime against civilization! You people speak so lightly of war; you don't know what you're talking about. War is a terrible thing!</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>You mistake, too, the people of the North. They are a peaceable people but an earnest people, and they will fight, too. They are not going to let this country be destroyed without a mighty effort to save it ...</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Besides, where are your men and appliances of war to contend against them? The North can make a steam engine, locomotive, or railway car; hardly a yard of cloth or pair of shoes can you make. You are rushing into war with one of the most powerful, ingeniously mechanical, and determined people on Earth—right at your doors.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>You are bound to fail. Only in your spirit and determination are you prepared for war. In all else you are totally unprepared, with a bad cause to start with. At first you will make headway, but as your limited resources begin to fail, shut out from the markets of Europe as you will be, your cause will begin to wane. If your people will but stop and think, they must see in the end that you will surely fail.<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a  title="">[16]</a></sup></dd>

<h3>Breakdown and Shiloh</h3>
<p>During his time in Louisville, Sherman became increasingly pessimistic about the outlook of the war and repeatedly made estimates of the strength of the rebel forces that proved exaggerated, causing the local press to describe him as "crazy." In the fall of 1861, Sherman experienced what would probably be described today as a <a href="/wiki/Nervous_breakdown.html" title="Nervous breakdown">nervous breakdown</a>. He was put on leave and returned to Ohio to recuperate, being replaced in his command by <a href="/wiki/Don_Carlos_Buell.html" title="Don Carlos Buell">Don Carlos Buell</a>. While he was at home, his wife, Ellen, wrote to his brother Senator John Sherman seeking advice and complaining of "that melancholy insanity to which your family is subject."<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a  title="">[19]</a></sup> However, Sherman quickly recovered and returned to service under Maj. Gen. <a href="/wiki/Henry_W._Halleck.html" title="Henry W. Halleck">Henry W. Halleck</a>, commander of the Department of the Missouri. Halleck's department had just won a major victory at <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Fort_Henry.html" title="Battle of Fort Henry">Fort Henry</a>, but he harbored doubts about the commander in the field, Brig. Gen. <a href="/wiki/Ulysses_S._Grant.html" title="Ulysses S. Grant">Ulysses S. Grant</a>, and his plans to capture <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Fort_Donelson.html" title="Battle of Fort Donelson">Fort Donelson</a>. Unbeknownst to Grant, Halleck offered several officers, including Sherman, command of Grant's army. Sherman refused, saying he preferred serving <i>under</i> Grant, even though he outranked him. Sherman wrote to Grant from <a href="/wiki/Paducah%2C_Kentucky.html" title="Paducah, Kentucky">Paducah</a>, "Command me in any way. I feel anxious about you as I know the great facilities [the Confederates] have of concentration by means of the river and railroad, but [I] have faith in you."<sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a  title="">[20]</a></sup></p>
<p>After Grant was promoted to major general in command of the District of West Tennessee, Sherman served briefly as his replacement in command of the District of Cairo. He got his wish of serving under Grant when he was assigned on <a href="/wiki/March_1.html" title="March 1">March 1</a>, <a href="/wiki/1862.html" title="1862">1862</a> to the <a href="/wiki/Army_of_West_Tennessee.html" title="Army of West Tennessee">Army of West Tennessee</a> as commander of the 5th <a href="/wiki/Division_%28military%29.html" title="Division (military)">Division</a>.<sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a  title="">[21]</a></sup> His first major test under Grant was at the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Shiloh.html" title="Battle of Shiloh">Battle of Shiloh</a>. The massive Confederate attack on the morning of <a href="/wiki/April_6.html" title="April 6">April 6</a> took most of the senior Union commanders by surprise. Sherman in particular had dismissed the intelligence reports that he had received from militia officers, refusing to believe that Confederate General <a href="/wiki/Albert_Sidney_Johnston.html" title="Albert Sidney Johnston">Albert Sidney Johnston</a> would leave his base at <a href="/wiki/Corinth%2C_Mississippi.html" title="Corinth, Mississippi">Corinth</a>. He took no precautions beyond strengthening his picket lines, refusing to entrench, build <a href="/wiki/Abatis.html" title="Abatis">abatis</a>, or push out reconnaissance patrols. At Shiloh, he may have wished to avoid appearing overly alarmed in order to escape the kind of criticism he had received in Kentucky. He had written to his wife that, if he took more precautions, "they'd call me crazy again."<sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a  title="">[22]</a></sup></p>
<p>Despite being caught unprepared by the attack, Sherman rallied his division and conducted an orderly, fighting retreat that helped avert a disastrous Union rout. Finding Grant at the end of the day sitting under an oak tree in the darkness smoking a cigar, he experienced, in his own words "some wise and sudden instinct not to mention retreat." Instead, in what would become one of the most famous conversations of the war, Sherman said simply: "Well, Grant, we've had the devil's own day, haven't we?" After a puff of his cigar, Grant replied calmly: "Yes. Lick 'em tomorrow, though."<sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a  title="">[23]</a></sup> Sherman would prove instrumental to the successful Union counterattack of <a href="/wiki/April_7.html" title="April 7">April 7</a>. Sherman was wounded twice —in the hand and shoulder— and had three horses shot out from under him. His performance was praised by Grant and Halleck and after the battle, he was promoted to <a href="/wiki/Major_general.html" title="Major general">major general</a> of volunteers, effective <a href="/wiki/May_1.html" title="May 1">May 1</a>.<sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a  title="">[24]</a></sup></p>

<p>Sherman developed close personal ties to Grant during the two years they served together. Shortly after Shiloh, Sherman persuaded Grant not to resign from the Army, despite the serious difficulties he was having with his commander, General Halleck. Sherman offered Grant an example from his own life, "Before the battle of Shiloh, I was cast down by a mere newspaper assertion of 'crazy', but that single battle gave me new life, and I'm now in high feather." He told Grant that, if he remained in the army, "some happy accident might restore you to favor and your true place."<sup id="_ref-24" class="reference"><a  title="">[25]</a></sup> The careers of both officers ascended considerably after that time.</p>
<p>Sherman's military record in 1862–63 was mixed. In December 1862, forces under his command suffered a severe repulse at the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Chickasaw_Bayou.html" title="Battle of Chickasaw Bayou">Battle of Chickasaw Bluffs</a>, just north of <a href="/wiki/Vicksburg%2C_Mississippi.html" title="Vicksburg, Mississippi">Vicksburg</a>.

McClernand</a> in his successful assault on <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Arkansas_Post.html" title="Battle of Arkansas Post">Arkansas Post</a>, generally regarded as a politically motivated distraction from the effort to capture Vicksburg.<sup id="_ref-25" class="reference"><a  title="">[26]</a></sup> Before the <a href="/wiki/Vicksburg_Campaign.html" title="Vicksburg Campaign">Vicksburg Campaign</a> in the spring of 1863, Sherman expressed serious reservations about the wisdom of Grant's unorthodox strategy<sup id="_ref-26" class="reference"><a  title="">[27]</a></sup>, but he went on to perform well in that campaign under Grant's supervision.</p>
<p>During the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Chattanooga_III.html" title="Battle of Chattanooga III">Battle of Chattanooga</a> in November, Sherman, now in command of the <a href="/wiki/Army_of_the_Tennessee.html" title="Army of the Tennessee">Army of the Tennessee</a>, quickly took his assigned target of Billy Goat Hill at the north end of Missionary Ridge, only to discover that it was not part of the ridge at all, but rather a detached spur separated from the main spine by a rock-strewn ravine. When he attempted to attack the main spine at Tunnel Hill, his troops were repeatedly repulsed by <a href="/wiki/Patrick_Cleburne.html" title="Patrick Cleburne">Patrick Cleburne</a>'s heavy division, the best unit in Braxton Bragg's army.<sup id="_ref-27" class="reference"><a  title="">[28]</a></sup> Sherman's effort was overshadowed by <a href="/wiki/George_Henry_Thomas.html" title="George Henry Thomas">George Henry Thomas</a>'s army's successful assault on the center of the Confederate line, a movement originally intended as a diversion.</p>
<p>Despite this mixed record, Sherman enjoyed Grant's confidence and friendship. In later years Sherman said simply, "Grant stood by me when I was crazy, and I stood by him when he was drunk. Now we stand by each other always."<sup id="_ref-28" class="reference"><a  title="">[29]</a></sup></p>

<p>When Lincoln called Grant east in the spring of 1864 to take command of all the Union armies, Grant appointed Sherman (by then known to his soldiers as "Uncle Billy") to succeed him as head of the <a href="/wiki/Military_Division_of_the_Mississippi.html" title="Military Division of the Mississippi">Military Division of the Mississippi</a>, which entailed command of Union troops in the <a href="/wiki/Western_Theater_of_the_American_Civil_War.html" title="Western Theater of the American Civil War">Western Theater</a> of the war.

<p>In the spring of 1865, Grant ordered Sherman to embark his army on steamers to join him against Lee in Virginia.

<p>General Sherman's record as a <a href="/wiki/Military_tactics.html" title="Military tactics">tactician</a> was mixed, and his military legacy rests primarily on his command of <a href="/wiki/Military_logistics.html" title="Military logistics">logistics</a> and on his brilliance as a <a href="/wiki/Military_strategy.html" title="Military strategy">strategist</a>. The influential 20th century British military historian and theorist <a href="/wiki/Basil_Liddell_Hart.html" title="Basil Liddell Hart">Basil Liddell Hart</a> ranked Sherman as one of the most important strategists in the annals of war, along with <a href="/wiki/Scipio_Africanus.html" title="Scipio Africanus">Scipio Africanus</a>, <a href="/wiki/Belisarius.html" title="Belisarius">Belisarius</a>, <a href="/wiki/Napoleon_I_of_France.html" title="Napoleon I of France">Napoleon Bonaparte</a>, <a href="/wiki/T.E._Lawrence.html" title="T.E.

Liddell Hart credited Sherman with mastery of <a href="/wiki/Maneuver_warfare.html" title="Maneuver warfare">maneuver warfare</a> (also known as the "indirect approach"), as demonstrated by his series of turning movements against Johnston during the Atlanta Campaign. Liddell Hart also stated that study of Sherman's campaigns had contributed significantly to his own "theory of strategy and tactics in <a href="/wiki/Armoured_warfare.html" title="Armoured warfare">mechanized warfare</a>," which had in turn influenced <a href="/wiki/Heinz_Guderian.html" title="Heinz Guderian">Heinz Guderian</a>'s doctrine of <i><a href="/wiki/Blitzkrieg.html" title="Blitzkrieg">Blitzkrieg</a></i> and Rommel's use of <a href="/wiki/Tank.html" title="Tank">tanks</a> during <a href="/wiki/World_War_II.html" title="World War II">World War II</a>.<sup id="_ref-39" class="reference"><a  title="">[40]</a></sup></p>
<p>Sherman's greatest contribution to the war, the strategy of <a href="/wiki/Total_war.html" title="Total war">total warfare</a>—endorsed by General Grant and President Lincoln—has been the subject of much controversy. Sherman himself downplayed his role in conducting total war, often saying that he was simply carrying out orders as best he could in order to fulfill his part of Grant's master plan for ending the war.</p>

<p>Like Grant, Sherman was convinced that the <a href="/wiki/Confederate_States_of_America.html" title="Confederate States of America">Confederacy</a>'s strategic, economic, and psychological ability to wage further war had to be definitively crushed if the fighting were to end. Therefore, he believed that the North had to conduct its campaign as a war of conquest and employ <a href="/wiki/Scorched_earth.html" title="Scorched earth">scorched earth</a> tactics to break the backbone of the rebellion.</p>
<p>Sherman's advance through Georgia and South Carolina was characterized by widespread destruction of civilian supplies and infrastructure, and sometimes accompanied by looting; although officially forbidden, historians disagree on how well this regulation was enforced.<sup id="_ref-40" class="reference"><a  title="">[41]</a></sup> The speed and efficiency of the destruction by Sherman's army was remarkable. The practice of bending rails around trees, leaving behind what came to be known as <a href="/wiki/Sherman%27s_neckties.html" title="Sherman's neckties">Sherman's neckties</a>, made repairs difficult. Accusations that civilians were targeted and <a href="/wiki/War_crime.html" title="War crime">war crimes</a> were committed on the march have made Sherman a controversial figure to this day, particularly in the <a href="/wiki/American_South.html" title="American South">South</a>.</p>

<p>The damage done by Sherman was almost entirely limited to the destruction of <a href="/wiki/Property.html" title="Property">property</a>. Though exact figures are not available, the loss of civilian life appears to have been very small.<sup id="_ref-41" class="reference"><a  title="">[42]</a></sup> Consuming supplies, wrecking infrastructure, and undermining morale were Sherman's stated goals, and several of his Southern contemporaries noted this and commented on it. For instance, <a href="/wiki/Alabama.html" title="Alabama">Alabama</a>-born Major Henry Hitchcock, who served in Sherman's staff, declared that "it is a terrible thing to consume and destroy the sustenance of thousands of people," but if the scorched earth strategy served "to paralyze their husbands and fathers who are fighting ... it is mercy in the end."<sup id="_ref-42" class="reference"><a  title="">[43]</a></sup></p>
<p>The severity of the destructive acts by Union troops was significantly greater in South Carolina than in Georgia or North Carolina. This appears to have been a consequence of the animosity among both Union soldiers and officers to the state that they regarded as the "cockpit of secession."<sup id="_ref-43" class="reference"><a  title="">[44]</a></sup> One of the most serious accusations against Sherman was that he allowed his troops to burn the city of Columbia. Historian <a href="/wiki/James_M._McPherson.html" title="James M. McPherson">James M. McPherson</a>, however, claims that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The fullest and most dispassionate study of this controversy blames all parties in varying proportions—including the Confederate authorities for the disorder that characterized the evacuation of Columbia, leaving thousands of cotton bales on the streets (some of them burning) and huge quantities of liquor undestroyed ... Sherman did not deliberately burn Columbia; a majority of Union soldiers, including the general himself, worked through the night to put out the fires.<sup id="_ref-44" class="reference"><a  title="">[45]</a></sup></p>

<h3>Modern assessment</h3>
<p>After the fall of Atlanta in 1864, Sherman ordered the city's evacuation. When the city council appealed to him to rescind that order, on the grounds that it would cause great hardship to women, children, the elderly, and others who bore no responsibility for the conduct of the war, Sherman sent a response in which he sought to articulate his conviction that a lasting peace would be possible only if the Union were restored, and that he was therefore prepared to do all he could legitimately do to quash the rebellion:</p>

<dd>You cannot qualify war in harsher terms than I will. War is cruelty, and you cannot refine it; and those who brought war into our country deserve all the curses and maledictions a people can pour out. I know I had no hand in making this war, and I know I will make more sacrifices to-day than any of you to secure peace. But you cannot have peace and a division of our country.

<p>Literary critic <a href="/wiki/Edmund_Wilson.html" title="Edmund Wilson">Edmund Wilson</a> found in Sherman's <i>Memoirs</i> a fascinating and disturbing account of an "appetite for warfare" that "grows as it feeds on the South."<sup id="_ref-46" class="reference"><a  title="">[47]</a></sup> Former <a href="/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_Defense.html" title="United States Secretary of Defense">U.S. Defense Secretary</a> <a href="/wiki/Robert_McNamara.html" title="Robert McNamara">Robert McNamara</a> refers equivocally to the statement that "war is cruelty and you cannot refine it" in both the book <i>Wilson's Ghost</i><sup id="_ref-47" class="reference"><a  title="">[48]</a></sup> and in his interview for the film <i><a href="/wiki/The_Fog_of_War.html" title="The Fog of War">The Fog of War</a></i>.

<p>In May 1865, after the major Confederate armies had surrendered, Sherman wrote in a personal letter:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I confess, without shame, that I am sick and tired of fighting—its glory is all moonshine; even success the most brilliant is over dead and mangled bodies, with the anguish and lamentations of distant families, appealing to me for sons, husbands, and fathers ... it is only those who have never heard a shot, never heard the shriek and groans of the wounded and lacerated ... that cry aloud for more blood, more vengeance, more desolation.<sup id="_ref-50" class="reference"><a  title="">[51]</a></sup></p>

<p>Sherman's main concern as commanding general was to protect the construction and operation of the <a href="/wiki/Railroad.html" title="Railroad">railroads</a> from attack by hostile Indians. In his campaigns against the Indian tribes, Sherman repeated his Civil War strategy by seeking not only to defeat the enemy's soldiers, but also to destroy the resources that allowed the enemy to sustain its warfare.

<p>In 1875 Sherman published his memoirs in two volumes. According to critic <a href="/wiki/Edmund_Wilson.html" title="Edmund Wilson">Edmund Wilson</a>, Sherman</p>
<blockquote>
<p>had a trained gift of self-expression and was, as <a href="/wiki/Mark_Twain.html" title="Mark Twain">Mark Twain</a> says, a master of narrative. [In his <i>Memoirs</i>] the vigorous account of his pre-war activities and his conduct of his military operations is varied in just the right proportion and to just the right degree of vivacity with anecdotes and personal experiences.

He tells us what he thought and what he felt, and he never strikes any attitudes or pretends to feel anything he does not feel.<sup id="_ref-53" class="reference"><a  title="">[54]</a></sup></p>

He lived most of the rest of his life in <a href="/wiki/New_York_City.html" title="New York City">New York City</a>.
