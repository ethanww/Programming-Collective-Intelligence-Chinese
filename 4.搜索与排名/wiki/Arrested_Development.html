<h2>Origins</h2>
<p>The discussions that led to the creation of the series began in the summer of 2002. <a href="/wiki/Ron_Howard.html" title="Ron Howard">Ron Howard</a> had the original idea to create a comedy in the style of hand-held cameras and reality television, but with an elaborate, highly comical script resulting from repeated rewritings and rehearsals. Howard met with <a  class="new" title="David Nevins">David Nevins</a>, the president of <a  class="new" title="Imagine Television">Imagine Television</a>; <a  class="new" title="Katie O’Connell">Katie O’Connell</a>, a senior vice president; and two writers including <a href="/wiki/Mitchell_Hurwitz.html" title="Mitchell Hurwitz">Mitchell Hurwitz</a>. In light of recent <a href="/wiki/Accounting_scandals.html" title="Accounting scandals">corporate accounting scandals</a>, such as <a href="/wiki/Enron_Corporation.html" title="Enron Corporation">Enron</a> and <a href="/wiki/Adelphia.html" title="Adelphia">Adelphia</a>, Hurwitz suggested a story about a "riches to rags" family. Howard and Imagine were immediately interested in using this idea, and signed Hurwitz on to write the show. The idea was pitched and sold in fall 2002. Over the next few months, Hurwitz developed the series' characters and plot. The <a href="/wiki/Television_pilot.html" title="Television pilot">pilot</a> script was submitted in January 2003, and filmed in March. The finished pilot was submitted in late April, and the series was added to the fall schedule in May.<sup id="_ref-OConnell_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[2]</a></sup></p>

<p>The plot of <i>Arrested Development</i> revolves around the members of the Bluth family, who generally lead excessive lifestyles. At the center of the show is the relatively honorable <a href="/wiki/Characters_from_Arrested_Development#Michael_Bluth.html" title="Characters from Arrested Development">Michael Bluth</a> (<a href="/wiki/Jason_Bateman.html" title="Jason Bateman">Jason Bateman</a>), who strives to do the right thing and keep his family together, despite their materialism, selfishness and manipulation. His teenage son, <a href="/wiki/Characters_from_Arrested_Development#George_Michael.html" title="Characters from Arrested Development">George Michael</a> (<a href="/wiki/Michael_Cera.html" title="Michael Cera">Michael Cera</a>), has the same qualities of decency, but feels a constant pressure to live up to his father's expectations, and is reluctantly willing to follow his father's plans, even if they sometimes conflict with his own.</p>
<p>--Michael's father <a href="/wiki/Characters_from_Arrested_Development#George_Bluth_Sr..html" title="Characters from Arrested Development">George Sr.</a> (<a href="/wiki/Jeffrey_Tambor.html" title="Jeffrey Tambor">Jeffrey Tambor</a>), the patriarch of the family, is the founder of the <a href="/wiki/Bluth_Company.html" title="Bluth Company">Bluth Company</a>, whose primary operations are building and marketing mini-mansions. At times dictatorial, George Sr. goes to considerable lengths to manipulate and control his family. His wife, and Michael's mother, <a href="/wiki/Characters_from_Arrested_Development#Lucille_Bluth.html" title="Characters from Arrested Development">Lucille</a> (<a href="/wiki/Jessica_Walter.html" title="Jessica Walter">Jessica Walter</a>), is equally manipulative, as well as materialistic, and hypercritical of every member of her family. In particular, she has a tight grip on her youngest son, <a href="/wiki/Characters_from_Arrested_Development#Byron_.22Buster.22_Bluth.html" title="Characters from Arrested Development">Byron "Buster" Bluth</a> (<a href="/wiki/Tony_Hale.html" title="Tony Hale">Tony Hale</a>), who, as a result of his mother's dominance and sheltering, is unstable, socially inept and prone to panic attacks.</p>
<p>--Michael's older brother <a href="/wiki/Characters_from_Arrested_Development#George_Oscar_.22G.O.B..22_Bluth_II.html" title="Characters from Arrested Development">Gob</a> (George Oscar Bluth II; pronounced <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/dʒoʊb/</span> "Jobe"), played by <a href="/wiki/Will_Arnett.html" title="Will Arnett">Will Arnett</a>, is an unsuccessful professional <a href="/wiki/Magic_%28illusion%29.html" title="Magic (illusion)">magician</a> whose business and personal schemes usually fail. He primarily uses a <a href="/wiki/Segway_HT.html" title="Segway HT">Segway</a> for transportation, and sometimes converses with others from it while stationary, as if it were a pulpit. Gob, constantly seeking validation of his father's love, is used by his father to undermine Michael's control of the family business. Michael's twin sister <a href="/wiki/Characters_from_Arrested_Development#Lindsay_Bluth.html" title="Characters from Arrested Development">Lindsay</a> (<a href="/wiki/Portia_de_Rossi.html" title="Portia de Rossi">Portia de Rossi</a>) is a self-proclaimed activist, who is flamboyant and materialistic, continually desiring to be the center of attention. She enjoys being objectified, but also protests it. She is married to <a href="/wiki/Characters_from_Arrested_Development#Tobias_F.C3.BCnke.html" title="Characters from Arrested Development">Tobias Fünke</a> (<a href="/wiki/David_Cross.html" title="David Cross">David Cross</a>), a "<a href="/wiki/Never_Nude.html" title="Never Nude">Never Nude</a>," who became an aspiring actor after his <a href="/wiki/Psychiatry.html" title="Psychiatry">psychiatrist's</a> license was revoked, and whose language and behavior often have inadvertent <a href="/wiki/Homosexuality.html" title="Homosexuality">homosexual</a> connotations. Their attention-starved daughter <a href="/wiki/Characters_from_Arrested_Development#Maeby_F.C3.BCnke.html" title="Characters from Arrested Development">Mae "Maeby" Fünke</a> (<a href="/wiki/Alia_Shawkat.html" title="Alia Shawkat">Alia Shawkat</a>) is the polar opposite of her cousin George Michael — skipping school, cheating on homework, and stealing money from the family's banana-stand business. The ever-rebellious teen, Maeby finds her chief motivation in going against her parents' wishes.</p>

<h3>Casting</h3>
<p>The most difficult part for casting the series involved finding people who would be believable as a family. Alia Shawkat was the first person cast. Michael Cera, Tony Hale, and Jessica Walter were cast from <a href="/wiki/Video_tape.html" title="Video tape">video tapes</a> and flown in to audition for Fox. Jason Bateman and Portia de Rossi both read and auditioned for the network, and were immediately chosen. The character of GOB was the most challenging to cast. When Will Arnett auditioned, he depicted the character in an interesting way, different from expectations; he was chosen immediately. The characters of Tobias and George Sr. were originally going to have minor roles, but David Cross's and Jeffrey Tambor's portrayals mixed well with the rest of the characters, and they were given more significant parts.<sup id="_ref-OConnell_1" class="reference"><a  title="">[2]</a></sup></p>

<p>Because of his father's latest lie about a heart attack, Michael decides to leave his family and company behind. Lucille appoints Gob to be the new Bluth Company president, but he proves incapable and the position reverts back to Michael (although Gob retains the figurehead title of president for some time). George Sr.'s <a href="/wiki/Twin.html" title="Twin">twin</a> brother Oscar (also played by <a href="/wiki/Jeffrey_Tambor.html" title="Jeffrey Tambor">Jeffrey Tambor</a>) moves in with Lucille in an attempt to rekindle a previous love affair.

He bonds with his uncle Oscar, who is revealed as Buster's presumptive biological father. George Michael begins dating a deeply religious girl, <a href="/wiki/Characters_from_Arrested_Development#Ann_Veal.html" title="Characters from Arrested Development">Ann Veal</a>; his father does not like her, and tries to disrupt their relationship. Michael fails to break them up, but George Michael sees a chance for his crush on Maeby to bear fruit, and the pair kiss while the living room of the model home collapses under them.</p>
<p>Maeby inadvertently cons her way into a film studio executive position. While helping her father spread the Fünke name around the studio to help him land a part, she bumps into Mort Meyers (<a href="/wiki/Jeff_Garlin.html" title="Jeff Garlin">Jeff Garlin</a>) who mistakes her for the Fünke everyone has been talking about. Tobias repeatedly paints himself blue in a futile attempt to join the <a href="/wiki/Blue_Man_Group.html" title="Blue Man Group">Blue Man Group</a>, originally believing them to be a support group for depressed men. Throughout the season, various blue paint marks can be seen around the family's house and on the back of Tobias's neck when not in full makeup.

This is an explicitly-narrated reference to <i><a href="/wiki/Mrs._Doubtfire.html" title="Mrs. Doubtfire">Mrs. Doubtfire</a></i>. Although it is obvious to the whole family that Tobias is in disguise, they enjoy using him to clean up after themselves. Kitty returns to steal a sample of George Sr.'s <a href="/wiki/Semen.html" title="Semen">semen</a> to make her own Bluth baby. George Sr., in revenge for twin brother Oscar's affair with his wife, exchanges appearances with an unconscious Oscar, who is mistakenly sent to prison in the place of George Sr., who flees again.</p>

<p>In the third season, Michael once again begins searching for his runaway father. Gob gets an invitation to a father/son reunion outing, and believes it to be George Sr. trying to contact him. In reality, the invitation was meant to reunite Gob with Steve Holt, son of Eve Holt, one of Gob's former intimate partners. Meanwhile, George Michael and Maeby deal with their previous kiss by avoiding each other.</p>
<p>George Sr., in an attempt to remain in disguise, joined the <a href="/wiki/Blue_Man_Group.html" title="Blue Man Group">Blue Man Group</a>. Michael discovers this, and arranges to have his father placed under <a href="/wiki/House_arrest.html" title="House arrest">house arrest</a>. George Sr. claims that he was set up by an underground British group. Michael goes to Wee Britain, a fictional British-themed city district, to investigate, and in the process meets new love interest Rita (<a href="/wiki/Charlize_Theron.html" title="Charlize Theron">Charlize Theron</a>). Michael and the audience are led to believe that Rita is a mole for the underground British group, working for a man named "Mr. F". In the end of the episode titled "Mr. F," it is revealed that Rita is actually an MRF, or "mentally retarded female". The unknowing Michael proposes to her, and the couple run off to be wed. Michael eventually finds out the truth, however, and the two decide to end their relationship just as they are about to walk down the aisle. Meanwhile, Tobias and Lindsay variously seek legal help from Bob Loblaw (<a href="/wiki/Scott_Baio.html" title="Scott Baio">Scott Baio</a>) concerning their troubled marriage.</p>
<p>In light of FOX's possible cancellation of the show, the first episode of 2006 parodied various <a href="/wiki/Gimmicks.html" title="Gimmicks">gimmicks</a> that other shows had used during November <a href="/wiki/Nielsen_Ratings#sweeps.html" title="Nielsen Ratings">sweeps</a> in 2005. Thinly-veiled allusions were made to the possibility of <a href="/wiki/Home_Box_Office.html" title="Home Box Office">HBO</a> or <a href="/wiki/Showtime_%28television%29.html" title="Showtime (television)">Showtime</a> picking the show up in the event of its cancellation. The episode took shots at frequently cited reasons for the show's failure in the ratings, such as complex storylines that are hard to follow, obscure references that may go over viewers' heads, and unlikeable, unrelatable main characters.</p>
<p>Disturbed by both Lindsay's and Tobias's advances, Bob Loblaw chooses to no longer represent the Bluth family. Attorney Jan Eagleman offers to represent the family, on the condition that they participate in a mock trial in a new reality courtroom show, presided over by <a href="/wiki/Judge_Reinhold.html" title="Judge Reinhold">Judge Reinhold</a>. Meanwhile, Maeby and George Michael perform in a mock wedding which is accidentally conducted by a real priest, and the two become legally married.</p>
<p>The family members are afraid to testify at the mock trial and deposition, so Buster fakes a coma, Lindsay and Lucille fake entering rehab, and Gob flees the country to perform in a <a href="/wiki/United_Service_Organizations.html" title="United Service Organizations">USO Tour</a> in Iraq. All of the deceptions are uncovered by the prosecution, and in Iraq, Gob is arrested for inadvertently inciting an anti-US riot. Buster and Michael travel to Iraq to rescue Gob, and while there, uncover evidence that the mini-palaces George Sr. built in Iraq were actually ordered and paid for by the CIA for wiretapping purposes. After this discovery, the US government drops all of the charges against George Sr..</p>
<p>To celebrate, the Bluths throw a shareholders' party on the <a href="/wiki/RMS_Queen_Mary.html" title="RMS Queen Mary">Queen Mary</a>. During the preparation of the party, it is revealed that Lindsay was an adopted child, meaning that George Michael and Maeby are not blood relatives. At the party, the Bluth's other adopted child, Annyong, reappears. He reveals that he is there to avenge his grandfather's deportation, an event orchestrated by Lucille Bluth. Annyong has turned over evidence implicating Lucille in the Bluth Company's accounting scandals. Before the police arrive, Michael and George Michael flee on GOB's yacht, the 'C-Word', and depart to Cabo with half a million dollars in cashier's checks, finally leaving the family to fend for themselves. However, it is revealed in the epilogue that George Sr. is also on the yacht, having lured his brother Oscar into taking his place once again. Also in the epilogue, Maeby tries to sell the television rights to the story of the Bluth family to <a href="/wiki/Ron_Howard.html" title="Ron Howard">Ron Howard</a>, who tells her that he sees it as a movie rather than a series.</p>

<h2>Themes and other characteristics</h2>
<p>The show focuses on the tension that developed between the members of the Bluth family, primarily from their diminished spending power. Each show pulls from a serpentine mix of sibling rivalries, unresolved <a href="/wiki/Oedipus_complex.html" title="Oedipus complex">oedipal</a> conflicts, sexual incompatibilities, personal <a href="/wiki/Identity_crisis_%28psychology%29.html" title="Identity crisis (psychology)">identity crises</a>, <a href="/wiki/Adolescence.html" title="Adolescence">adolescent</a> trauma, aging, pride, miscommunication, lying, <a href="/wiki/Guilt.html" title="Guilt">guilt</a>, subterfuge, determination, manipulation, mutilation, social status anxiety, incest taboo, and countless other themes.</p>
<p>Much like other quirky family comedies such as <i><a href="/wiki/Malcolm_in_the_Middle.html" title="Malcolm in the Middle">Malcolm in the Middle</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/The_Simpsons.html" title="The Simpsons">The Simpsons</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Roseanne.html" title="Roseanne">Roseanne</a></i>, and <i><a href="/wiki/Married..._with_Children.html" title="Married... with Children">Married... with Children</a></i>, the family unit is depicted as necessary for the survival of the <a href="/wiki/Individual.html" title="Individual">individual</a>.

<h3>Unique presentation</h3>
<p><i>Arrested Development</i> uses several elements that are rare for American live-action sitcoms. Like a <a href="/wiki/Documentary_film.html" title="Documentary film">documentary</a>, it often cuts away abruptly from scenes in order to supplement the narrative with <a href="/wiki/False_document.html" title="False document">false documents</a> like security camera footage, Bluth family photos, website screenshots, and archive films. Flashbacks are also extensively used to show the Bluth family in various stages of their lives. The show does not employ a <a href="/wiki/Laugh_track.html" title="Laugh track">laugh track</a>, allowing for uninterrupted back-and-forth dialogue and permitting more time for plot development and jokes. An omniscient third-person <a href="/wiki/Narrator.html" title="Narrator">narrator</a> (producer <a href="/wiki/Ron_Howard.html" title="Ron Howard">Ron Howard</a>) ties together the multiple plot threads running through each episode, and provides tongue-in-cheek commentary. Wordplay is abundant, for humor and plot; a character may misinterpret an ambiguous phrase with embarrassing or disastrous results. Perhaps most startling for new viewers is the pace, which throws complex, often subtle humor and plot details at the viewer with little breathing room.</p>

<p><a name=".22On_the_next.E2.80.A6.22"></a></p>
<h3>"On the next…"</h3>
<p>Nearly every episode ends with an epilogue segment called "On the next <i>Arrested Development</i>," in which lingering stories are wrapped up or extended humorously. These segments portray events that do not actually appear in the subsequent episodes, but remain part of the series' <a href="/wiki/Canon_%28fiction%29.html" title="Canon (fiction)">canon</a>. However, on some rare occasions (typically in the first half of a two-part episode), scenes from these portions are worked into the following episode; also, the segment occasionally shows a significant plot twist (e.g. Maggie Lizer's deception, Buster's accident, Steve Holt's discovery).</p>
<p>The first two season finales changed the segment to "On the next season of <i>Arrested Development</i>…" and in the third season finale (which was also the series finale), it became "On the epilogue…"</p>

In the episode "<a href="/wiki/For_British_Eyes_Only.html" title="For British Eyes Only">For British Eyes Only</a>," Michael tells George Sr., who he believes is trying to convince him of a lie, "You're a regular Brad Garrett."

<h3>Topicality</h3>
<p><i>Arrested Development</i> plays with divisive, controversial social and political issues. Writers have turned references to the <a href="/wiki/Abu_Ghraib_prison.html" title="Abu Ghraib prison">Abu Ghraib prison</a> scandal, the U.S. Army's recruiting crisis, the non-existence of <a href="/wiki/Weapons_of_mass_destruction.html" title="Weapons of mass destruction">weapons of mass destruction</a> in Iraq, and George W. Bush's "<a href="/wiki/Mission_Accomplished.html" title="Mission Accomplished">Mission Accomplished</a>" <a href="/wiki/Photo-op.html" title="Photo-op">photo-op</a> into jokes. In that same vein, George Sr. has appeared as <a href="/wiki/Osama_Bin_Laden.html" title="Osama Bin Laden">Osama Bin Laden</a> and <a href="/wiki/Saddam_Hussein.html" title="Saddam Hussein">Saddam Hussein</a>. It has also poked fun at the decadence of American <a href="/wiki/White_collar.html" title="White collar">white collar</a> criminals, religious protest campaigns, controversy over public display of the <a href="/wiki/Ten_Commandments.html" title="Ten Commandments">Ten Commandments</a>, and the restriction of protesters to "<a href="/wiki/Free_speech_zones.html" title="Free speech zones">free speech zones</a>". Other references include "Girls with Low Self-Esteem" (a parody of <i><a href="/wiki/Girls_Gone_Wild.html" title="Girls Gone Wild">Girls Gone Wild</a></i>), <a href="/wiki/Low-carb_diet.html" title="Low-carb diet">low-carb diets</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Star_Wars_kid.html" title="Star Wars kid">"Star Wars Kid" Ghyslain Raza</a>.</p>
<p>Even Gob's name (an acronym for his full name George Oscar Bluth II) is a parody of the name <a href="/wiki/Jeb_Bush.html" title="Jeb Bush">Jeb Bush</a> (John Ellis Bush), also a son in a wealthy, powerful family.</p>

<h3>Continuity</h3>
<p>The plot regularly features <a href="/wiki/Callback_%28comedy%29.html" title="Callback (comedy)">callbacks</a> to previous episodes (e.g., GOB's recurring use of the phrase "Come on!," repeated use of family members' "chicken dances," and the interrogative, "Her?") and will often use what creator Mitch Hurwitz has termed "call-forwards," wherein plots or events will be foreshadowed in extremely subtle ways.</p>

<p>Besides the short <a href="/wiki/Ukulele.html" title="Ukulele">ukulele</a>-based theme song composed by David Schwartz, which is also used as <a href="/wiki/Lindsay_Bluth_F%C3%BCnke.html" title="Lindsay Bluth Fünke">Lindsay</a>'s cell phone ringtone, a couple of other songs are featured prominently in <i>Arrested Development</i>. GOB uses <a href="/wiki/Europe_%28band%29.html" title="Europe (band)">Europe</a>'s 1986 <a href="/wiki/Hit_single.html" title="Hit single">hit single</a>, "<a href="/wiki/The_Final_Countdown_%28song%29.html" title="The Final Countdown (song)">The Final Countdown</a>" in his magic acts, attempting to increase the audience's excitement through improvised dancing and rapid-fire magic tricks. The dramatic, synthesized chords, combined with GOB's high energy and overacting are a clear parody of modern magic acts. "The Final Countdown" is also GOB's ringtone. In the second and third seasons of the show GOB's duet with his puppet Franklin, title "It Ain't Easy Being White," has also become a repeated joke. The duet parodies Stevie Wonder and Paul McCartney's "Ebony and Ivory."</p>
<p>"Free at Last," written by David Schwartz and Gabriel Mann, and performed by Mann and Maxayn Lewis, is used in conjunction with parties, protests, or other events involving <a href="/wiki/Gay.html" title="Gay">gay</a> men, <a href="/wiki/Transvestite.html" title="Transvestite">transvestites</a>, or male <a href="/wiki/Stripper.html" title="Stripper">strippers</a>. A recurring gay crossdresser holds a "Freedom" sign of various sizes under this music. An original song called "Big Yellow Joint," apparently written about the Bluth Banana Stand, sounds almost identical to <a href="/wiki/Arlo_Guthrie.html" title="Arlo Guthrie">Arlo Guthrie</a>'s "<a href="/wiki/Alice%27s_Restaurant.html" title="Alice's Restaurant">Alice's Restaurant</a>" and is often used in scenes with aged hippie Oscar Bluth or his stash of <a href="/wiki/Marijuana.html" title="Marijuana">marijuana</a>. "Gonna Get Together," by <a  class="external text" title="http://www.leroyrocks.com">Leroy</a>, is used in many instances to convey a sense of excitement by George Michael about his cousin, Maeby. <a href="/wiki/Nikka_Costa.html" title="Nikka Costa">Nikka Costa</a>'s "Everybody Got Their Something" is also used in the score for energetic segues.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a  title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>Short clips of music are also used to highlight recurring comedic themes in the series. For example, during George Sr.'s stints with religion, or other religious experiences, whether real or feigned, a <a href="/wiki/Duduk.html" title="Duduk">duduk</a> moans in the background. "Christmas Time Is Here," <a href="/wiki/Vince_Guaraldi.html" title="Vince Guaraldi">Vince Guaraldi</a>'s <a href="/wiki/Piano.html" title="Piano">piano</a> theme from <i><a href="/wiki/A_Charlie_Brown_Christmas.html" title="A Charlie Brown Christmas">A Charlie Brown Christmas</a></i>, plays when <a href="/wiki/Characters_from_Arrested_Development#George_Michael_Bluth.html" title="Characters from Arrested Development">George Michael Bluth</a> is depressed. Mentions of Mexico get a <a href="/wiki/Classical_guitar.html" title="Classical guitar">Spanish guitar</a> riff, and displays of <i>Balboa Bay Window</i> magazine are accompanied by upbeat <a href="/wiki/Elevator_music.html" title="Elevator music">elevator music</a>. The same dramatic <a href="/wiki/Soap_opera.html" title="Soap opera">soap opera</a> style music can always be heard (and abruptly cut off) whenever Oscar makes a hint about being Buster's father.</p>

<h3>Ratings</h3>
<p>The show was critically acclaimed but did not gain a sizeable audience. According to the <a href="/wiki/Nielsen_Ratings.html" title="Nielsen Ratings">Nielsen Ratings</a> system, U.S. ratings in the second season averaged about six million viewers, while the third season averaged about four million viewers.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a  title="">[4]</a></sup> To promote their re-broadcast of the animated series <i><a href="/wiki/Family_Guy.html" title="Family Guy">Family Guy</a></i>, FOX announced that it would halt the production of the second season at eighteen episodes–four episodes short of the planned season. Despite rumors that this was a prelude to cancellation, the network defended its actions, claiming that the show would fare poorly during <a href="/wiki/Sweeps.html" title="Sweeps">network sweeps</a> period and that it was simply a procedural matter. For the third season FOX positioned the show directly opposite <i>Monday Night Football</i>. Ratings were even worse than previous seasons. David Cross alluded to poor marketing of the show by FOX on the second season DVD. On <a href="/wiki/November_9.html" title="November 9">November 9</a>, <a href="/wiki/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>, FOX announced that the show would not be airing in November <a href="/wiki/Sweeps.html" title="Sweeps">sweeps</a> and that they had cut the episode order for Season 3 from 22 to 13.

The ratings for the final episodes were poor. FOX has officially cancelled the show.</p>

<dd>"As oddball as <i>Arrested</i> is, it's also humane. A flawless cast — from Will Arnett's breathy, bombastic Gob to Jessica Walter's boozy Lucille — grounds it, aided by Ron Howard's affable narration. Of course, the center of sensibility is good son Michael (Jason Bateman) and his even better son, George Michael (Michael Cera). Bateman and Cera give the best reacts around — the former all weary exasperation, the latter adorably bunny-stunned. Together, they're the sweetest, awkwardest straight men on the smartest, most shockingly funny series on TV...which is likely canceled, despite six Emmy wins. It's a perversion not even the Bluths deserve."

<li>David Cross was originally approached to play Buster, but opted to play Tobias so he wouldn't have to spend as much time in Los Angeles, as the role was originally intended to only be a recurring character. Due to the character's popularity during test-screenings of the pilot episode, he was given a much bigger role, and is the only actor on the show to improvise a large portion of his dialogue.</li>
<li>Contrary to popular belief, almost none of the actors' lines were improvised (except the above-mentioned David Cross), and the show was very tightly scripted, with writers often on set during shoot to punch up dialogue. The actors' movements, however, are mostly improvised.</li>
<li>Contrary to many sitcoms, which shoot in a <a href="/wiki/Multicamera_setup.html" title="Multicamera setup">multicamera setup</a> with four or five cameras behind the <a href="/wiki/Fourth_wall.html" title="Fourth wall">fourth wall</a> on a set, Arrested Development is shot in a <a href="/wiki/Single_camera_setup.html" title="Single camera setup">single camera setup</a> with several free moving camera operators which follow the actors around in the style of a documentary.</li>
<li>As the narrator, Ron Howard makes several references to both <i><a href="/wiki/The_Andy_Griffith_Show.html" title="The Andy Griffith Show">The Andy Griffith Show</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Happy_Days.html" title="Happy Days">Happy Days</a></i> on which he played Opie Taylor and Richie Cunningham, respectively.</li>
<li>Many of <a href="/wiki/David_Cross.html" title="David Cross">David Cross</a>'s co-stars from <i><a href="/wiki/Mr._Show_with_Bob_and_David.html" title="Mr. Show with Bob and David">Mr. Show with Bob and David</a></i> made brief appearances on the show, including <a href="/wiki/Bob_Odenkirk.html" title="Bob Odenkirk">Bob Odenkirk</a> (as "Dr. Gunty"), <a href="/wiki/Jay_Johnston.html" title="Jay Johnston">Jay Johnston</a> (as "Officer Taylor"), <a href="/wiki/Jerry_Minor.html" title="Jerry Minor">Jerry Minor</a> (as "Officer Carter"), <a href="/wiki/John_Ennis_%28actor%29.html" title="John Ennis (actor)">John Ennis</a> (as "Supervisor"), <a href="/wiki/Jack_Black_%28actor%29.html" title="Jack Black (actor)">Jack Black</a> (as "man throwing darts"), and <a  class="new" title="Becky Thyre">Becky Thyre</a> (as "Loretta").</li>
<li>In the episode <i><a href="/wiki/Development_Arrested.html" title="Development Arrested">Development Arrested</a></i>, a <i><a href="/wiki/Skating_With_Celebrities.html" title="Skating With Celebrities">Skating With Celebrities</a></i> promotional poster is seen at the Tantamount Studios campus, and later Buster says he prefers that show when Maeby attempts to get him to sign away the rights of the Bluth family story for a movie. (<i>Celebrities</i> not only took <i>Arrested'</i>s Monday night time slot, but also increased the Monday ratings considerably.)</li>
<li>Scenes involving the Bluth Frozen Banana Stand were filmed next to the lighthouse in <a href="/wiki/Fisherman%27s_Village.html" title="Fisherman's Village">Fisherman's Village</a>, Marina del Rey, California.</li>
<li>On the show, GOB gets married to a stranger after a series of escalating dares. The woman is played by <a href="/wiki/Amy_Poehler.html" title="Amy Poehler">Amy Poehler</a>, who is Will Arnett's wife.</li>
