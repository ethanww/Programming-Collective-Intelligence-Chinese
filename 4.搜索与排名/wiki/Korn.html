<p><a name="Forming_and_their_debut_album" id="Forming_and_their_debut_album"></a></p>
<h3>Forming and their debut album</h3>
<p>Drummer <a href="/wiki/David_Silveria.html" title="David Silveria">David Silveria</a>, guitarist <a href="/wiki/Munky.html" title="Munky">Munky</a> (a.k.a. James Shaffer) and bassist <a href="/wiki/Fieldy.html" title="Fieldy">Fieldy</a> (Reginald Arvizu) were involved with <a  class="new" title="Rick Morrill">Rick Morrill</a> - fronted hair band <a href="/wiki/L.A.P.D._%28band%29.html" title="L.A.P.D. (band)">L.A.P.D.</a> (Love And Peace Dude). It was later changed to stand for Laughing As People Die in order to be taken more seriously as a band. During the mid-80s, Fieldy and Head (Brian Welch) were also members of glam rock outfit Rag Tyme. 'Head' took his nickname (an unwanted one) from the large size of his head, not from any sexual connotation, 'Munky' a reference to primate like feet whilst 'Fieldy' was an abbreviation of 'Garfield', in honour of the bassist's prominent cheeks. Bizarrely, Arvizu had also temped for a Keith Galloway-fronted band named Pretty Boy Floyd, although not the familiar glam outfit of the same name. L.A.P.D. undertook gigs around southern California and contracted a label deal with independent label Triple-X Records, resulting in a 12" single and an album entitled 'Who's Laughing Now', both released in 1992. When L.A.P.D. folded, due to time honoured musical differences, Morrill forged Supermodel with erstwhile Sexart personnel.</p>
<p>During 1993 <a href="/wiki/Jonathan_Davis.html" title="Jonathan Davis">Jonathan Davis</a> got together with <a href="/wiki/Human_Waste_Project.html" title="Human Waste Project">Human Waste Project</a> for their first demo tape dueting with vocalist <a href="/wiki/Aimee_Echo.html" title="Aimee Echo">Aimee Echo</a> on a strictly non-saccharine cover version of 'This Town' by The Go-Go's. This recording was to be unearthed on a subsequent Korn bootleg. (Such was the fascination between fans of both bands that during late 1997 the acts convened once more in the recording studio to lay down a further take on the song interbred for use as a Korn single B side).</p>
<p>Munky, Head, Fieldy and Silveria in the meantime, had assembled Creep. Whilst on the lookout for a singer, Silveria was headhunted for Mike Muir's Infectious Grooves, but opted to remain with his colleagues. Whilst on the hunt for a singer the quartet spotted Davis performing with Sexart at John Bryan's Bar. Auditions in Huntington Beach secured the band's new frontman.</p>
<p>Korn would be the name of the band, chosen because no-one would forget it. Their manager Larry Weintraub thought it was so bad that they would never get a record deal with it. Davis then proposed another name to Weintraub: they would name the band after him, and be called 'Larry'. Weintraub gave in at this point, and got them signed within three months under their original name of Korn, with Jonathan developing the logo with the infantile reversed 'R'. The band released their self-titled debut album, <i><a href="/wiki/Korn_%28album%29.html" title="Korn (album)">Korn</a></i>, through Epic/Immortal Records in October, 1994. <i>Korn</i> is arguably the album most responsible for the rise of <a href="/wiki/Nu_metal.html" title="Nu metal">nu metal</a> and has been a vital influence to legions of other bands of the genre including <a href="/wiki/Limp_Bizkit.html" title="Limp Bizkit">Limp Bizkit</a>, <a href="/wiki/Coal_Chamber.html" title="Coal Chamber">Coal Chamber</a>, <a href="/wiki/Adema.html" title="Adema">Adema</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Slipknot_%28band%29.html" title="Slipknot (band)">Slipknot</a>, earning Korn the frequent nickname 'godfather of nu-metal.'</p>

<p><a name="Life_is_Peachy_and_Elementree_Records" id="Life_is_Peachy_and_Elementree_Records"></a></p>
<h3>Life is Peachy and Elementree Records</h3>
<p>The band followed up their debut album with their second album, <i><a href="/wiki/Life_Is_Peachy.html" title="Life Is Peachy">Life Is Peachy</a></i>, in October, 1996. The album was more successful than their first, debuting at No.3 on The Billboard 200. It spawned a <a href="/wiki/Grammy_Award.html" title="Grammy Award">Grammy</a> nomination for <a href="/wiki/Grammy_Award_for_Best_Metal_Performance.html" title="Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance">Best Metal Performance</a> in the song "No Place to Hide." The album's release featured the first live internet broadcast by the band, and thus Korn became the first music artist to appear live on the internet to promote their new LP. Korn performed songs from the new album and took calls from internet fans watching at home. The event was hosted by longtime Korn friend, <a href="/wiki/Adam_Carolla.html" title="Adam Carolla">Adam Carolla</a>, known best for his hosting of Loveline. The online performance was one of the first of its kind and helped launch Korn's internet presence which soon became a predominant part of their marketing and availability to fans.</p>
<p>In late 1997 the band formed their own label, Elementree Records. The first band they signed was Orgy (featuring former members of Davis' old band Sexart), who became successful with their debut album "Candyass," which was certified platinum. Over the next few years they signed such acts as Videodrone, rapper Marz, and Deadsy.</p>

<h3>Follow the Leader, KornTV, and Family Values</h3>
<p>Prior to the release of the band's 3rd album, Korn was featured once a week on their internet TV show, KornTV, which showed behind the scenes of the making of the record as well as special guests such as <a href="/wiki/Porn_star.html" title="Porn star">porn star</a> <a href="/wiki/Ron_Jeremy.html" title="Ron Jeremy">Ron Jeremy</a>, <a href="/wiki/Limp_Bizkit.html" title="Limp Bizkit">Limp Bizkit</a>, <a href="/wiki/311_%28band%29.html" title="311 (band)">311</a> and many more. It also gave fans the chance to call in and ask the band questions. Korn was already ahead of the game by utilizing the internet to reach their fans. August 1998 saw Korn at their peak as they released their third album, <i><a href="/wiki/Follow_the_Leader_%28Korn%29.html" title="Follow the Leader (Korn)">Follow the Leader</a></i>. It is generally recognized as their breakthrough album, and the album that ultimately ushered nu metal into the mainstream. It featured a number of guest vocalists such as <a href="/wiki/Ice_Cube.html" title="Ice Cube">Ice Cube</a>, <a href="/wiki/Tre_Hardson.html" title="Tre Hardson">Tre Hardson</a> from the <a href="/wiki/Pharcyde.html" title="Pharcyde">Pharcyde</a> and <a href="/wiki/Fred_Durst.html" title="Fred Durst">Fred Durst</a> of <a href="/wiki/Limp_Bizkit.html" title="Limp Bizkit">Limp Bizkit</a>. Korn launched a whirlwind political campaign-style tour (from August 17, 1998 in Los Angeles through September 1 in Phoenix) to promote the release of Follow the Leader. It took the group all over North America to spread the news of their "Family Values" platform to hordes of fans at special "fan conferences" that were organized at every stop along the tour route. Korn chartered a jet, which took them to record stores in such cities as Riverside (CA), San Francisco, Seattle, Minneapolis, Chicago, Detroit, Philadelphia, Boston, New York City, Toronto, Atlanta, and Dallas. They talked to fans at every stop, answered questions during the special "fan conferences" and signed autographs. Jim Rose hosted the entire "Kampaign" tour. Celebrities at various stops included <a href="/wiki/Ice_Cube.html" title="Ice Cube">Ice Cube</a> and <a href="/wiki/Todd_McFarlane.html" title="Todd McFarlane">Todd McFarlane</a>. The album was a success, reaching No.1 on the U.S. and Canadian charts and spawning the singles "Got the Life" and "Freak On A Leash." Follow The Leader debuted at the #1 slot in Canada, New Zealand and Australia; #4 in Finland; #5 in France, the UK and Norway; #8 in Japan; #10 in Holland; #12 in Germany; and it registered the highest debut on the Pan European "Music &amp; Media" chart (at #6). The animated segments in the video for "Freak On A Leash" were directed by <a href="/wiki/Todd_McFarlane.html" title="Todd McFarlane">Todd McFarlane</a> (creator of the <a href="/wiki/Spawn_%28comics%29.html" title="Spawn (comics)">Spawn</a> comic book and a former artist for Spider-Man comics), who also drew the cover for the album. The live action in the video, directed by <a href="/wiki/Jonathan_Dayton_%28director%29.html" title="Jonathan Dayton (director)">Jonathan Dayton</a> and <a href="/wiki/Valerie_Faris.html" title="Valerie Faris">Valerie Faris</a>, used innovative techniques which featured 'the magic bullet' that the camera followed through various scenes as well as a performance of the band in a Twilight Zone like room. "Freak on a Leash" won a <a href="/wiki/Grammy.html" title="Grammy">Grammy</a> for Best Video (Short Form), earned 9 MTV Awards nominations, for: Video of the Year, Breakthrough Video, Best Direction, Best Special Effects, Best Art Direction, Best Cinematography, and Viewer's Choice. Eventually it won 2, for: Best Rock Video, and Best Editing. <i>Follow the Leader</i> is the band's most commercially successful album, being certified 5x <a href="/wiki/Gold_record.html" title="Gold record">Platinum</a> by the <a href="/wiki/RIAA.html" title="RIAA">RIAA</a> and having sold almost 10 million copies worldwide.</p>
<p>The same year <i>Follow the Leader</i> was released, Korn started their own annual <a href="/wiki/Heavy_metal_music.html" title="Heavy metal music">heavy metal</a> tour called the <a href="/wiki/Family_Values_Tour.html" title="Family Values Tour">Family Values Tour</a>. That year they headlined the tour along with <a href="/wiki/Incubus_%28band%29.html" title="Incubus (band)">Incubus</a>, <a href="/wiki/Orgy_%28band%29.html" title="Orgy (band)">Orgy</a>, Limp Bizkit, Ice Cube and <a href="/wiki/Rammstein.html" title="Rammstein">Rammstein</a>. It was highly successful tour, there was a live CD and DVD from Family Values Tour'98 which earned gold and platinum status, respectively. In 1999, Limp Bizkit headlined, along with <a href="/wiki/Primus_%28band%29.html" title="Primus (band)">Primus</a>, <a href="/wiki/Staind.html" title="Staind">Staind</a>, Korn, <a href="/wiki/The_Crystal_Method.html" title="The Crystal Method">The Crystal Method</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Filter_%28band%29.html" title="Filter (band)">Filter</a>. Korn were not featured on the bill and instead only made surprise appearances at a few of the tour's stops to perform their first single off of their next album, "<a href="/wiki/Falling_Away_From_Me.html" title="Falling Away From Me">Falling Away From Me</a>." The tour took a break in 2000 due to heavy competition.</p>
<p>In 1999 Korn performed at <a href="/wiki/Woodstock_%2799.html" title="Woodstock '99">Woodstock '99</a> on 23rd of July in front of 250,000 fans. The band cites its performance as one of its most memorable moments.</p>

<h3>Issues and The Apollo</h3>
<p>The band's next album, <i><a href="/wiki/Issues_%28album%29.html" title="Issues (album)">Issues</a></i>, was released in November 1999. The album debuted at #1 on The Billboard 200 and was certified 3x <a href="/wiki/Gold_record.html" title="Gold record">Platinum</a> by the <a href="/wiki/RIAA.html" title="RIAA">RIAA</a>, following up the success of <i>Follow the Leader</i>. It featured a broader range of styles and vocals compared to previous albums. To celebrate the album's release, the band performed the record in its entirety in front of a live audience at <a href="/wiki/New_York.html" title="New York">New York</a>'s historic <a href="/wiki/Apollo_Theater.html" title="Apollo Theater">Apollo Theater</a> and broadcast the concert simultaneously across many radio stations. This performance made Korn only the second white musical group to ever perform at The Apollo after the legendary Buddy Holly in the late 1950's. This special event featured the NYPD marching drum and bagpipe band as well as a group of back-up singers to enhance the more melodic choruses and backing vocals Jonathan Davis used on the album. Earlier that year, Korn had appeared on an episode of <a href="/wiki/South_Park.html" title="South Park">South Park</a>, titled <a href="/wiki/List_of_South_Park_episodes#Season_3_.281999-2000.29.html" title="List of South Park episodes">Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery</a>, in which the first single from Issues, "Falling Away From Me" was premiered. In the episode, the band helped the boys solve a <a href="/wiki/Scooby-Doo.html" title="Scooby-Doo">Scooby-Doo</a> style mystery. Korn released two more singles off of Issues, "Make Me Bad" and "Somebody Someone", both of which fared well on US charts. Videos were also shot for all three singles, with longtime friend <a href="/wiki/Fred_Durst.html" title="Fred Durst">Fred Durst</a> directing the dark "<a href="/wiki/Falling_Away_from_Me.html" title="Falling Away from Me">Falling Away from Me</a>", and <a href="/wiki/Udo_Kier.html" title="Udo Kier">Udo Kier</a> and <a href="/wiki/Brigitte_Nielsen.html" title="Brigitte Nielsen">Brigitte Nielsen</a> starring in a concept video for "Make Me Bad." The video for "Somebody Someone" was a simple performance with some <a href="/wiki/CGI.html" title="CGI">CGI</a> effects.</p>
<p>In 2000 Jonathan Davis commissioned famous Swiss, surreal artist - <a href="/wiki/H.R._Giger.html" title="H.R. Giger">H.R. Giger</a> to create a special mic stand. The idea was suggested to him by one of his friends who knew that Jonathan was a fan of his artwork. H.R. Giger is an artist for whom music is really important, and he must like it, before he will work with the band. He listened to the Korn CDs the band sent him, and on the same day agreed to do the project. He started doing some sketches of plantlike snakes and vertebrae mixed with technical elements. In the meanwhile Giger's agent went to the U.S. to tape some Korn shows, in order to analyze the way Jonathan performs. Jonathan called him from his dressing room and told him that he had complete freedom to design the microphone stand as he wanted and his only concern was that it had be totally functional and as movable as possible.

<h3>Untouchables and Tomb Raider</h3>
<p>In June 2002, after two and a half years of hard work and a long creative process, Korn re-emerged into the media spotlight with their 5th album, <i><a href="/wiki/Untouchables_%28album%29.html" title="Untouchables (album)">Untouchables</a></i>. The release of this album was preceded by the show at Hammerstein Ballroom in New York on 10th June 2002, one day prior to the album's release, broadcasted digitally through the theaters in U.S. As befits the trend-setting rock pioneers, Korn recorded Untouchables in a way that no rock artist has done before. By utilizing the new Euphonix R1 Digital Hard Disk Recorder with a 96k, 24-bit sampling rate - which is twice the highest rate that’s normally used for recording - Korn and producer Michael Beinhorn were able to create a rich sonic panorama which accentuates clarity as well as harmonics that are perceived rather than heard as musical sounds. The album had a very <a href="/wiki/Dark.html" title="Dark">dark</a> and <a href="/wiki/Gothic_rock.html" title="Gothic rock">gothic</a> feel while featuring synths, strings and various effects the band had never used in an album before. The overall feel was drastically different from previous efforts particularly tracks like "Alone I Break," "Hating," and the haunting "Hollow Life," which singer Jonathan Davis claims is his favorite Korn song to this day. While the album received critical praise from fans, <i>Untouchables</i> had disappointing sales. The band has blamed <a href="/wiki/Warez.html" title="Warez">Internet piracy</a> for the drop in sales - as an unmixed version of the album had leaked a whole five months prior to its official release date (from Munky's computer).</p>
<p>The album's first single "Here to Stay" earned a <a href="/wiki/Grammy.html" title="Grammy">Grammy</a> for Best Metal Performance. <i>Untouchables</i> has since been certified <a href="/wiki/Music_recording_sales_certification.html" title="Music recording sales certification">Platinum</a> by the <a href="/wiki/RIAA.html" title="RIAA">RIAA</a>. The first 2 videos from Untouchables were directed by the Hughes Brothers (best known for their films, <a href="/wiki/Menace_II_Society.html" title="Menace II Society">Menace II Society</a> and <a href="/wiki/From_Hell.html" title="From Hell">From Hell</a>). The first video, "Here To Stay," has the band playing inside a TV on a static background along with controversial news stories and world issues being presented. The video was nominated to Mtv Video Music Award for Best Rock Video and won MuchMusic Video Award for Best International Video (Group). The second video, "Thoughtless," was a nod back to Jonathan's childhood as the character in the video is picked on and constantly beaten. The character ultimately gains revenge in a rather grotesque but deserving way. The third video for Untouchables, "Alone I Break," was directed by Sean Dack who won the honor of directing Korn's video through an MTV contest. The video kept with the darkness of Korn, showing Jonathan Davis killing off the members of the band after a supposed mistake made by Munky when they were performing. The band later admitted the video would have been more fun to do if the director was actually a Korn fan.</p>
<p>Prior to their next album, Korn released the single "Did My Time," which was featured on the soundtrack to the Angelina Jolie film, <a  title="Tomb Raider: Cradle of Life">Tomb Raider: Cradle of Life</a> in early 2003. Angelina Jolie appeared in the video for "Did My Time," however due to scheduling conflicts the band's performance was shot at a different time and location than Angelina Jolie's. The single Did My Time was also used on the next album.</p>

<h3>Take a Look in the Mirror, Greatest Hits, Head's Departure</h3>
<p>Korn's sixth album, <i><a href="/wiki/Take_a_Look_in_the_Mirror.html" title="Take a Look in the Mirror">Take a Look in the Mirror</a></i> was released in November 2003. Korn produced this record themselves and cited it as a look back upon their career by returning back to a more stripped down and raw sound. The album featured the singles "<a href="/wiki/Right_Now.html" title="Right Now">Right Now</a>," "<a href="/wiki/Everything_I%27ve_Known.html" title="Everything I've Known">Everything I've Known</a>," and "<a href="/wiki/Y%27All_Want_a_Single.html" title="Y'All Want a Single">Y'All Want a Single</a>." The first two singles were animated videos while the third single, "<a href="/wiki/Y%27All_Want_a_Single.html" title="Y'All Want a Single">Y'All Want a Single</a>," was a performance video, which featured Korn and a large group of fans destroying a record store. The album peaked at No. 9 on The Billboard 200. Although the album provided what the fans were supposedly looking for, it was considered a disappointment by many who thought the first album could never be duplicated. The album also features the remastered track "Alive," which is the song Davis sang back in 1993 while first trying out for the band.</p>
<p>In 2004, Korn released their <a href="/wiki/Greatest_hits.html" title="Greatest hits">greatest hits</a> album, <i><a href="/wiki/Greatest_Hits%2C_Volume_1.html" title="Greatest Hits, Volume 1">Greatest Hits, Volume 1</a></i>. It featured two cover songs and a compilation of the band's hits from the past 10 years. The first single was a cover of the song "Word Up!", which was originally made popular by the group <a href="/wiki/Cameo_%28band%29.html" title="Cameo (band)">Cameo</a>. Many fans have wondered why the compilation did not feature the hit single "Thoughtless". The album also featured a medley of all three parts of Pink Floyd's "<a href="/wiki/Another_Brick_in_the_Wall.html" title="Another Brick in the Wall">Another Brick in the Wall</a>." Another as yet unreleased cover "Love My Way" found its way to the internet, after it was ripped from an Arizona radio station by a korn fan known as 'DeЯeK'. This song was very well received among the korn fans, with many hailing it to be their best cover yet.</p>

<p>The band's first release for Virgin Records, "<a href="/wiki/See_You_On_The_Other_Side.html" title="See You On The Other Side">See You On The Other Side</a>" was released on December 6th 2005, and debuted on #3 on the Billboard 200, representing the band's 7th Top 10 debut. The first single off the album, <i>"Twisted Transistor"</i> was accompanied by a comic video directed by <a href="/wiki/Dave_Meyers.html" title="Dave Meyers">Dave Meyers</a> in which famous rap stars <a href="/wiki/Xzibit.html" title="Xzibit">Xzibit</a>, <a href="/wiki/Lil%27_Jon.html" title="Lil' Jon">Lil' Jon</a>, <a href="/wiki/Snoop_Dogg.html" title="Snoop Dogg">Snoop Dogg</a>, and <a href="/wiki/David_Banner.html" title="David Banner">David Banner</a> portrayed Korn. It has received massive video play in TV music stations throughout whole world. The single itself peaked on #3 on Billboard Mainstream Rock chart, and it's among 2006’s Top 5 Active Rock songs so far in 2006. The second (and current) single, <i>"<a href="/wiki/Coming_Undone.html" title="Coming Undone">Coming Undone</a>"</i> peaked on #4 on Mainstream Rock Chart, and the video directed by <a href="/wiki/Little_X.html" title="Little X">Little X</a> also received considerable video play. Korn also, for the first time has brought two singles from one album to <a href="/wiki/Hot_100.html" title="Hot 100">Hot 100</a> Chart. The album has sold over 2 million copies worldwide up to date, and went platinum in the U.S. on 16th March. The album managed to stay in Top 100 of Billboard 200 chart for 35 straight weeks, and it's very likely that it will be certified double-platinum later this year, signalling the success and acceptance of their evolution, as well as a sales lift from 1.1 million copies sold of <a href="/wiki/Take_a_Look_in_the_Mirror.html" title="Take a Look in the Mirror">Take a Look in the Mirror</a>.</p>

<h3>Recent History and Jonathan Davis</h3>
<p>On June 12th, 2006, Jonathan Davis was diagnosed with <a href="/wiki/Idiopathic_thrombocytopenic_purpura.html" title="Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura">Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura</a>, a blood defect that hospitalized him for the weekend and prevented him performing at the renowned <a href="/wiki/Download_Festival.html" title="Download Festival">Download Festival</a> England &amp; Ireland and has led to Korn cancelling the rest of their European bill. It was originally unknown to the public what his ailment was, but the singer revealed in a letter to fans that he was 'dangerously low on blood platelets and at a high risk of death from a hemorrhage if the problem was not treated.'<sup id="_ref-korn-locker.com_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[4]</a></sup> His illness is not expected to affect the upcoming <a href="/wiki/Family_Values_Tour.html" title="Family Values Tour">Family Values Tour</a>. Recently it has been rumoured that a new album, <a href="/wiki/Korn_Kovers.html" title="Korn Kovers">Korn Kovers</a> is to be released by the band.</p>
<p>On July 13th Jonathan Davis announced that "<a  class="new" title="Politics (KoRn Single)">Politics</a>" would be the third single off "<a href="/wiki/See_You_on_the_Other_Side.html" title="See You on the Other Side">See You on the Other Side</a>" and promised music video. On stage during the Family Vaules Tour in East Troy, Wisconsin, Jon Davis said they were going to shoot the live video and said they would have to play the song twice. What's more, James Shaffer told <a href="/wiki/CJAD.html" title="CJAD">CJAD.com</a> that he and Davis are writing the score for an animated short film that tackles national politics which actually will be separate project, and not music video for band's latest single.</p>
<p>On July 18th band appeared in <a href="/wiki/Jimmy_Kimmel_Live.html" title="Jimmy Kimmel Live">Jimmy Kimmel Live</a> performing in television acoustic versions of their latest two singles, <a href="/wiki/Coming_Undone.html" title="Coming Undone">Coming Undone</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Twisted_Transistor.html" title="Twisted Transistor">Twisted Transistor</a>. That was band's first televised acoustic set.</p>
<p>On July 30, 2006, a violent fight allegedly broke out in the mosh pit at the Family Values Tour in Atlanta, GA while Deftones were performing, resulting in the death of Andy Richardson, age 30, on August 1, 2006. Lawyers representing Mr. RIchardson's family said they may pursue civil actions against Korn and the show's promoters. Mr. Richardson's mother, Gloria Richardson, said "It's not right that someone could go to a concert for a good time and wind up dead ... There needs to be more security or they need to not have these concerts at all ...", in a statement to Cox News Service made on August 1, 2006. One week later, a 24-year-old Douglas County man was charged with delivering a deadly punch in a dispute over a ballcap at a Korn concert. Atlanta police and Douglas County authorities arrested Michael Scott Axley Monday afternoon on a murder warrant in the death of 30-year-old Andy Richardson. Atlanta PD spokesperson Marion Lee said Axley was taken in without incident after officials received tips from witnesses who saw the altercation and knew Axley.</p>
<p>On August 28th, in an interview with Launch Radio Network, Korn announced that they would re-realease their seventh studio album, "<a href="/wiki/See_You_on_the_Other_Side.html" title="See You on the Other Side">See You on the Other Side</a>", on September 26th in expanded form. Originaly believed to be a stand-alone "fan pack" (with no album included), it will be re-realeased with live tracks, bonus DVD footage, and a remix EP named "Chopped and Screwed". Lead singer Jonathan Davis told Launch he's even more enthusiastic about the album now after playing the songs live for the past eight months. Davis says, "I love that record. I think it's one of the best records we've ever done. I love it for the fact that it was experimental. It reminds me of 'Untouchables', which I think is another one of our best records. And adding the background band has just opened up so many new doors for us. You know, there's just so many different possibilities, and going out on the road and being able to play it live is just gonna inspire us to do bigger and better things."</p>

<h3>Eighth Studio Album</h3>
<p>On 7th August, in an exclusive interview with The Gauntlet, KoRn frontman, Jonathan Davis, stated the band has begun writing material for the follow-up to last years hit "<a href="/wiki/See_You_on_the_Other_Side.html" title="See You on the Other Side">See You on the Other Side</a>":</p>

<p>In an another interview with The Rock Radio, Jonathan Davis discussed the writing process and producers of the next 8th studio album.</p>
<p><i>"[...]Yeah, we're working on it right now. We don't know when we'll put it out.....I mean, we're gonna write. It's when we have down time we go and write. But it's exciting and we like writing and keeping that going.</i>" Davis said Korn will probably work with See You On The Other Side collaborators The Matrix and some different producers on the next album.
