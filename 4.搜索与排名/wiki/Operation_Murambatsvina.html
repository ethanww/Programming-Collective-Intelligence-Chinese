Siya-so Home Industries area in Mbare township after Operation Murambatsvina</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Zimbabweans refer to the operation as "Zimbabwe's <a href="/wiki/Tsunami.html" title="Tsunami">Tsunami</a>", in reference to the devastation which followed the tsunami caused by the <a href="/wiki/2004_Indian_Ocean_earthquake.html" title="2004 Indian Ocean earthquake">2004 Indian Ocean earthquake</a>. The crackdown has affected most of the major cities in the country, and the Zimbabwean government has stated its intention to widen the operation to include rural farming areas. Estimates of the number of people affected vary considerably. The latest <a href="/wiki/United_Nations.html" title="United Nations">United Nations</a> figures estimate that it has led to the unemployment of 700,000 people and affected a further 2.4 million people countrywide <sup id="_ref-slams_1" class="reference"><a  title="">[1]</a></sup>. Earlier, the <b>Zimbabwe Human Rights NGO Forum</b> estimated that 64,677 families had been displaced, representing a total of approximately 323,385 people <sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a  title="">[3]</a></sup> (this estimate was based on figures from 45 locations). However, according to the government only 120,000 people have been affected. <sup title="The text in the vicinity of this tag needs citation." class="noprint">[<a  title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><i>citation&#160;needed</i></a>]</sup></p>
<p>Whichever figures are correct, it is clear that large numbers of people have been affected, all of whom are in need of emergency relief and resettlement following the loss of their homes and livelihood. The clearances have been condemned both internally and internationally. A report <sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a  title="">[4]</a></sup> (1.7 Mb pdf) written by Anna Tibaijuka, the Executive Director of the UN Human Settlements Programme, was handed to the Zimbabwean government on <a href="/wiki/July_21.html" title="July 21">July 21</a>, <a href="/wiki/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>. Excerpts from the report, which calls for all demolitions to be stopped immediately, <sup id="_ref-slams_2" class="reference"><a  title="">[1]</a></sup> were made public the following day and describe the operation as a "disastrous venture" which has violated <a href="/wiki/International_law.html" title="International law">international law</a> and led to a serious <a href="/wiki/Humanitarian_crisis.html" title="Humanitarian crisis">humanitarian crisis</a>. The actions of the government are described as indiscriminate, unjustified and conducted without regard for human suffering.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Background">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Background" id="Background"></a></p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Overall responsibility for the clearances rests with the ruling party, <a href="/wiki/ZANU-PF.html" title="ZANU-PF">ZANU-PF</a>. The previous Chairperson of the <a  class="new" title="Harare Commission">Harare Commission</a>, Dr. Jameson Kurasha, initiated Operation Murambatsvina weeks after the disputed <a href="/wiki/Zimbabwe_parliamentary_elections%2C_2005.html" title="Zimbabwe parliamentary elections, 2005">elections</a> were held there. The Harare Commission is currently running the affairs of the City of <a href="/wiki/Harare.html" title="Harare">Harare</a> despite the fact that there is a pending application to the High Court questioning its authority to do so. The Commission itself was appointed by <a  class="new" title="Ignatious Chombo">Ignatious Chombo</a>, the Minister of Local Government, Public Works and Urban Development, leading one Zimbabwean newspaper to comment that "President Mugabe, through the Minister of Local Government, Public Works and National Housing, Ignatious Chombo, is now effectively in control of the City of Harare" <sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a  title="">[5]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Mugabe claims that the clearances are needed in order to carry out "a vigorous clean-up campaign to restore sanity" and he has described the programme as an "urban renewal campaign". Ignatious Chombo has described the operation in terms of 'restoring order': "It is these people who have been making the country ungovernable by their criminal activities actually" <sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a  title="">[6]</a></sup>. The <a  class="new" title="Zimbabwean Police Commissioner">Zimbabwean Police Commissioner</a>, <a  class="new" title="Augustine Chihuri">Augustine Chihuri</a>, said that Operation Murambatsvina was meant to "clean the country of the crawling mass of maggots bent on destroying the economy <sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a  title="">[7]</a></sup>."</p>
<p>While police have carried out most of the demolitions, they have been supported by the army and the <a href="/wiki/Green_bombers.html" title="Green bombers">green bombers</a>. Many inhabitants have been forced to destroy their own homes, sometimes at gunpoint <sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a  title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>People whose homes have been demolished are being told to return to the rural areas or face further action from the <a href="/wiki/Zimbabwe_Republic_Police.html" title="Zimbabwe Republic Police">Zimbabwe Republic Police</a> and the dreaded <a href="/wiki/Central_Intelligence_Organization.html" title="Central Intelligence Organization">Central Intelligence Organization</a>. Education Minister <a href="/wiki/Aeneas_Chigwedere.html" title="Aeneas Chigwedere">Aeneas Chigwedere</a> claimed that there is "nobody in Zimbabwe who does not have a rural home" <sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a  title="">[9]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>It has been subsequently pointed out that many of the people affected originate from neighbouring countries and therefore do not automatically have a rural base in Zimbabwe. For those that do, the fuel crisis in the country makes travelling long distances either impossible, or prohibitively expensive. Instead, those who have friends or family whose homes have not been destroyed have tried to shelter with them, creating massive overcrowding. Others have resorted to sheltering in church yards, many are sleeping rough by the road side, and some have dared to return to sleep in the open beside their destroyed homes.</p>
<p>The clearances have not been restricted only to homes. Demolished buildings include a <a href="/wiki/Roman_Catholic.html" title="Roman Catholic">Roman Catholic</a> <a href="/wiki/Orphanage.html" title="Orphanage">orphanage</a> which had been run by a group of <a href="/wiki/Nun.html" title="Nun">nuns</a>, office blocks, a <a href="/wiki/Sunni.html" title="Sunni">Sunni</a> <a href="/wiki/Mosque.html" title="Mosque">mosque</a>, a <a href="/wiki/World_Bank.html" title="World Bank">World Bank</a>-funded public lavatory and schools.</p>

<p><a name="Alternative_reasons_for_the_clearances" id="Alternative_reasons_for_the_clearances"></a></p>
<h2>Alternative reasons for the clearances</h2>
<p>The Zimbabwean government has argued that Operation Murambatsvina is about restoring order (see Background section). However, the timing of the clearances, so soon after the disputed parliamentary elections on March 31, 2005, combined with the contradictory nature of the operation, has prompted commentators to state that there are alternative reasons for the demolitions, although most say a combination of many of these.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Political retribution">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Political_retribution" id="Political_retribution"></a></p>
<h3>Political retribution</h3>
<p>The opposition <a href="/wiki/Movement_for_Democratic_Change.html" title="Movement for Democratic Change">Movement for Democratic Change</a> (MDC) has argued that the government's main reason for Murambatsvina is to punish the urban poor for voting for the opposition during the March parliamentary elections. The cities are traditionally MDC <a  class="new" title="Strongholds">strongholds</a>, and, in fact, the Harare Commission that initiated the campaign was set up to override the governing powers of the elected MDC <a href="/wiki/City_Council.html" title="City Council">City Council</a>. However, the <a href="/wiki/Retributive_justice.html" title="Retributive justice">retribution</a> rationale is slightly undermined by the fact that some <a href="/wiki/Zanu-PF.html" title="Zanu-PF">Zanu-PF</a> supporters have also been caught up in the <a href="/wiki/Squatter_camp.html" title="Squatter camp">squatter camp</a> clearances.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Weaken the political opposition">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Weaken_the_political_opposition" id="Weaken_the_political_opposition"></a></p>
<h3>Weaken the political opposition</h3>
<p>Some commentators have noted the alarming similarity between the name of this operation and the <a href="/wiki/Gukurahundi.html" title="Gukurahundi">Gukurahundi</a> campaign conducted against the <a href="/wiki/Matabele.html" title="Matabele">Matabele</a> civilians in the early 1980s. The Gukurahundi campaign ultimately resulted in the demise of <a href="/wiki/Joshua_Nkomo.html" title="Joshua Nkomo">Joshua Nkomo</a>'s <a href="/wiki/Zimbabwe_African_People%27s_Union.html" title="Zimbabwe African People's Union">Zimbabwe African People's Union</a> (<a href="/wiki/ZAPU.html" title="ZAPU">ZAPU</a>) when it merged with Robert Mugabe's party in <a href="/wiki/1987.html" title="1987">1987</a>. There has been speculation that the government is aiming to create a situation where the MDC has no choice but to merge with the ruling party.</p>
<p>Commentators also argue that by forcing urban voters out into the rural areas the cities will be de-populated of MDC supporters thus enabling the government to re-populate the <a href="/wiki/Shanty_town.html" title="Shanty town">shanty town</a> areas with Zanu-PF supporters. Further, MDC supporters will be forced to return to live in areas traditionally viewed as Zanu-PF strongholds.</p>
<p>Science and Technology Deputy Minister <a  class="new" title="Patrick Zhuwawo">Patrick Zhuwawo</a> used state media to say that the government had demarcated nearly 10,000 <a href="/wiki/Residential.html" title="Residential">residential</a> stands at Whitecliff Farm for allocation to what he called "deserving people" <sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a  title="">[10]</a></sup>. The <sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a  title="">[11]</a></sup> has interpreted this to mean <i>Zanu-PF supporters</i> and supports the view by identifying the presence of "Zanu-PF sharks" at the centre where people were meant to sign up for new stands. A different source reported that, in <a href="/wiki/Bulawayo.html" title="Bulawayo">Bulawayo</a>, a Zanu-PF representative was tasked with compiling a list of future stand beneficiaries and that the resulting list was dominated by the names of known Zanu-PF supporters. One opposition supporter, whose name was not on the list, alleges that he was bluntly told that he supported the wrong party <sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a  title="">[12]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>It has also been speculated that the campaign, under the guise of destroying '<a href="/wiki/Illegal.html" title="Illegal">illegal</a>' structures, is designed to whip up urban supporter anger towards the City Council that they elected. Many demolished structures were built with City Council permission, and some victims claim that they have paid <a href="/wiki/Rates.html" title="Rates">rates</a> and <a href="/wiki/Taxes.html" title="Taxes">taxes</a>, meaning that their homes should therefore be <a href="/wiki/Legal.html" title="Legal">legal</a> in the eyes of the council. Commentators have suggested that the injustice of demolishing a structure seen by the owner as legal could be designed to whip up anger against the MDC elected City Council, thus compromising the MDC's support base in the urban areas. In fact, as stated in the previous section, the operation was initiated outside the auspices of the City Council by the Harare Commission.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Controlling political protest">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Controlling_political_protest" id="Controlling_political_protest"></a></p>
<h3>Controlling political protest</h3>
<p>There were many reports in the immediate aftermath of the <a href="/wiki/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a> parliamentary elections, widely viewed by the west as neither free nor fair, of potential <a  class="new" title="Mass uprisings">mass uprisings</a> against the government. In fact, <a href="/wiki/Catholic.html" title="Catholic">Catholic</a> <a href="/wiki/Archbishop.html" title="Archbishop">Archbishop</a> <a href="/wiki/Pius_Ncube.html" title="Pius Ncube">Pius Ncube</a>, a respected <a href="/wiki/Human_rights.html" title="Human rights">human rights</a> <a href="/wiki/Activist.html" title="Activist">activist</a> and outspoken <a href="/wiki/Critic.html" title="Critic">critic</a> of the government, publicly called for a peaceful uprising before the elections took place, claiming that the elections had already been fixed <sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a  title="">[13]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>It has been argued that, by dispersing MDC supporters to remote rural locations, the Zanu-PF government would find it easier to control an angry population in the event of possible <a href="/wiki/Riots.html" title="Riots">riots</a> or mass <a href="/wiki/Protests.html" title="Protests">protests</a>. <a  class="new" title="David Coltart">David Coltart</a>, the MDC's legal affairs spokesperson, described the operation as a ýsinister <a href="/wiki/Pre-emptive.html" title="Pre-emptive">pre-emptive</a> strike designed to remove the maximum possible number of people from urban areas to rural areas where they are easier to control"<sup id="_ref-polpot_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[14]</a></sup></p>
<p>Other sources suggest <sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a  title="">[15]</a></sup> that <a href="/wiki/Mengistu_Haile_Mariam.html" title="Mengistu Haile Mariam">Mengistu Haile Mariam</a>, who fled to Harare in 1991 and now acts as President Robert Mugabe's security adviser, warned the Zimbabwean leader that the swelling slum and backyard population in Zimbabwe was creating a fertile ground for a mass uprising.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Risk management as part of future government reform">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Risk_management_as_part_of_future_government_reform" id="Risk_management_as_part_of_future_government_reform"></a></p>
<h3>Risk management as part of future government reform</h3>
<p>The <a  class="new" title="Zimbabwe Human Rights NGO Forum">Zimbabwe Human Rights NGO Forum</a> has advanced another reason for pre-emptively dispersing citizens living in opposition party strongholds. They point to the fact that the government faces an unprecedented economic crisis characterised by fuel and food shortages, rampant <a href="/wiki/Hyperinflation.html" title="Hyperinflation">hyperinflation</a>, and virtually no foreign currency. In order to resolve the crisis, they argue that the Zanu-PF government will be forced, against its will, to re-engage with the international community:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This means a reversal of its whole style of governing, adherence to the rule of law, an end to political violence and repression, opening of the press and media space, and a cessation of all interference with citizensý basic freedoms.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The suggestion therefore is that if <a href="/wiki/Totalitarian.html" title="Totalitarian">totalitarian</a> controls were relaxed - to satisfy international principles and standards - the government would suddenly be exposed to protest and <a href="/wiki/Civic.html" title="Civic">civic</a> pressure. In other words, Operation Murambatsvina may be less to do with fear of protests immediately following the elections (which could be controlled using current methods which rely on a politicised police and army), and more to do with controlling the population <i>after</i> heavy-handed measures were dispensed with:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is predicated on the observation that the greatest risk to repressive governments comes when they seek to <a href="/wiki/Liberalise.html" title="Liberalise">liberalise</a> <sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a  title="">[16]</a></sup>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Zimbabwean 2005 election experiences give some credence to this view. Anticipating electoral <a  class="new" title="Observers">observers</a> coming to the country, the government eased up on a few of its repressive tactics in the months immediately preceding the parliamentary elections. The immediate effect was that MDC supporters felt confident and suddenly openly showed their support for their party in a way they hadn't been able to before. <sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a  title="">[17]</a></sup>.</p>

<h3>Regain control of foreign currency dealings</h3>
<p>Zimbabwe has been fighting to keep control of the <a href="/wiki/Foreign_currency.html" title="Foreign currency">foreign currency</a> market for the last few years by adopting a range of measures, usually spearheaded by Reserve Bank Governor <a href="/wiki/Gideon_Gono.html" title="Gideon Gono">Gideon Gono</a> <sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a  title="">[18]</a></sup>. <a href="/wiki/Sokwanele.html" title="Sokwanele">Sokwanele</a>, a Zimbabwean civic action support group, describes Gideon Gono as having played a major role in Operation Murambatsvina<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a  title="">[19]</a></sup>. In fact, Gideon Gono's appointment to Governor coincided with the beginning of a crackdown on illegal foreign currency dealings prompting one popular source of independent news to report that "one of his key areas of focus is the illegal foreign currency market" <sup id="_ref-forex_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[20]</a></sup>.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Sokwanele.html" title="Sokwanele">Sokwanele</a>, in a different article, explains that the foreign currency market in Zimbabwe is broadly characterised by the <a  class="new" title="Formal market">formal market</a>, the <a  class="new" title="Parallel market">parallel market</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Black_market.html" title="Black market">black market</a> <sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a  title="">[21]</a></sup>. They describe the black market as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Black market transactions happen on the streets, in the flea markets, and in back-rooms; sometimes for small sums of money like 20 US Dollars; and the deals often take place between individuals.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Commentators believe the government is specifically targeting the small scale black market traders through Operation Murambatsvina. <sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a  title="">[22]</a></sup> reports on how informal <a href="/wiki/Vendors.html" title="Vendors">vendors</a> at one market - a market dubbed 'The World Bank' - maintain a facade of trading goods when their real business is dealing in hard cash, albeit very small amounts at a time (<a href="/wiki/April_30.html" title="April 30">April 30</a>, <a href="/wiki/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>). (In fact, Bulawayo's 'The World Bank' was one of the markets targeted when Gono first become Governor of the Reserve Bank in [2003])<sup id="_ref-forex_1" class="reference"><a  title="">[20]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Few analysts believe that the small amounts seized from vendors in one operation could begin to meet the country's massive foreign currency shortfall. This has led to some describing the government's action as indicative of their extreme desperation.</p>
<p>But others have further suggested that the government may believe that customers, unable to trade their money on the black market, will be forced to bring it into the formal <a  class="new" title="Banking sector">banking sector</a>. In addition to that, customers who previously accessed products on the black market will be forced to return to buy them from the <a  class="new" title="Formal sector">formal sector</a>, which the government may believe will help to bring about an economic revival.</p>
<p>Analysts also point out that the government publicly holds market traders responsible for runaway <a href="/wiki/Inflation.html" title="Inflation">inflation</a> so the action could also partly be about retribution against them.</p>

<h3>Supporting the 'Look East' Policy</h3>
<p>Zanu-PF's drive towards resolving its economic crisis has included strengthening its historical ties with <a href="/wiki/China.html" title="China">China</a> <sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a  title="">[23]</a></sup>. The state-controlled newspaper, The Herald, reported on <a href="/wiki/Robert_Mugabe.html" title="Robert Mugabe">Robert Mugabe</a>'s support for Operation Murambastvina, and on his view that the economy was beginning to receive serious and significant investments from the <a href="/wiki/Far_East.html" title="Far East">Far East</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We should not look back, for, looking back, means back to our political enemies and detractors. Industry must recognise this new direction (Look East policy)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This has led some to speculate that the destruction of the <a href="/wiki/Shanty_towns.html" title="Shanty towns">shanty towns</a> are partly in support of <a href="/wiki/China.html" title="China">Chinese</a> business interests in Zimbabwe. A report co-authored by <a href="/wiki/Catholic.html" title="Catholic">Catholic</a> <a href="/wiki/Archbishop.html" title="Archbishop">Archbishop</a> <a href="/wiki/Pius_Ncube.html" title="Pius Ncube">Pius Ncube</a> stated that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Speculation over the motives behind Operation Murambatsvina has pointed to the removal of local competition threatening newly arrived Chinese businessmen whose stores sell cheap and often poor quality goods. It is estimated that, as a result of the government's aggressive 'Look East' policy, up to 10,000 Chinese citizens have moved into the country, and some have moved onto farms taken from highly skilled <a  class="new" title="Commercial farmers">commercial farmers</a>, notably to grow <a href="/wiki/Tobacco.html" title="Tobacco">tobacco</a> for China's 300 million smokers. <sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a  title="">[24]</a></sup>; <sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a  title="">[25]</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As well as practical support of Chinese business interests, many have suggested that Operation Murambatsvina also demonstrates an adherence to a 'Look East' <a href="/wiki/Ideology.html" title="Ideology">ideology</a> and is evidence that Zanu-PF has embraced an <a href="/wiki/Asian.html" title="Asian">Asian</a> model of government where individual rights are often subverted for the good of the masses, or the <a href="/wiki/Regime.html" title="Regime">regime</a> <sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a  title="">[26]</a></sup>. Robert Mugabe's approach to <a href="/wiki/Governance.html" title="Governance">governance</a> has prompted regular comparisons between him and <a href="/wiki/Pol_Pot.html" title="Pol Pot">Pol Pot</a> <sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a  title="">[27]</a></sup> <sup id="_ref-polpot_1" class="reference"><a  title="">[14]</a></sup>; <sup id="_ref-24" class="reference"><a  title="">[28]</a></sup>.</p>

<h2>Rebuttal from Zanu-PF</h2>
<p>In a 45-page response to the highly-critical report by UN envoy Anna Tibaijuka, President Robert Mugabe's government says it acted in the public interest, and denied that it was responsible for the deaths of several people during clean-up operation, and was carried out in compliance with the government's laws, the state-controlled Herald newspaper reported on <a href="/wiki/August_17.html" title="August 17">17 August</a> <a href="/wiki/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>.</p>
<p>The government said Tibaijuka had used <i>value-laden and judgemental language, which clearly demonstrated in-built bias</i> against it and the operation.</p>
