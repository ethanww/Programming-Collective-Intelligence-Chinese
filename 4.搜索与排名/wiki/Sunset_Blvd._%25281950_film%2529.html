The corpse of Joe Gillis floating in Norma Desmond's pool, in the film's opening scenes.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The opening scene reveals that a man has been killed, and his corpse is seen floating face down in a swimming pool. A <a href="/wiki/Narration.html" title="Narration">narrator</a> explains that the dead man was an unsuccessful screenwriter. The film fades into <a href="/wiki/Flashback_%28literary_technique%29.html" title="Flashback (literary technique)">flashback</a> as the narrator, now named as Joe Gillis, describes his attempt to flee by auto from two <a href="/wiki/Repossession.html" title="Repossession">repossession</a> agents. He turns into a driveway on Sunset Boulevard in order to escape them, and sees what he assumes to be a deserted mansion. He enters the house, where he meets a German butler and an eccentric older woman who mistakes him for an undertaker, visiting to arrange the funeral for her recently deceased pet chimpanzee. Gillis recognizes her as Norma Desmond, formerly one of the great stars of the silent screen. She offers him a job reading the script she has been writing for her planned comeback, and seizing a rare chance to make some money, he agrees.</p>
<p>Eventually, Gillis is completely financially dependent upon Norma, who lavishes attention on him and buys him expensive clothing; while he occasionally shows discomfort, he makes no effort to change his situation. He is horrified when Norma reveals on <a href="/wiki/New_Year%27s_Eve.html" title="New Year's Eve">New Year's Eve</a> that she is in love with him. Rejecting her attempt at seduction, he drives to a friend's house where a party is underway and speaks with a young woman named Betty who is interested in his writing. Inspired to continue his writing, he phones the Desmond house to say he is leaving, but is told Norma has attempted suicide. He rushes back to the mansion, where he comforts her and stays. The two seem relatively content as Norma continues working on her script. When she considers it to be complete, she sends it to <a href="/wiki/Paramount_Pictures.html" title="Paramount Pictures">Paramount Studios</a>. She receives telephone calls from <a href="/wiki/Cecil_B._DeMille.html" title="Cecil B. DeMille">Cecil B. DeMille</a>'s office at the studio and assumes he is interested in filming the project. She travels to the studio and meets with him; Gillis and the butler learn the studio only wants to hire Norma's vintage <a href="/wiki/Isotta-Fraschini.html" title="Isotta-Fraschini">Isotta-Fraschini</a> car for use in a film and has no interest in her script, but the two of them keep this from her. Joe begins secretly meeting with Betty to work on a screenplay and they fall in love. When Norma discovers this, she phones Betty and insinuates what sort of man Joe really is. Joe returns to the house in time to hear what Norma has said and takes the phone from her. He tells Betty to come to the house, where he explains his side of the situation before turning Betty away. Misunderstanding his actions, Norma is grateful to Joe, but he brushes her aside and begins packing to leave. Norma threatens to shoot him, but he does not take her seriously. As he walks away, she follows and shoots him several times before he falls dead into the pool.</p>
<p>Having explained the corpse in the pool, the film returns to the present, where Norma Desmond appears to be lost in fantasy. News cameras arrive to film her, and she thinks she is on the set of her new film. Norma slowly descends her grand staircase and, after making a speech declaring her happiness at making a new film (culminating in the film's most famous line: "All right, Mr DeMille, I'm ready for my close up".), she reaches for the camera, the screen fades to white and the narrator concludes that Norma's dream of performing for the cameras has in an unexpected way come true for her.<sup id="_ref-script_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[1]</a></sup></p>

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>The street after which the film is named has been associated with Hollywood film production since 1911 when the town's first film studio opened on <a href="/wiki/Sunset_Boulevard.html" title="Sunset Boulevard">Sunset Boulevard</a>. The film workers lived modestly in the growing neighborhood, but during the 1920s profits and salaries rose to unprecedented levels. With the advent of the "<a href="/wiki/Star_system_%28film%29.html" title="Star system (film)">star system</a>", luxurious homes noted for their often incongruous grandeur were built in the area. The stars were the subject of public fascination throughout the world as magazines and newspapers reported the excesses of their lives.</p>
<p>As a young man in <a href="/wiki/Warsaw.html" title="Warsaw">Warsaw</a>, <a href="/wiki/Poland.html" title="Poland">Poland</a>, Billy Wilder was interested in <a href="/wiki/United_States.html" title="United States">American</a> culture, with much of his interest fueled by American films. In the late 1940s many of the grand Hollywood houses remained, and Wilder, now a Los Angeles resident, found they were part of his everyday world. Many former stars from the silent era still lived in them, although most were no longer involved in the film business. Wilder wondered how they spent their time now that "the parade had passed them by" and began imagining the story of a star who had lost her celebrity and box-office appeal. <sup id="_ref-perry_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[2]</a></sup></p>

<p>In 1948 Wilder discussed the Norma Desmond character with <a href="/wiki/Greta_Garbo.html" title="Greta Garbo">Greta Garbo</a> (who had not made a movie since 1941) in the hope she might return to the screen. However, she expressed little interest. The role was then offered to <a href="/wiki/Mae_West.html" title="Mae West">Mae West</a> who declared herself too young to play a former silent-movie star. Wilder recalled that "in a bout of insanity" he and Brackett visited <a href="/wiki/Mary_Pickford.html" title="Mary Pickford">Mary Pickford</a>. She was interested but cautious and was ruled out when she disagreed with the storyline. They also approached <a href="/wiki/Pola_Negri.html" title="Pola Negri">Pola Negri</a> who "threw a tantrum at the mere suggestion of playing a has-been" and refused the role.<sup id="_ref-perry_1" class="reference"><a  title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p><a href="/wiki/George_Cukor.html" title="George Cukor">George Cukor</a> suggested Gloria Swanson. Wilder later commented they had not considered her because they thought she was "somehow unattainable." Swanson had been one of the most feted actresses of the silent-screen era, known for her beauty, talent and extravagant lifestyle. At the peak of her career in 1925 she was said to have received 10,000 fan letters in a single week and had lived on Sunset Boulevard in an elaborate Italianate palace from 1920 until the early 1930s. In many ways she resembled the Norma Desmond character and, like her, she had been unable to make a smooth transition into <a href="/wiki/Talking_pictures.html" title="Talking pictures">talking pictures</a>. The similarities ended there though, as Swanson accepted the end of her film career and in the early 1930s moved to <a href="/wiki/New_York_City.html" title="New York City">New York City</a> where she worked in <a href="/wiki/Radio.html" title="Radio">radio</a> and, from the mid 1940s, in <a href="/wiki/Television.html" title="Television">television</a>. Although Swanson was not seeking a comeback, she was intrigued when Wilder discussed the role with her. <sup id="_ref-perry_2" class="reference"><a  title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Swanson was chagrined at the notion of submitting to a <a href="/wiki/Screen_test.html" title="Screen test">screen test</a>, saying she had "made twenty films for Paramount. Why do they want me to audition?" Her reaction was later echoed in the screenplay when Norma Desmond declares, "without me there wouldn't be any Paramount." In her memoir Swanson recalled asking Cukor if it was unreasonable to refuse the screen test. He replied that Norma Desmond was the role for which she would be remembered. "If they ask you to do ten screen tests, do ten screen tests, or I will personally shoot you," Cukor replied. His enthusiasm convinced Swanson to participate. <sup id="_ref-swanson_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[3]</a></sup> In a 1975 interview Wilder recalled Swanson's reaction with the observation, "there was a lot of Norma in her, you know."<sup id="_ref-aboutfilmnoir_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Montgomery_Clift.html" title="Montgomery Clift">Montgomery Clift</a> was signed to play Joe Gillis but withdrew, likely due to concerns of unflattering comparisons with his real life, in which he was dating an older woman. Then <a href="/wiki/Fred_MacMurray.html" title="Fred MacMurray">Fred MacMurray</a> declined the role. William Holden, who had made an impressive debut in <i><a href="/wiki/Golden_Boy.html" title="Golden Boy">Golden Boy</a></i> (1939) and <i><a href="/wiki/Our_Town.html" title="Our Town">Our Town</a></i> (1940), followed by WWII military service and a modestly successful return to film in the late 1940s, accepted the part.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Erich_von_Stroheim.html" title="Erich von Stroheim">Erich von Stroheim</a>, a leading film director of the 1920s, who had directed Swanson, was signed to play Max, the faithful servant and Norma's protector. For the role of Betty Schaeffer, Wilder wanted a newcomer who could project a wholesome and ordinary image to contrast with Swanson's flamboyant and obsessive Desmond. He chose <a href="/wiki/Nancy_Olson.html" title="Nancy Olson">Nancy Olson</a>, who had recently been considered for the role of <a href="/wiki/Delilah.html" title="Delilah">Delilah</a> in DeMille's <i><a href="/wiki/Samson_and_Delilah_%28movie%29.html" title="Samson and Delilah (movie)">Samson and Delilah</a></i>. <sup id="_ref-staggs_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[5]</a></sup></p>

<p><a name="Writing" id="Writing"></a></p>
<h2>Writing</h2>
<p>Wilder and Brackett began working on a script in 1948 but the result did not completely satisfy them. In August 1948 <a href="/wiki/D.M._Marshman_Jr..html" title="D.M. Marshman Jr.">D.M. Marshman Jr.</a>, formerly a writer for <i><a href="/wiki/Life_Magazine.html" title="Life Magazine">Life Magazine</a></i>, was hired to help develop the storyline after Wilder and Brackett were impressed by a critique he provided of their film <i><a href="/wiki/The_Emperor_Waltz.html" title="The Emperor Waltz">The Emperor Waltz</a></i> (1948).</p>
<p>In an effort to keep the full details of the story from <a href="/wiki/Paramount_Studios.html" title="Paramount Studios">Paramount Studios</a> and avoid the restrictive <a href="/wiki/Censorship.html" title="Censorship">censorship</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Production_Code.html" title="Production Code">Breen Code</a> they submitted the script on an almost page-by-page basis. The Breen Office insisted certain lines be rewritten, such as Gillis' "I'm up that creek and I need a job," which became "I'm over a barrel. I need a job." Paramount executives thought Wilder was adapting a story called <i>A Can of Beans</i> (which did not exist) and allowed him relative freedom to proceed as he saw fit. Only the first third of the script was written when filming began in early May 1949 and Wilder was unsure how the film would end. <sup id="_ref-staggs_1" class="reference"><a  title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>The script contains many references to Hollywood and screenwriters, with Joe Gillis making most of the cynical comments. He sums up his film writing career with the remark, "The last one I wrote was about <a href="/wiki/Okie.html" title="Okie">Okies</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Dust_bowl.html" title="Dust bowl">dust bowl</a>. You'd never know because when it reached the screen, the whole thing played on a torpedo boat." In another exchange Betty comments to Gillis, "I'd always heard that you had some talent." He replies, "That was last year. This year I'm trying to make a living." <sup id="_ref-script_1" class="reference"><a  title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Several of Swanson's lines, such as, "All right Mr. De Mille, I'm ready for my close-up," and "I <i>am</i> big. It's the <i>pictures</i> that got small!" are widely remembered and quoted. Much of the film's wit is delivered through Norma Desmond's deadpan comments, which are often followed by sarcastic retorts from Gillis. Desmond appears to not hear some of these comments, as she is absorbed by her own thoughts, and so some of Gillis' lines are heard only by the audience, with Wilder blurring the line between the events and Gillis' narration. Gillis' response to Desmond's cry that "the pictures got small" is a muttered reply, "I knew there was something wrong with them." Wilder often varies the structure, with Desmond taking Gillis' comments seriously and replying in kind. An example is when the two discuss the overwrought script Desmond has been working on. "They'll love it in Pomona," observes Gillis. "They'll love it everyplace," replies Desmond firmly. <sup id="_ref-script_2" class="reference"><a  title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>In an essay about the screenplay, film writer Richard Corliss described <i>Sunset Boulevard</i> as "the definitive Hollywood horror movie," noting that almost everything in the script is "ghoulish." He remarked that the story is narrated by a dead man who Norma Desmond first mistakes for an undertaker, while most of the film takes place "in an old, dark house that only opens its doors to the living dead." He compared Von Stroheim's character Max with <i><a href="/wiki/The_Phantom_of_the_Opera.html" title="The Phantom of the Opera">The Phantom of the Opera</a></i>, and Norma Desmond with <a href="/wiki/Dracula.html" title="Dracula">Dracula</a>, noting that as she seduces Joe Gillis the camera tactfully withdraws with "the traditional directorial attitude taken towards Dracula's jugular seductions." He wrote that the narrative contains an excess of "cheap sarcasm" but ultimately congratulated the writers for attributing this dialogue to Joe Gillis, who was in any case presented as little more than a hack writer. <sup id="_ref-richardcorliss_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>Wilder preferred to leave analysis of his screenplays and films to others. Asked if <i>Sunset Boulevard</i> was a <a href="/wiki/Black_comedy.html" title="Black comedy">black comedy</a> he replied, "No, just a picture." <sup id="_ref-londonreviewofbooks_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[7]</a></sup></p>

<i>Sunset Boulevard</i> is notable for the atmospheric film noir cinematography of John F. Seitz. In this scene Norma Desmond is dramatically lit by a movie projector.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The film's dark, shadowy <a href="/wiki/Black-and-white.html" title="Black-and-white">black-and-white</a> film noir cinematography was the work of <a href="/wiki/John_F._Seitz.html" title="John F. Seitz">John F. Seitz</a>. Wilder had worked with him several times before, and trusted his judgment, allowing him the freedom to make his own decisions. Seitz recalled asking Wilder what he required for the pet monkey's funeral scene. Wilder replied, "you know, just your standard monkey funeral shot." For some interior shots Seitz sprinkled dust in front of the camera before filming to suggest "mustiness", a trick he had also used during production of <i><a href="/wiki/Double_Indemnity.html" title="Double Indemnity">Double Indemnity</a></i> (1944).</p>
<p>Wilder was adamant that the corpse of Joe Gillis be seen from the bottom of the pool, but creating the effect was difficult. The camera was placed inside a specially made box and lowered underwater, but the result disappointed Wilder, who insisted on further experiments. The shot was finally achieved by placing a mirror on the bottom of the pool and filming Holden's reflection from above with the distorted image of the policemen standing around the pool and forming a backdrop. <sup id="_ref-staggs_2" class="reference"><a  title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>Film historian Tom Stempel wrote, "In both <i>Double Indemnity</i> and <i>Sunset Boulevard</i>, Seitz does something that has always impressed me. Both are <a href="/wiki/Film_noir.html" title="Film noir">films noir</a>, and he finesses the fact that both are set in the sunniest of locales, <a href="/wiki/Los_Angeles%2C_California.html" title="Los Angeles, California">Los Angeles</a>... he brings together the light and the dark in the same film without any seams showing... he brings together the realistic lighting of Joe Gillis out in the real world with the <a href="/wiki/Gothic_architecture.html" title="Gothic architecture">gothic</a> look of Norma Desmond's mansion. Again with no seams showing." <sup id="_ref-staggs_3" class="reference"><a  title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Edith_Head.html" title="Edith Head">Edith Head</a> designed the costumes. Wilder, Head and Swanson agreed Norma Desmond would have kept somewhat up to date with fashion trends so Head designed costumes closely resembling the <a href="/wiki/Christian_Dior.html" title="Christian Dior">Dior</a> and <a href="/wiki/Coco_Chanel.html" title="Coco Chanel">Chanel</a> look of the mid-1940s. Embellishments were added to personalize them and reflect Norma Desmond's taste. Swanson recalled in her biography that the costumes were only "a trifle outdated, a trifle exotic." <sup id="_ref-swanson_1" class="reference"><a  title="">[3]</a></sup> Head later described her assignment as "the most challenging of my career," and explained her approach with the comment, "Because Norma Desmond was an actress who had become lost in her own imagination, I tried to make her look like she was always impersonating someone." Head later said she relied on Swanson's expertise because "she was creating a past that she knew and I didn't." <sup id="_ref-staggs_4" class="reference"><a  title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>Head also designed the costumes for William Holden and the minor characters but for authenticity, Wilder instructed Von Stroheim and Nancy Olson to wear their own clothing.</p>
<p>The musical score was created by <a href="/wiki/Franz_Waxman.html" title="Franz Waxman">Franz Waxman</a>. His theme for Norma Desmond was based on <a href="/wiki/Tango_music.html" title="Tango music">tango</a> music, inspired by her reference to dancing the tango with <a href="/wiki/Rudolph_Valentino.html" title="Rudolph Valentino">Rudolph Valentino</a>. This style was contrasted with Joe Gillis' <a href="/wiki/Bebop.html" title="Bebop">bebop</a> theme. Waxman also used distorted arrangements of popular film music styles from the 1920s and 1930s to suggest Norma Desmond's state of mind. The film's soundtrack was released on <a href="/wiki/Compact_disc.html" title="Compact disc">compact disc</a> for the first time in 2002.</p>
<p>The overstated decadence of Norma Desmond's home was created by set designer <a href="/wiki/Hans_Dreier.html" title="Hans Dreier">Hans Dreier</a>, whose career extended back to the silent era. He had also done the interior design for some movie stars' residences, including Mae West's. <a href="/wiki/William_Haines.html" title="William Haines">William Haines</a>, an interior designer and former actor, later defended criticism of Dreier's set design with the observation, "<a href="/wiki/Bebe_Daniels.html" title="Bebe Daniels">Bebe Daniels</a>, <a href="/wiki/Norma_Shearer.html" title="Norma Shearer">Norma Shearer</a> and <a href="/wiki/Pola_Negri.html" title="Pola Negri">Pola Negri</a> all had homes with ugly interiors like that." <sup id="_ref-staggs_5" class="reference"><a  title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>During filming considerable publicity was given to health-conscious Gloria Swanson's youthful appearance, which did not contrast enough with William Holden's mature looks. Wilder insisted the age difference be delineated and instructed <a href="/wiki/Makeup.html" title="Makeup">makeup</a> supervisor <a href="/wiki/Wally_Westmore.html" title="Wally Westmore">Wally Westmore</a> to make Swanson look older. Swanson argued that a woman of Norma Desmond's age, with her considerable wealth and devotion to self, would not necessarily look old, and suggested makeup be applied to Holden to make him appear younger. Wilder agreed and Westmore was assigned the task of making Holden appear younger, which allowed Swanson to portray Norma Desmond as a more sophisticated and glamorous figure than Wilder had originally anticipated. <sup id="_ref-staggs_6" class="reference"><a  title="">[5]</a></sup></p>

<p><a name="Touches_of_authenticity" id="Touches_of_authenticity"></a></p>
<h2>Touches of authenticity</h2>
<p>In dissecting Hollywood's "world of illusion" Wilder carefully placed the story within as authentic a setting as possible and made use of Hollywood history. Norma Desmond's name is believed to have been inspired by <a href="/wiki/William_Desmond_Taylor.html" title="William Desmond Taylor">William Desmond Taylor</a>, who had been murdered in 1922, and his close associate and friend <a href="/wiki/Mabel_Normand.html" title="Mabel Normand">Mabel Normand</a>, whose career was ruined by scandals surrounding the murder. <sup id="_ref-staggs_7" class="reference"><a  title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>Swanson was considered a fitting representative of Hollywood's past, remembered nostalgically by older fans but unknown to many younger movie viewers. Her personal collection of photographs decorated the set of Norma Desmond's home, causing Desmond's fictional past to resemble Swanson's authentic career. <sup id="_ref-staggs_8" class="reference"><a  title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>The script refers to real films such as <i><a href="/wiki/Gone_with_the_Wind_%28film%29.html" title="Gone with the Wind (film)">Gone with the Wind</a></i> and real people such as <a href="/wiki/Darryl_F._Zanuck.html" title="Darryl F.

<p>Wilder extended his Hollywood references into some of his casting choices. <a href="/wiki/Erich_von_Stroheim.html" title="Erich von Stroheim">Erich von Stroheim</a> was a leading director of the silent era. In the role of Max he watches a film with Norma Desmond and the briefly shown scene is from <i><a href="/wiki/Queen_Kelly.html" title="Queen Kelly">Queen Kelly</a></i> (1929), which von Stroheim himself directed with Swanson in the title role. Cecil B. De Mille (often credited as the person most responsible for making Swanson a star) plays himself, and was filmed on the set of his current film <i><a href="/wiki/Samson_and_Delilah_%28movie%29.html" title="Samson and Delilah (movie)">Samson and Delilah</a></i> at Paramount Studios. He calls Norma "young fellow," the nickname he had called Swanson, a tiny detail of authenticity suggested by De Mille.</p>
<p>Norma's friends who come to play bridge with her, though described only as "The Waxworks", are Swanson's contemporaries <a href="/wiki/Buster_Keaton.html" title="Buster Keaton">Buster Keaton</a>, <a href="/wiki/Anna_Q._Nilsson.html" title="Anna Q. Nilsson">Anna Q. Nilsson</a> and <a href="/wiki/H._B._Warner.html" title="H. B. Warner">H. B. Warner</a>, who, like De Mille, play themselves. (They are credited as doing so in the film's closing credits.) <a href="/wiki/Hedda_Hopper.html" title="Hedda Hopper">Hedda Hopper</a> also plays herself reporting on Norma Desmond's downfall in the film's final scenes. <sup id="_ref-staggs_9" class="reference"><a  title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>In a comic scene Norma Desmond performs a <a href="/wiki/Pantomime_%28theatre%29.html" title="Pantomime (theatre)">pantomime</a> for Joe Gillis as a <a href="/wiki/Mack_Sennett.html" title="Mack Sennett">Mack Sennett</a> "Bathing Beauty", in homage to Swanson's earliest film roles. She also performs a <a href="/wiki/Charles_Chaplin.html" title="Charles Chaplin">Charles Chaplin</a> impersonation identical to one she performed in the film <i><a href="/wiki/Masquerade.html" title="Masquerade">Masquerade</a></i> (1924).</p>
<p>Wilder also made use of authentic locales. Joe Gillis's home in the Alto-Nido apartments was a real apartment block located near Paramount Studios and often populated by struggling writers. The scenes of Gillis and Betty Schaefer on Paramount's backlot were filmed on the actual backlot and the interior of Schwab's <a href="/wiki/Drugstore.html" title="Drugstore">drugstore</a> was carefully recreated for several scenes. The exterior scenes of the Desmond house were filmed near around an old home on Wilshire Blvd. built during the 1920s, which by 1949 was owned by the former wife of <a href="/wiki/J._Paul_Getty.html" title="J. Paul Getty">J. Paul Getty</a>. The house is also featured in <i><a href="/wiki/Rebel_Without_A_Cause.html" title="Rebel Without A Cause">Rebel Without A Cause</a></i>.

<p>Wilder and Brackett were nervous about a major screening in Hollywood and decided to have the film preview in <a href="/wiki/Evanston%2C_Illinois.html" title="Evanston, Illinois">Evanston, Illinois</a>. The original edit opened with a scene inside a <a href="/wiki/Morgue.html" title="Morgue">morgue</a>, with the assembled corpses discussing how they had come to be there. Joe Gillis was one of the corpses and began telling about his murder. The audience reacted with laughter and seemed unsure whether to view the rest of the film as a drama or a comedy. After a similar reaction during its second screening the opening scene was deleted. The new edit was well-received in <a href="/wiki/Poughkeepsie%2C_New_York.html" title="Poughkeepsie, New York">Poughkeepsie, New York</a>.</p>

<p>Some critics accurately foresaw the film's lasting appeal. <i><a href="/wiki/The_Hollywood_Reporter.html" title="The Hollywood Reporter">The Hollywood Reporter</a></i> wrote that future generations would "set themselves the task of analyzing the durability and greatness" of the film while the magazine <i>Commonweal</i> said that in the future "the <a href="/wiki/Library_of_Congress.html" title="Library of Congress">Library of Congress</a> will be glad to have in its archives a print of <i>Sunset Boulevard</i>." <sup id="_ref-staggs_13" class="reference"><a  title="">[5]</a></sup></p>

<h2>After <i>Sunset Boulevard</i></h2>
<p><i>Sunset Boulevard</i> was the last collaboration between Wilder and Brackett. Their relationship was reportedly damaged by disputes over filming the montage scenes of Norma preparing her return to the screen. The film marked an approximate midpoint of Wilder's most successful years.</p>
<p>Charles Brackett's Hollywood career continued after his split with Wilder. He won an Academy Award for his screenplay for <i><a href="/wiki/Titanic_%281953_movie%29.html" title="Titanic (1953 movie)">Titanic</a></i> (1953), and wrote <i><a href="/wiki/Niagara_%28film%29.html" title="Niagara (film)">Niagara</a></i> (1953), which was the breakthrough film for <a href="/wiki/Marilyn_Monroe.html" title="Marilyn Monroe">Marilyn Monroe</a> as a dramatic actress. It was Wilder however, who realized Monroe's comedic abilities in <i><a href="/wiki/The_Seven_Year_Itch.html" title="The Seven Year Itch">The Seven Year Itch</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Some_Like_it_Hot.html" title="Some Like it Hot">Some Like it Hot</a></i>. Brackett's career waned by the end of the decade.</p>
<p>William Holden began receiving more important parts and his career rose. In 1953, he won the Best Actor Oscar for <i><a href="/wiki/Stalag_17.html" title="Stalag 17">Stalag 17</a></i> (also directed by Wilder) and by 1956 he was the number one box-office attraction in the United States.</p>
<p>Nancy Olsen's pairing with <a href="/wiki/William_Holden.html" title="William Holden">William Holden</a> was considered a success, thus she appeared opposite him in several films during the <a href="/wiki/1950s.html" title="1950s">1950s</a>, however none of them repeated their earlier success. Olson attempted to further her career, but was unsuccessful. <i><a href="/wiki/The_Absent-Minded_Professor.html" title="The Absent-Minded Professor">The Absent-Minded Professor</a></i> (1960) and <i><a  class="new" title="Son of Flubber">Son of Flubber</a></i> (1961) paired her with <a href="/wiki/Fred_MacMurray.html" title="Fred MacMurray">Fred MacMurray</a> and were popular with movie-goers, but after this her career stalled.</p>
<p>Gloria Swanson was not able to leverage her own success in <i>Sunset Boulevard</i>. Although offered scripts, she felt that they all were poor imitations of Norma Desmond. Imagining a career that would eventually reduce her to playing "a parody of a parody" she virtually retired from films. <sup id="_ref-perry_3" class="reference"><a  title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 1957 Swanson initiated discussions with Paramount Studios to adapt <i>Sunset Boulevard</i> into a musical called <i>Boulevard!</i> In her version the romance between Gillis and Shaefer was allowed to blossom and rather than shoot Gillis at the end, Norma gave the couple her blessing, sending them on their way to live "happily ever after." Swanson employed a songwriter and several songs were completed. Paramount Studios, who owned the copyright, encouraged Swanson to continue but withdrew its consent in 1959, saying it would not permit an interpretation that would damage the existing and future reputation of the film. It allowed television productions for <i><a href="/wiki/Lux_Video_Theatre.html" title="Lux Video Theatre">Lux Video Theatre</a></i> with <a href="/wiki/Miriam_Hopkins.html" title="Miriam Hopkins">Miriam Hopkins</a>, and <i><a href="/wiki/Robert_Montgomery_Presents.html" title="Robert Montgomery Presents">Robert Montgomery Presents</a></i> with <a href="/wiki/Mary_Astor.html" title="Mary Astor">Mary Astor</a> and <a href="/wiki/Darren_McGavin.html" title="Darren McGavin">Darren McGavin</a>, because the storyline remained faithful to the original script. <sup id="_ref-staggs_16" class="reference"><a  title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p><i>Sunset Boulevard</i> was shown in <a href="/wiki/New_York_City.html" title="New York City">New York City</a> in 1960 and drew such a positive response that Paramount arranged for a limited rerelease in theaters throughout the United States. It is arguably best known to modern audiences as a result of its television screenings since the 1960s. <sup id="_ref-perry_4" class="reference"><a  title="">[2]</a></sup></p>

<p>Polls conducted by the <a href="/wiki/American_Film_Institute.html" title="American Film Institute">American Film Institute</a> have demonstrated the lasting appeal of <i>Sunset Boulevard</i> and the esteem in which it is held by the modern filmmakers who respond to these polls.

<h2>Other films about Hollywood</h2>
<p>While Hollywood had been making films about itself since the 1920s many of them, such as <i><a href="/wiki/It%27s_a_Great_Feeling.html" title="It's a Great Feeling">It's a Great Feeling</a></i> (1949), were good-natured and fun. Others, such as <i><a href="/wiki/What_Price_Hollywood%3F.html" title="What Price Hollywood?">What Price Hollywood?</a></i> (1932) and <i><a href="/wiki/A_Star_Is_Born_%281937_film%29.html" title="A Star Is Born (1937 film)">A Star Is Born</a></i> (1937), hinted at the darker side of Hollywood without explicitly showing it. <i>Sunset Boulevard</i> is considered to be the first to employ such extreme cynicism. It was soon followed by <i><a href="/wiki/The_Bad_and_the_Beautiful.html" title="The Bad and the Beautiful">The Bad and the Beautiful</a></i> (1952), <i><a href="/wiki/Singin%27_in_the_Rain_%28film%29.html" title="Singin' in the Rain (film)">Singin' in the Rain</a></i> (1952) and the musical remake of <i><a href="/wiki/A_Star_Is_Born_%281954_film%29.html" title="A Star Is Born (1954 film)">A Star Is Born</a></i> (1954). Though none of them was as harshly self-critical, they each depicted the ease and cruelty with which Hollywood could discard a movie star past his or her prime.</p>
<p><i>Sunset Boulevard</i> was followed by other films which varied the story of an older actress desperately clinging to her past glory, such as <a href="/wiki/Bette_Davis.html" title="Bette Davis">Bette Davis</a> in <i><a href="/wiki/The_Star_%28film%29.html" title="The Star (film)">The Star</a></i> (1952) and <i><a href="/wiki/What_Ever_Happened_to_Baby_Jane%3F_%28film%29.html" title="What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?

The scenario of an older woman with a gigolo was also used as a storyline without the Hollywood setting in such films as <i><a href="/wiki/The_Roman_Spring_of_Mrs._Stone.html" title="The Roman Spring of Mrs. Stone">The Roman Spring of Mrs. Stone</a></i> (1961) which starred <a href="/wiki/Vivien_Leigh.html" title="Vivien Leigh">Vivien Leigh</a> and <a href="/wiki/Warren_Beatty.html" title="Warren Beatty">Warren Beatty</a>, while <a href="/wiki/Katharine_Hepburn.html" title="Katharine Hepburn">Katharine Hepburn</a>'s descent into madness in <i><a href="/wiki/Suddenly_Last_Summer.html" title="Suddenly Last Summer">Suddenly Last Summer</a></i> (1959) has been compared to Norma Desmond's final scene. <i><a href="/wiki/The_Day_of_the_Locust_%28film%29.html" title="The Day of the Locust (film)">The Day of the Locust</a></i> (1975) and <i><a href="/wiki/The_Last_Tycoon.html" title="The Last Tycoon">The Last Tycoon</a></i> (1976) depict Hollywood in bitter terms and, like <i>Sunset Boulevard</i>, make use of real backstage settings.</p>
<p>Among the more recent films to discuss <i>Sunset Boulevard</i> in their screenplays or imitate its scenes or dialogue are <i><a href="/wiki/Soapdish.html" title="Soapdish">Soapdish</a></i> (1991), <i><a href="/wiki/The_Player.html" title="The Player">The Player</a></i> (1992), <i><a href="/wiki/Gods_and_Monsters.html" title="Gods and Monsters">Gods and Monsters</a></i> (1998), <i><a href="/wiki/Mulholland_Drive_%28film%29.html" title="Mulholland Drive (film)">Mulholland Drive</a></i> (2001) <sup id="_ref-staggs_17" class="reference"><a  title="">[5]</a></sup> and <i><a href="/wiki/Be_Cool.html" title="Be Cool">Be Cool</a></i> (2005). The ending of <i><a href="/wiki/Cecil_B._Demented.html" title="Cecil B. Demented">Cecil B. Demented</a></i> (2000) is a parody of <i>Sunset Boulevard'</i>s famous final scene.</p>
<p>On television, the film inspired an episode of <i><a href="/wiki/The_Twilight_Zone.html" title="The Twilight Zone">The Twilight Zone</a></i>, "<a href="/wiki/The_Sixteen-Millimeter_Shrine.html" title="The Sixteen-Millimeter Shrine">The Sixteen-Millimeter Shrine</a>", in which an aging movie queen relives her past glory through watching her movies and at the same time isolating herself from the real world.</p>

<h2>The musical version</h2>
<p>A musical version (also titled <i><a href="/wiki/Sunset_Boulevard_%28musical%29.html" title="Sunset Boulevard (musical)">Sunset Boulevard</a></i>) with music by <a href="/wiki/Andrew_Lloyd_Webber.html" title="Andrew Lloyd Webber">Andrew Lloyd Webber</a> and book and lyrics by <a href="/wiki/Don_Black.html" title="Don Black">Don Black</a> and <a href="/wiki/Christopher_Hampton.html" title="Christopher Hampton">Christopher Hampton</a> opened in <a href="/wiki/London%2C_England.html" title="London, England">London, England</a> in 1993. The film had been originally meant to be adapted by <a href="/wiki/Stephen_Sondheim.html" title="Stephen Sondheim">Stephen Sondheim</a> but he gave it up after meeting Billy Wilder who proposed he write an opera instead of a musical. Then, <a href="/wiki/John_Kander.html" title="John Kander">John Kander</a> and <a href="/wiki/Fred_Ebb.html" title="Fred Ebb">Fred Ebb</a> were asked to do so. Finally Andrew Lloyd Webber took the opportunity to create a musical based on the film.</p>
<p>The production closely followed the film story, retained much of the dialogue and attempted to present similar set designs. Billy Wilder commented, "I congratulate [the writers] on something very ingenious — they left the story alone. A woman comes forward and says, 'I <i>am</i> big, it's the pictures that got small.' I was very much astonished when I heard the words, many of them retained and some of them to music. I'm not an expert on music but it sounded good to me." The show opened on <a href="/wiki/Broadway_theatre.html" title="Broadway theatre">Broadway</a> the following year. Among the actresses to play Norma Desmond were <a href="/wiki/Patti_Lupone.html" title="Patti Lupone">Patti Lupone</a>, <a href="/wiki/Elaine_Paige.html" title="Elaine Paige">Elaine Paige</a>, <a href="/wiki/Betty_Buckley.html" title="Betty Buckley">Betty Buckley</a> and <a href="/wiki/Petula_Clark.html" title="Petula Clark">Petula Clark</a> in London along with <a href="/wiki/Glenn_Close.html" title="Glenn Close">Glenn Close</a> and Betty Buckley in New York. <sup id="_ref-perry_5" class="reference"><a  title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>In July 2005 Lloyd Webber's <a href="/wiki/Really_Useful_Group.html" title="Really Useful Group">Really Useful Group</a> announced that a film version starring <a href="/wiki/Glenn_Close.html" title="Glenn Close">Glenn Close</a> and <a href="/wiki/Ewan_McGregor.html" title="Ewan McGregor">Ewan McGregor</a> was to be produced in association with Paramount and the Relevant Picture Company, with an expected release date of 2006, but the project has apparently been stalled or abandoned. <sup id="_ref-telegraph_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[24]</a></sup></p>

<h2>The name of the film</h2>
<p>Nearly all references give the name of the film as Sunset Boulevard. However, the opening sequence does not give a title. Instead, it has a shot of the road and zooms in on a street sign that says Sunset Blvd. Thus some authorities such as <a href="/wiki/Leonard_Maltin.html" title="Leonard Maltin">Leonard Maltin</a>'s <i>Film Guide</i> and the <a href="/wiki/IMDb.html" title="IMDb">IMDb</a> argue that it is the latter that is the true name of the film. However, "Sunset Boulevard" is the name given in the original <a href="/wiki/Theatrical_trailer.html" title="Theatrical trailer">theatrical trailer</a>.</p>
