In Cibber's <i>Love's Last Shift</i>, a free-living <a href="/wiki/English_Restoration.html" title="English Restoration">Restoration</a> <a href="/wiki/Rake.html" title="Rake">rake</a> is brought to repentance and reform by the ruses of his wife, while in <i>The Relapse</i>, the rake succumbs again to temptation and has a new love affair. His virtuous wife is also subjected to a determined seduction attempt, and resists with difficulty.</p>
<p>Vanbrugh planned <i>The Relapse</i> around particular <a href="/wiki/Actors.html" title="Actors">actors</a> at <a href="/wiki/Theatre_Royal%2C_Drury_Lane.html" title="Theatre Royal, Drury Lane">Drury Lane</a>, writing their stage habits, public reputations, and personal relationships into the text. One such actor was Colley Cibber himself, who played the luxuriant <a href="/wiki/Fop.html" title="Fop">fop</a> Lord Foppington in both <i>Love's Last Shift</i> and <i>The Relapse</i>. However, Vanbrugh's artistic plans were threatened by a cut-throat struggle between London's two theatre companies, each of which was "seducing" actors from the other. <i>The Relapse</i> came close to not being produced at all, but the successful performance that was eventually achieved in November 1696 vindicated Vanbrugh's intentions, as well as saving the company from <a href="/wiki/Bankruptcy.html" title="Bankruptcy">bankruptcy</a>.</p>
<p>Unlike <i>Love's Last Shift</i>, never again performed after the 1690s, <i>The Relapse</i> has retained its <a href="/wiki/Audience.html" title="Audience">audience</a> appeal. In the 18th century, however, its tolerant attitude towards actual and attempted <a href="/wiki/Adultery.html" title="Adultery">adultery</a> gradually became unacceptable to public opinion, and the original play was for a century replaced on the stage by <a href="/wiki/Richard_Brinsley_Sheridan.html" title="Richard Brinsley Sheridan">Sheridan</a>'s moralised version <i>A Trip to Scarborough</i> (1777).

<h3>Sexual ideology</h3>
<p><i>Love's Last Shift</i> can be seen as an early sign of Cibber's sensitivity to shifts of public opinion, which was to be useful to him in his later career as manager at Drury Lane (see <a href="/wiki/Colley_Cibber.html" title="Colley Cibber">Colley Cibber</a>). In the 1690s, the economic and political power balance of the nation tilted from the <a href="/wiki/Aristocracy.html" title="Aristocracy">aristocracy</a> towards the <a href="/wiki/Middle_class.html" title="Middle class">middle class</a> after the <a href="/wiki/Glorious_Revolution.html" title="Glorious Revolution">Glorious Revolution</a> of 1689, and middle-class values of religion, morality, and <a href="/wiki/Gender.html" title="Gender">gender</a> roles became more dominant, not least in attitudes to the stage. <i>Love's Last Shift</i> is one of the first illustrations of a massive shift in audience taste, away from the analytic bent and sexual frankness of <a href="/wiki/Restoration_comedy.html" title="Restoration comedy">Restoration comedy</a> and towards the conservative certainties and <a href="/wiki/Gender.html" title="Gender">gender</a> role <a href="/wiki/Backlash.html" title="Backlash">backlash</a> of exemplary or sentimental comedy. The play illustrates Cibber's opportunism at a moment in time before the change was assured: fearless of self-contradiction, he puts something into his first play to please every section of the audience, combining the old outspokenness with the new preachiness. The way Vanbrugh, in his turn, allows the reformed rake to relapse quite cheerfully, and has the only preaching in the play come from the comically corrupt parson of "Fatgoose Living", has made some early 20th-century critics refer to <i>The Relapse</i> as the last of the true Restoration comedies.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a  title="">[3]</a></sup> However, Vanbrugh's play is also affected by the taste of the 1690s, and compared to a play like the courtier <a href="/wiki/William_Wycherley.html" title="William Wycherley">William Wycherley</a>'s <i><a href="/wiki/The_Country_Wife.html" title="The Country Wife">The Country Wife</a></i> of 20 years earlier, with its celebration of predatory aristocratic masculinity, <i>The Relapse</i> contains quite a few moments of morality and uplift. In fact it has a kind of parallel structure to <i>Love's Last Shift</i>: in the climactic scene of Cibber's play, Amanda's virtue reforms her husband, and in the corresponding scene of <i>The Relapse</i>, it reforms her admirer Worthy. Such moments have not done the play any favours with modern critics.</p>

<p><a name="Love.27s_Last_Shift_plot" id="Love.27s_Last_Shift_plot"></a></p>
<h3><i>Love's Last Shift</i> plot</h3>
<p><i>Love's Last Shift</i> is the story of a last "shift" or trick that a virtuous wife, Amanda, is driven to in order to reform and retain her <a href="/wiki/Rake.html" title="Rake">rakish</a> husband Loveless. Loveless has been away for ten years, dividing his time between the brothel and the bottle, and no longer recognizes his wife when he returns to London. Acting the part of a high-class prostitute, Amanda lures Loveless into her luxurious house and treats him to the night of his dreams, confessing her true identity in the morning. Loveless is so impressed that he immediately reforms. A minor part that was a great hit with the première audience is the <a href="/wiki/Fop.html" title="Fop">fop</a> Sir Novelty Fashion, written by Cibber for himself to play. Sir Novelty flirts with all the women, but is more interested in his own exquisite appearance and witticisms, and Cibber would modestly write in his <a href="/wiki/Autobiography.html" title="Autobiography">autobiography</a> 45 years later, "was thought a good portrait of the foppery then in fashion". Combining daring sex scenes with sentimental reconciliations and Sir Novelty's buffoonery, <i>Love's Last Shift</i> offered something for everybody, and was a great box-office hit.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: The Relapse plot">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="The_Relapse_plot" id="The_Relapse_plot"></a></p>
<h3><i>The Relapse</i> plot</h3>
<p>Vanbrugh's <i>The Relapse</i> is less sentimental and more analytical than <i>Love's Last Shift</i>, subjecting both the reformed husband and the virtuous wife to fresh temptations, and having them react with more psychological realism. Loveless falls for the vivacious young widow Berinthia, while Amanda barely succeeds in summoning her virtue to reject her admirer Worthy. The three central characters, Amanda, Loveless, and Sir Novelty (ennobled by Vanbrugh into "Lord Foppington"), are the only ones that recur in both plays, the remainder of the <i>Relapse</i> characters being new.</p>
<p>In the <a href="/wiki/Trickster.html" title="Trickster">trickster</a> <a href="/wiki/Subplot.html" title="Subplot">subplot</a>, young Tom tricks his elder brother Lord Foppington out of his intended bride and her large <a href="/wiki/Dowry.html" title="Dowry">dowry</a>. This plot takes up nearly half the play and expands the part of Sir Novelty to give more scope for the roaring success of Cibber's fop acting. Recycling Cibber's merely fashion-conscious fop, Vanbrugh lets him buy himself a title and equips him with enough aplomb and selfishness to weather all humiliations. Although Lord Foppington may be "very industrious to pass for an ass", as Amanda remarks, he is at bottom "a man who Nature has made no fool" (II.i.148). Literary historians agree in esteeming him "the greatest of all Restoration fops" (Dobrée), "brutal, evil, and smart" (Hume).</p>

<h2>Background: theatre company split</h2>
<p>In the early 1690s, London had only one officially countenanced theatre company, the "United Company", badly managed and with its takings bled off by predatory investors ("adventurers"). To counter the draining of the company's income, the manager <a href="/wiki/Christopher_Rich.html" title="Christopher Rich">Christopher Rich</a> slashed the salaries and traditional perks of his skilled professional actors, antagonizing such popular performers as <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Betterton.html" title="Thomas Betterton">Thomas Betterton</a>, the tragedienne <a href="/wiki/Elizabeth_Barry.html" title="Elizabeth Barry">Elizabeth Barry</a>, and the comedienne <a href="/wiki/Anne_Bracegirdle.html" title="Anne Bracegirdle">Anne Bracegirdle</a>. However, the owners of the United Company, wrote <a href="/wiki/Colley_Cibber.html" title="Colley Cibber">Colley Cibber</a> in his autobiography, "who had made a <a href="/wiki/Monopoly.html" title="Monopoly">monopoly</a> of the stage, and consequently presumed they might impose what conditions they pleased upon their people, did not consider that they were all this while endeavouring to enslave a set of actors whom the public... were inclined to support." Betterton and his colleagues set forth the bad finances of the United Company and the plight of the actors in a "Petition of the Players" submitted to the <a href="/wiki/Lord_Chamberlain.html" title="Lord Chamberlain">Lord Chamberlain</a>. This unusual document is signed by nine men and six women, all established professional actors, and details a disreputable jumble of secret investments and "farmed" <a href="/wiki/Shares.html" title="Shares">shares</a>, making the case that owner chicanery rather than any failure of audience interest was at the root of the company's financial problems. Barely veiled <a href="/wiki/Strike_action.html" title="Strike action">strike</a> threats in the actors' petition were met with an answering <a href="/wiki/Lockout_%28industry%29.html" title="Lockout (industry)">lockout</a> threat from Rich in a "Reply of the Patentees", but the burgeoning conflict was pre-empted by a suspension of all play-acting from December until March 1695 on account of <a href="/wiki/Mary_of_England.html" title="Mary of England">Queen Mary</a>'s illness and death. During this interval, a <a href="/wiki/Cooperative.html" title="Cooperative">cooperative</a> actors' company took shape under the leadership of Betterton and was granted a Royal "licence to act" on <a href="/wiki/March_25.html" title="March 25">March 25</a>, to the dismay of Rich, who saw the threat too late.</p>
<p>The two companies which emerged from this labour/management conflict are usually known respectively as the "Patent Company" (the no longer united United Company) and "Betterton's Company", although Judith Milhous argues the latter misrepresents the cooperative nature of the actors' company. In the following period of intense rivalry, the Patent Company was handicapped by a shortage of competent actors. "Seducing" actors (as the legal term was) back and forth between the companies was a key tactic in the ensuing struggle for position, and so were appeals to the Lord Chamberlain to issue <a href="/wiki/Injunction.html" title="Injunction">injunctions</a> against seductions from the other side, which that functionary was quite willing to do. Later Rich also resorted to hiring amateurs, and to tempting Irish actors over from <a href="/wiki/Dublin.html" title="Dublin">Dublin</a>. But such measures were not yet in place for the staging of <i>The Relapse</i> in 1696, Rich's most desperate venture.</p>

<h2>Casting</h2>
<p>Vanbrugh is assumed to have attempted to tailor his play to the talents of particular actors and to what audiences would expect from them, as was normal practice (Holland), but this was exceptionally difficult to accomplish in 1695–96. <i>Love's Last Shift</i> had been cast from the remnants of the Patent Company—"learners" and "boys and girls"—after the walkout of the stars. Following the surprising success of this young cast, Vanbrugh and Rich had even greater difficulty in retaining the actors needed for <i>The Relapse</i>. However, in spite of the continuous emergency in which the <i>Relapse</i> production was mounted, most of Vanbrugh's original intentions were eventually carried out.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a  title="">[4]</a></sup></p>

</div>
</div>
<p>To cast <i>Love's Last Shift</i> in January 1696, the Patent Company had to make the best use of such actors as remained after the 1694 split (<i>see cast list right</i>). An anonymous contemporary pamphlet describes the "despicable condition" the troupe had been reduced to:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The disproportion was so great at parting, that it was almost impossible, in Drury Lane, to muster up a sufficient number to take in all the parts of any play; and of them so few were tolerable, that a play must of necessity be damned, that had not extraordinary favour from the audience. No fewer than sixteen (most of the old standing) went away; and with them the very beauty and vigour of the stage; they who were left being for the most part learners, boys and girls, a very unequal match for them that revolted.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a  title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The only well-regarded performers available were the Verbruggens, <a href="/wiki/John_Verbruggen.html" title="John Verbruggen">John</a> and <a href="/wiki/Susanna_Verbruggen.html" title="Susanna Verbruggen">Susanna</a>, who had been re-seduced by Rich from Betterton's company. They were of course used in <i>Love's Last Shift</i>, with John playing Loveless, the male <a href="/wiki/Leading_actor.html" title="Leading actor">lead</a>, and his wife Susanna the flirtatious heiress Narcissa, a secondary character. The rest of the cast consisted of the new and untried (for instance <a href="/wiki/Hildebrand_Horden.html" title="Hildebrand Horden">Hildebrand Horden</a>, who had just joined Rich's troupe, playing a rakish young lover), the modest and lacklustre (Jane Rogers, playing Amanda, and <a href="/wiki/Mary_Kent.html" title="Mary Kent">Mary Kent</a>, playing Sir Novelty's <a href="/wiki/Mistress_%28lover%29.html" title="Mistress (lover)">mistress</a> Flareit), and the widely disliked (the opportunist Colley Cibber, playing Sir Novelty Fashion); people who had probably never been given the option of joining Betterton. Betterton's only rival as male lead, <a href="/wiki/George_Powell.html" title="George Powell">George Powell</a>, had most likely been left behind by the rebels with some relief (Milhous); while Powell was skilled and experienced, he was also notorious for his bad temper and <a href="/wiki/Alcoholism.html" title="Alcoholism">alcoholism</a>. Throughout the "seduction" tug-of-war between Rich and Betterton in 1695–96, Powell remained at Drury Lane, where he was in fact not used for <i>Love's Last Shift</i>, but would instead spectacularly demonstrate his drinking problem at the première of <i>The Relapse</i>.</p>

</div>
<p>Vanbrugh planned <i>The Relapse</i>, too, round these limited casting resources and minor talents, which Peter Holland has argued explains the robust, farcical character of the play; Vanbrugh's second comedy, <i><a href="/wiki/The_Provoked_Wife.html" title="The Provoked Wife">The Provoked Wife</a></i> (1697), written for the better actors of the cooperative company, is a much subtler piece. <i>The Relapse</i> was written in six weeks and offered to the Patent Company in March,<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a  title="">[6]</a></sup> but because of the problems with contracting and retaining actors, it did not première until November. It is known from Cibber's autobiography that Vanbrugh had a decisive say in the ongoing casting changes made during these seven months; it is not known whether he altered his text to accommodate them.</p>
<p>To reinforce the connection with <i>Love's Last Shift</i> and capitalize on its unusual success, Vanbrugh designed the central roles of Loveless, Amanda, and Sir Novelty for the same actors: John Verbruggen, Jane Rogers, and Colley Cibber. Keeping Rogers as Amanda was not a problem, since she was not an actress that the companies fought over, but holding on to John Verbruggen and Colley Cibber posed challenges, to which Rich rose with energetic campaigns of bribery and re-seduction. Filling the rest of the large <i>Relapse</i> cast presented a varied palette of problems, which forced some unconventional emergency casting.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/John_Verbruggen.html" title="John Verbruggen">John Verbruggen</a> was one of the original rebels and had been offered a share in the actors' company, but became disgruntled when his wife <a href="/wiki/Susanna_Verbruggen.html" title="Susanna Verbruggen">Susanna</a>, a popular comedienne, was not. For Rich, it was a stroke of luck to get Susanna and John back into his depleted and unskilled troupe. John's availability to play Loveless remained precarious, however. In September, when <i>The Relapse</i> had still not been staged after six months of trying (probably because Rich was still parleying with Cibber about <i>his</i> availability as Lord Foppington), John was still complaining about his employment situation, even getting into a physical fight over it at the theatre. This misbehaviour caused the Lord Chamberlain to declare his contract void and at the same time order him to stay with the Patent Company until January 1697, to give Rich time to find a replacement. The original Loveless was thus finally guaranteed for an autumn season run of <i>The Relapse</i>. Since the loyal Verbruggen couple always moved as a unit, Susanna's services were also assured.</p>
<p>The Verbruggens were essential to the play, not least because Vanbrugh had customized the sprightly temptress Berinthia to Susanna's talents and reputation for witty, roguish, sexually enterprising characters, most recently Mrs Buxom in <a href="/wiki/Thomas_D%27Urfey.html" title="Thomas D'Urfey">Thomas D'Urfey</a>'s <i>Don Quixote</i> (a success thanks to "the extraordinary well acting of Mrs Verbruggen", wrote D'Urfey). Although John was less well-known, his acting skills were considerable and would flourish after January 1697 in the cooperative company, where commentators even started to compare him with the great Betterton. Verbruggen was considered a more natural, intuitive or "careless" actor, with "a negligent agreeable wildness in his action and his mien, which became him well".<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a  title="">[7]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Anthony_Aston.html" title="Anthony Aston">Anthony Aston</a> vividly described Verbruggen as "a little in-kneed, which gave him a shambling gait, which was a carelessness, and became him".<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a  title="">[8]</a></sup> Modern critics do not find the Loveless part very lively or irresistible, but Vanbrugh was able to count on Verbruggen's shambling male magnetism and "agreeable wildness" to enrich the character. This would originally have worked even in print, since cast lists were included in the published plays: most 1690s play readers were playgoers also, and aware of the high-profile Verbruggens. Happily married in private life and playing the secret lovers Loveless and Berinthia, the Verbruggens have left traces of their charisma and erotic stage presences in Vanbrugh's dialogue. <i>The Relapse</i> even alludes to their real-life relationship, in meta-jokes such as Berinthia's exclamation, "Well, he is a charming man! I don't wonder his wife's so fond of him!"</p>

<p><a href="/wiki/Hildebrand_Horden.html" title="Hildebrand Horden">Hildebrand Horden</a>, who had played a "wild" young lover in <i>Love's Last Shift</i>, was the only young, handsome, potential romantic <a href="/wiki/Leading_actor.html" title="Leading actor">lead</a> Rich had. He was presumably cast by Vanbrugh as Tom Fashion, Lord Foppington's clever younger brother (Holland), and it was a blow to the Patent Company when he was killed in a tavern brawl (more glamorously referred to as a "duel" in older sources) in May. At the première in November, Tom Fashion was instead played as a <a href="/wiki/Breeches_role.html" title="Breeches role">breeches role</a> by <a href="/wiki/Mary_Kent.html" title="Mary Kent">Mary Kent</a>, an unusual piece of emergency casting that puts a different face on a uniquely frank <a href="/wiki/Homosexual.html" title="Homosexual">homosexual</a> scene where Tom keeps skipping nimbly out of the way of the matchmaker Coupler's lecherous groping.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Colley_Cibber.html" title="Colley Cibber">Colley Cibber</a> was a rather unsuccessful young actor at the time of the split, with a squeaky voice and without any of the physical attractiveness of the soon-to-be-dead Horden. After the success of <i>Love's Last Shift</i>, his status was transformed, with both companies vying for his services as actor and playwright. He made an off-season transfer to Betterton's company in the summer of 1696 and wrote part of a play for the rebels before being re-seduced by Rich by means of a fat contract (Milhous). Cibber as Lord Foppington was thus also assured, and finally the première of <i>The Relapse</i> could be scheduled with some confidence. Cibber's performance in it was received with even greater acclaim than in his own play, Vanbrugh's Lord Foppington being a larger and, in the estimation of both contemporaries and modern critics, much funnier part than Sir Novelty Fashion. Vanbrugh's play incorporates some of the ad-libbing and affectations of Cibber's by all accounts inspired performance in <i>Love's Last Shift</i>. Cibber has thus imprinted not only his own playwriting but also his acting style and squeaky personality on Vanbrugh's best-known character.</p>
<p>Vanbrugh's <a href="/wiki/Preface.html" title="Preface">preface</a> to the <a href="/wiki/First_edition.html" title="First edition">first edition</a> preserves a single fleeting concrete detail about the première performance: <a href="/wiki/George_Powell.html" title="George Powell">George Powell</a> was drunk. He played Amanda's worldly and sophisticated admirer Worthy, the "fine gentleman of the play", and apparently brought an unintended hands-on realism to his supposedly suave seduction attempt:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One word more about the bawdy, and I have done. I own the first night this thing was acted, some indecencies had like to have happened, but it was not my fault. The fine gentleman of the play, drinking his mistress's health in <a href="/wiki/Nantes.html" title="Nantes">Nantes</a> brandy from six in the morning to the time he waddled upon the stage in the evening, had toasted himself up to such a pitch of vigour, I confess I once gave Amanda for gone.</p>

<p>The desperate straits of the United Company, and the success of <i>The Relapse</i> in saving it from collapse, are attested in a private letter from <a href="/wiki/November_19.html" title="November 19">November 19</a>, <a href="/wiki/1696.html" title="1696">1696</a>: "The other house [Drury Lane] has no company at all, and unless a new play comes out on Saturday revives their reputation, they must break." The new play is assumed to have been <i>The Relapse</i>, and it turned out the success Rich needed. "This play", notes Colley Cibber in his autobiography, "from its new and easy turn of wit, had great success, and gave me, as a comedian, a second flight of reputation along with it." <a href="/wiki/Charles_Gildon.html" title="Charles Gildon">Charles Gildon</a> summarizes: "This play was received with mighty applause."</p>
<p><i>The Relapse</i> is singled out for particular censure in the <a href="/wiki/Puritan.html" title="Puritan">Puritan</a> clergyman <a href="/wiki/Jeremy_Collier.html" title="Jeremy Collier">Jeremy Collier</a>'s anti-theatre <a href="/wiki/Pamphlet.html" title="Pamphlet">pamphlet</a> <i><a href="/wiki/Short_View_of_the_Immorality_and_Profaneness_of_the_English_Stage.html" title="Short View of the Immorality and Profaneness of the English Stage">Short View of the Immorality and Profaneness of the English Stage</a></i> (1698), which attacks its lack of <a href="/wiki/Poetic_justice.html" title="Poetic justice">poetic justice</a> and moral sentiment. Worthy and Berinthia, complains Collier, are allowed to enact their wiles against the Lovelesses' married virtue without being punished or losing face. The subplot is an even worse offence against religion and morality, as it positively rewards <a href="/wiki/Vice.html" title="Vice">vice</a>, allowing the trickster hero Tom to keep the girl, her dowry, and his own bad character to the end. Vanbrugh failed to take <i>Short View</i> seriously and published a joking reply,<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a  title="">[9]</a></sup> but Collier's censure was to colour the perception of the play for centuries. While it remained a popular stage piece through the 18th century, much praised and enjoyed for its wit, attitudes to its casual sexual morality became increasingly ambivalent as public opinion became ever more restrictive in this area, and more at odds with the permissive ethos of Restoration comedy. From 1777 Vanbrugh's original was replaced on the stage by <a href="/wiki/Richard_Brinsley_Sheridan.html" title="Richard Brinsley Sheridan">Sheridan</a>'s <i>A Trip to Scarborough</i>, a close adaptation but with some "covering", as the <a href="/wiki/Prologue.html" title="Prologue">prologue</a> explains, drawn over Vanbrugh's "too bare" wit:</p>
<dl>
<dd>As change thus circulates throughout the nation,</dd>
<dd>Some plays may justly call for alteration;</dd>
<dd>At least to draw some slender covering o'er,</dd>
<dd>That graceless wit which was too bare before.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Sheridan does not allow Loveless and Berinthia to <a href="/wiki/Consummation.html" title="Consummation">consummate</a> their relationship, and he withdraws approval from Amanda's admirer Worthy by renaming him "Townly". Some frank quips are silently deleted, and the <a href="/wiki/Matchmaker.html" title="Matchmaker">matchmaker</a> Coupler with the lecherous interest in Tom becomes decorous Mrs Coupler. A small-scale but notable loss is of much of the graphic language of Hoyden's nurse, who is earthy in Vanbrugh's original, genteel in Sheridan. However, Sheridan had an appreciation of Vanbrugh's style, and retained most of the original text unaltered.</p>

<p>In the 19th century, <i>A Trip to Scarborough</i> remained the standard version, and there were also some ad hoc adaptations that sidelined the Lovelesses' drawing-room comedy in favour of the Lord Foppington/Hoyden plot with its caricatured clashes between exquisite fop and pitchfork-wielding country bumpkins.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a  title="">[10]</a></sup> <i>The Man of Quality</i> (1870) was one such robust production, <i>Miss Tomboy</i> (1890) another. Vanbrugh's original <i>Relapse</i> was staged once, in 1846, at the Olympic Theatre in London.</p>
<p>During the first half of the 20th century <i>The Relapse</i> was relatively neglected, along with other <a href="/wiki/Restoration_drama.html" title="Restoration drama">Restoration drama</a>, and experts are uncertain about exactly when Vanbrugh's original again resurged to prominence on the stage and thereby marginalized Sheridan's version. These experts now believe the play may have been first brilliantly rehabilitated by <a href="/wiki/Anthony_Quayle.html" title="Anthony Quayle">Anthony Quayle</a>'s 1947 production at the Phoenix Theatre, starring <a href="/wiki/Cyril_Ritchard.html" title="Cyril Ritchard">Cyril Ritchard</a> as Lord Foppington and brought to <a href="/wiki/Broadway_theatre.html" title="Broadway theatre">Broadway</a> by Ritchard in 1950.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a  title="">[11]</a></sup> A <a href="/wiki/Musical_theater.html" title="Musical theater">musical</a> version, <i>Virtue in Danger</i> (1963), by <a href="/wiki/Paul_Dehn.html" title="Paul Dehn">Paul Dehn</a> and "John Bernard", opened to mixed reviews. <a href="/wiki/John_Russell_Taylor.html" title="John Russell Taylor">John Russell Taylor</a> in <i>Plays and Players</i> praised the cast, which included <a href="/wiki/Patricia_Routledge.html" title="Patricia Routledge">Patricia Routledge</a> as Berinthia and <a href="/wiki/John_Moffatt.html" title="John Moffatt">John Moffatt</a> as Lord Foppington, but complained that the production was "full of the simpering, posturing and sniggering which usually stand in for style and sophistication in Restoration revivals."<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a  title="">[12]</a></sup> Vanbrugh's original play is now again a favourite of the stage.

It must be noted, however, that actors were obscure people of low status at this time. This is especially true of the actors remaining at the Patent Company after all the stars had decamped to Betterton's cooperative company; except for Cibber, their birth dates are unknown and there is no portrait in existence of any of them. John Vanbrugh, later a famous architect, was likewise an obscure young man in 1696. Some of the motives of these all but unrecorded people remain irrecoverable; for example, there is no obvious reason why William Penkethman, a popular clown and funnyman, well-liked by his peers, who played Vanbrugh's Lory the pert valet, should have stayed with Rich and the Patent Company.</li>
