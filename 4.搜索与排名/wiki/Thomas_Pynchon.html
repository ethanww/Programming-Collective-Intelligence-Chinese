<h2>Biography</h2>
<p>Thomas Pynchon was born in 1937 in <a href="/wiki/Glen_Cove%2C_New_York.html" title="Glen Cove, New York">Glen Cove</a>, <a href="/wiki/Long_Island.html" title="Long Island">Long Island</a>, <a href="/wiki/New_York.html" title="New York">New York</a>, one of three children of Thomas Ruggles Pynchon, Sr. (1907-1995) and Katherine Frances Bennett (1909-1996). His earliest American ancestor, <a href="/wiki/William_Pynchon.html" title="William Pynchon">William Pynchon</a>, emigrated to the <a href="/wiki/Massachusetts_Bay_Colony.html" title="Massachusetts Bay Colony">Massachusetts Bay Colony</a> with the <a href="/wiki/Winthrop_Fleet.html" title="Winthrop Fleet">Winthrop Fleet</a> in 1630, and thereafter a long line of Pynchon descendants found wealth and repute on American soil. Pynchon's family background and aspects of his ancestry have provided source material for his fictions, particularly in the Slothrop family histories related in "The Secret Integration" (1964) and <i><a href="/wiki/Gravity%27s_Rainbow.html" title="Gravity's Rainbow">Gravity's Rainbow</a></i>.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Childhood and education">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Childhood_and_education" id="Childhood_and_education"></a></p>
<h3>Childhood and education</h3>
<p>Pynchon attended <a href="/wiki/Oyster_Bay%2C_New_York.html" title="Oyster Bay, New York">Oyster Bay</a> High School, where he wrote for the school newspaper and excelled in his studies. After graduating in 1953, he studied <a href="/wiki/Engineering_physics.html" title="Engineering physics">engineering physics</a> at <a href="/wiki/Cornell_University.html" title="Cornell University">Cornell University</a>, but left at the end of his second year to serve in the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Navy.html" title="United States Navy">U.S. Navy</a>. In 1957, Pynchon returned to Cornell to pursue a degree in English. His first published story, "The Small Rain", appeared in the <i>Cornell Writer</i> in May 1959, and narrates an actual experience of a friend who had served in the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Army.html" title="United States Army">army</a>; subsequently, however, episodes and characters throughout Pynchon's fiction draw freely upon his own experiences in the navy.</p>
<p>While at Cornell, Pynchon became a friend of <a href="/wiki/Richard_Fari%C3%B1a.html" title="Richard Fariña">Richard Fariña</a>, and both briefly led what Pynchon has called a "micro-cult" around <a href="/wiki/Oakley_Hall.html" title="Oakley Hall">Oakley Hall</a>'s <a href="/wiki/1958_in_literature.html" title="1958 in literature">1958</a> novel <i><a  class="new" title="Warlock (novel)">Warlock</a></i>. (He later reminisced about his college days in the introduction he wrote in 1983 for Fariña's novel <i><a  class="new" title="Been Down So Long It Looks Like Up to Me">Been Down So Long It Looks Like Up to Me</a>,</i> first published in 1966.) Pynchon also reportedly attended lectures given by <a href="/wiki/Vladimir_Nabokov.html" title="Vladimir Nabokov">Vladimir Nabokov</a>, who then taught literature at Cornell. While Nabokov later said that he had no memory of Pynchon (though Nabokov's wife, Vera, who graded her husband's class papers, commented that she remembered his distinctive handwriting), other of Pynchon's lecturers at Cornell recall him as being a gifted and exceptional student. Pynchon received his BA in June 1959.</p>

<h3>Early career</h3>
<p>After leaving Cornell, Pynchon began to work on his first novel. From February 1960 to September 1962, he was employed as a technical writer at <a href="/wiki/Boeing.html" title="Boeing">Boeing</a> in <a href="/wiki/Seattle%2C_Washington.html" title="Seattle, Washington">Seattle</a>, where he compiled safety articles for the <i>Bomarc Service News</i> (see <a  title="">Wisnicki 2000-1</a>), a support newsletter for the <a href="/wiki/Bomarc_Missile_Program.html" title="Bomarc Missile Program">BOMARC surface-to-air missile</a> deployed by the <a href="/wiki/U.S._Air_Force.html" title="U.S. Air Force">U.S. Air Force</a>. Pynchon's experiences at Boeing inspired his depictions of the "<a href="/wiki/Yoyodyne.html" title="Yoyodyne">Yoyodyne</a>" corporation in <i><a href="/wiki/V..html" title="V.">V.</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/The_Crying_of_Lot_49.html" title="The Crying of Lot 49">The Crying of Lot 49</a></i>, and both his background in physics and the technical journalism he undertook at Boeing provided much raw material for <i><a href="/wiki/Gravity%27s_Rainbow.html" title="Gravity's Rainbow">Gravity's Rainbow</a></i>. When it was published in <a href="/wiki/1963_in_literature.html" title="1963 in literature">1963</a>, Pynchon's novel <i>V.</i> won a <a href="/wiki/William_Faulkner_Foundation.html" title="William Faulkner Foundation">William Faulkner Foundation</a> Award for best first novel of the year.</p>
<p>After resigning from Boeing, Pynchon spent time in New York and Mexico before moving to California, where he was reportedly based for much of the 1960s and early 1970s, most notably in an apartment in <a href="/wiki/Manhattan_Beach%2C_California.html" title="Manhattan Beach, California">Manhattan Beach</a> (see <a  title="">Frost 2003</a>). In 1964, his application to study mathematics as a graduate student at the <a href="/wiki/University_of_California%2C_Berkeley.html" title="University of California, Berkeley">University of California, Berkeley</a>, was turned down (<a  title="">Royster 2005</a>). In 1966, he wrote a first-hand report on the aftermath and legacy of the <a href="/wiki/Watts_riots.html" title="Watts riots">Watts riots</a> in Los Angeles. Entitled "A Journey Into the Mind of Watts", the article was published in the <i><a href="/wiki/The_New_York_Times_Magazine.html" title="The New York Times Magazine">New York Times Magazine</a></i> (<a  title="">Pynchon 1966</a>).</p>
<p>From the mid-1960s Pynchon has also regularly provided <a href="/wiki/Blurbs.html" title="Blurbs">blurbs</a> and introductions for a wide range of novels and non-fiction works. One of the first of these pieces was a brief review of Hall's <i>Warlock</i> which appeared, along with comments by seven other writers on "neglected books", as part of a feature entitled "A Gift of Books" in the December 1965 issue of <i>Holiday</i>.</p>

Pynchon created the "muted post horn" as a symbol for the secret "Trystero" society in <i>The Crying of Lot 49</i>.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Pynchon's second novel, <i>The Crying of Lot 49</i>, is also set in California. It was published in <a href="/wiki/1966_in_literature.html" title="1966 in literature">1966</a>, and won the Richard and Hilda Rosenthal Foundation Award. Although more concise and linear in its structure than Pynchon's other novels, its labyrinthine plot features an ancient, underground mail service known as "The Tristero" or "Trystero", a parody of a <a href="/wiki/Revenge_play.html" title="Revenge play">Jacobean revenge drama</a> entitled "The Courier's Tragedy", and a corporate conspiracy involving the bones of <a href="/wiki/World_War_II.html" title="World War II">World War II</a> American <a href="/wiki/Government_Issue.html" title="Government Issue">GIs</a> being used as charcoal <a href="/wiki/Cigarette_filter.html" title="Cigarette filter">cigarette filters</a>. It proposes a series of seemingly incredible interconnections between these and other similarly bizarre revelations that confront the novel's protagonist, Oedipa Maas. Like <i>V.,</i> the novel contains a wealth of references to science and technology and to obscure historical events, and both books dwell upon the detritus of American society and culture. <i>The Crying of Lot 49</i> also continues Pynchon's habit of composing parodic song lyrics and punning names, and referencing aspects of <a href="/wiki/Popular_culture.html" title="Popular culture">popular culture</a> within his prose narrative. In particular, it incorporates several <a href="/wiki/The_Crying_of_Lot_49#Vladimir_Nabokov.html" title="The Crying of Lot 49">allusions</a> to Nabokov's <i><a href="/wiki/Lolita.html" title="Lolita">Lolita</a></i>.</p>
<p>In 1968, Pynchon was one of 447 signatories to the "Writers and Editors War Tax Protest". Full-page advertisements in <i><a href="/wiki/The_New_York_Post.html" title="The New York Post">The New York Post</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/The_New_York_Review_of_Books.html" title="The New York Review of Books">The New York Review of Books</a></i> listed the names of those who had pledged not to pay "the proposed 10% income tax surcharge or any war-designated tax increase", and stated their belief "that American involvement in Vietnam is morally wrong" (<a  title=""><i>New York Review of Books</i> 1968:9</a>).</p>

<h3><i>Gravity's Rainbow</i> and Pynchon's rise to prominence</h3>
<p>Pynchon's most celebrated novel is his third, <i><a href="/wiki/Gravity%27s_Rainbow.html" title="Gravity's Rainbow">Gravity's Rainbow</a></i>, published in <a href="/wiki/1973_in_literature.html" title="1973 in literature">1973</a>. An incredibly intricate and allusive fiction which combines and elaborates on many of the themes of his earlier work, including <a href="/wiki/Preterition.html" title="Preterition">preterition</a>, <a href="/wiki/Paranoia.html" title="Paranoia">paranoia</a>, <a href="/wiki/Racism.html" title="Racism">racism</a>, <a href="/wiki/Colonialism.html" title="Colonialism">colonialism</a>, <a href="/wiki/Conspiracy_theory.html" title="Conspiracy theory">conspiracy</a>, <a href="/wiki/Synchronicity.html" title="Synchronicity">synchronicity</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Entropy.html" title="Entropy">entropy</a>, the novel has spawned a wealth of commentary and critical material, including two reader's guides (<a  title="">Fowler 1980</a>; <a  title="">Weisenburger 1988</a>), books and scholarly articles, on-line concordances and discussions, and art works, and is regarded as one of the archetypal texts of American literary <a href="/wiki/Postmodern_literature.html" title="Postmodern literature">postmodernism</a>. The major portion of <i>Gravity's Rainbow</i> takes place in London and Europe in the final months of the <a href="/wiki/World_War_II.html" title="World War II">Second World War</a> and the weeks immediately following <a href="/wiki/Victory_in_Europe_Day.html" title="Victory in Europe Day">VE Day</a>, and is narrated for the most part from within the historical moment in which it is set. In this way, Pynchon's text enacts a type of <a href="/wiki/Irony.html" title="Irony">dramatic irony</a> whereby neither the characters nor the various <a href="/wiki/Narrator.html" title="Narrator">narrative voices</a> are aware of specific historical circumstances, such as the <a href="/wiki/Holocaust.html" title="Holocaust">Holocaust</a>, which are, however, very much to the forefront of the reader's understanding of this time in history. Such an approach generates dynamic tension and moments of acute self-consciousness, as both reader and author seem drawn ever deeper into the "<a href="/wiki/Plot.html" title="Plot">plot</a>", in various senses of that term. Encyclopedic in scope, the novel also displays enormous erudition in its treatment of an array of material drawn from the fields of <a href="/wiki/Psychology.html" title="Psychology">psychology</a>, <a href="/wiki/Chemistry.html" title="Chemistry">chemistry</a>, <a href="/wiki/Mathematics.html" title="Mathematics">mathematics</a>, <a href="/wiki/History.html" title="History">history</a>, <a href="/wiki/Religion.html" title="Religion">religion</a>, <a href="/wiki/Music.html" title="Music">music</a>, <a href="/wiki/Literature.html" title="Literature">literature</a> and <a href="/wiki/Film.html" title="Film">film</a>. Perhaps appropriately for a book so suffused with <a href="/wiki/Engineering.html" title="Engineering">engineering</a> knowledge, Pynchon reputedly wrote the first draft of <i>Gravity's Rainbow</i> in longhand on engineer's graph paper, in California and Mexico City.</p>
<p><i>Gravity's Rainbow</i> was a joint winner of the 1974 <a href="/wiki/National_Book_Award.html" title="National Book Award">National Book Award</a> for Fiction, along with <a href="/wiki/Isaac_Bashevis_Singer.html" title="Isaac Bashevis Singer">Isaac Bashevis Singer</a>'s <i>A Crown of Feathers and Other Stories</i>. In the same year, the fiction jury unanimously recommended <i>Gravity's Rainbow</i> for the <a href="/wiki/Pulitzer_Prize.html" title="Pulitzer Prize">Pulitzer Prize</a>; however, the Pulitzer board vetoed the jury's recommendation, describing the novel as "unreadable", "turgid", "overwritten", and in parts "obscene", and no prize was awarded (<a  title="">Kihss 1974</a>). In 1975, Pynchon declined the <a href="/wiki/William_Dean_Howells_Medal_of_the_American_Academy_of_Arts_and_Letters.html" title="William Dean Howells Medal of the American Academy of Arts and Letters">William Dean Howells Medal of the American Academy of Arts and Letters</a>.</p>

<h3>Post-<i>Gravity's Rainbow</i></h3>
<p>A collection of Pynchon's early short stories, entitled <i><a href="/wiki/Slow_Learner.html" title="Slow Learner">Slow Learner</a></i>, was published in <a href="/wiki/1984_in_literature.html" title="1984 in literature">1984</a>, with a lengthy <a href="/wiki/Autobiography.html" title="Autobiography">autobiographical</a> introduction. In October of the same year, an article entitled "Is It O.K. to Be a Luddite?" was published in the <i><a href="/wiki/New_York_Times_Book_Review.html" title="New York Times Book Review">New York Times Book Review</a></i>. In April 1988, Pynchon contributed an extensive review of <a href="/wiki/Gabriel_Garcia_Marquez.html" title="Gabriel Garcia Marquez">Gabriel García Marquéz's</a> novel, <i><a href="/wiki/Love_in_the_Time_of_Cholera.html" title="Love in the Time of Cholera">Love in the Time of Cholera</a></i>, to the <i>New York Times</i>, under the title "The Heart's Eternal Vow". Another article, entitled "Nearer, My Couch, to Thee", was published in June 1993 in the <i>New York Times Book Review</i>, as one in a series of articles in which various writers reflected on each of the <a href="/wiki/Seven_Deadly_Sins.html" title="Seven Deadly Sins">Seven Deadly Sins</a>. Pynchon's subject was "<a href="/wiki/Seven_Deadly_Sins#Sloth_.28Latin.2C_acedia.29.html" title="Seven Deadly Sins">Sloth</a>".</p>
<p>Pynchon's fourth novel, <i><a href="/wiki/Vineland.html" title="Vineland">Vineland</a></i>, was published in 1990, and was regarded as a disappointment by the majority of reviewers and critics. The novel is set in California in the 1980s and 1960s, and describes the relationship between an <a href="/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation.html" title="Federal Bureau of Investigation">FBI</a> <a href="/wiki/COINTELPRO.html" title="COINTELPRO">COINTELPRO</a> agent and a female radical filmmaker. Its strong socio-political undercurrents detail the constant battle between <a href="/wiki/Authoritarianism.html" title="Authoritarianism">authoritarianism</a> and <a href="/wiki/Communalism.html" title="Communalism">communalism</a>, and the nexus between <a href="/wiki/Resistance_movement.html" title="Resistance movement">resistance</a> and complicity, but with a typically Pynchonian sense of humor.</p>
<p>In 1988, he received a <a href="/wiki/MacArthur_Fellowship.html" title="MacArthur Fellowship">MacArthur Fellowship</a> and, since the early 1990s at least, many observers have mentioned Pynchon as a <a href="/wiki/Nobel_Prize.html" title="Nobel Prize">Nobel Prize</a> contender (see, for example, <a  title="">Grimes 1993</a>; <a  title="">CNN Book News 1999</a>; <a  title="">Ervin 2000</a>). Renowned American literary critic <a href="/wiki/Harold_Bloom.html" title="Harold Bloom">Harold Bloom</a> has named him as one of the four major American novelists of his time, along with <a href="/wiki/Don_DeLillo.html" title="Don DeLillo">Don DeLillo</a>, <a href="/wiki/Philip_Roth.html" title="Philip Roth">Philip Roth</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Cormac_McCarthy.html" title="Cormac McCarthy">Cormac McCarthy</a>.</p>
<p>Pynchon's fifth novel is <i><a href="/wiki/Mason_%26_Dixon.html" title="Mason &amp; Dixon">Mason &amp; Dixon</a></i>, a work which had been in the pipeline since 1978 at least (<a  title="">Roeder 1978</a>; see also <a  title="">Ulin 1997</a>). Published in <a href="/wiki/1997_in_literature.html" title="1997 in literature">1997</a>, the meticulously-researched novel is a sprawling <a href="/wiki/Postmodern_literature.html" title="Postmodern literature">postmodernist</a> saga recounting the lives and careers of the English astronomer, <a href="/wiki/Charles_Mason.html" title="Charles Mason">Charles Mason</a>, and his partner, the surveyor <a href="/wiki/Jeremiah_Dixon.html" title="Jeremiah Dixon">Jeremiah Dixon</a>, and the birth of the <a href="/wiki/American_Revolution.html" title="American Revolution">American Republic</a>.

<h3><i>Against the Day</i></h3>
<p>A variety of rumors pertaining to the subject matter of Pynchon's <a href="/wiki/Against_the_Day.html" title="Against the Day">next book</a> have circulated over a number of years. Most specific of these were comments made by the former German minister of culture, <a href="/wiki/Michael_Naumann.html" title="Michael Naumann">Michael Naumann</a>, who stated that he assisted Pynchon in his research about "a Russian mathematician [who] studied for <a href="/wiki/David_Hilbert.html" title="David Hilbert">David Hilbert</a> in <a href="/wiki/G%C3%B6ttingen.html" title="Göttingen">Göttingen</a>", and that the new novel would trace the life and loves of <a href="/wiki/Sofia_Kovalevskaya.html" title="Sofia Kovalevskaya">Sofia Kovalevskaya</a>. A July 2006 press release from <a href="/wiki/Penguin_Books.html" title="Penguin Books">Penguin Press</a> placed the new novel's publication date as 5 December 2006 (<a  title="">Getlin 2006</a>), and the as yet-untitled book was listed on <a href="/wiki/Amazon.com.html" title="Amazon.com">Amazon.com</a> as 992 pages in length. It was subsequently reported that the release date for the novel had been moved forward to 21 November and that the novel would be 1040 pages long.</p>
<p>A synopsis written by Pynchon himself appeared in July 2006 and was posted on Amazon, stating that the novel's action takes place between the <a href="/wiki/World%27s_Columbian_Exposition.html" title="World's Columbian Exposition">1893 Chicago World's Fair</a> and the time immediately following <a href="/wiki/World_War_I.html" title="World War I">World War I</a>, which would seem to rule out Kovalevskaya as the protagonist, as she had died in 1891. "With a worldwide disaster looming just a few years ahead," Pynchon writes in his <a href="/wiki/Blurb.html" title="Blurb">Book Description</a>, "it is a time of unrestrained corporate greed, false religiosity, moronic fecklessness, and evil intent in high places. No reference to the present day is intended or should be inferred." He promises cameos by <a href="/wiki/Nikola_Tesla.html" title="Nikola Tesla">Nikola Tesla</a>, <a href="/wiki/Bela_Lugosi.html" title="Bela Lugosi">Bela Lugosi</a> and <a href="/wiki/Groucho_Marx.html" title="Groucho Marx">Groucho Marx</a>, as well as "stupid songs" and "strange sexual practices" (<a  title="">Pynchon 2006</a>). Subsequently, the title of the new book was reported as <i><a href="/wiki/Against_the_Day.html" title="Against the Day">Against the Day</a></i> and a Penguin spokesperson confirmed that the synopsis was Pynchon's (<a  title="">Patterson 2006b</a>; <a  title="">Italie 2006</a>).</p>
<p>An <a href="/wiki/Against_the_Day#Extract.html" title="Against the Day">extract</a> from the forthcoming novel which appears in the Penguin Press catalog was posted to the Yahoo! <a href="/wiki/William_Gaddis.html" title="William Gaddis">William Gaddis</a> <a href="/wiki/Electronic_mailing_list.html" title="Electronic mailing list">mailing-list</a> discussion on August 4.</p>

<h2>Themes and influence</h2>
<p>Along with its emphasis on loftier themes such as <a href="/wiki/Racism.html" title="Racism">racism</a>, <a href="/wiki/Imperialism.html" title="Imperialism">imperialism</a> and <a href="/wiki/Religion.html" title="Religion">religion</a>, and its cognizance and appropriation of many elements of traditional <a href="/wiki/High_culture.html" title="High culture">high culture</a> and <a href="/wiki/Literature.html" title="Literature">literary</a> form, Pynchon's work also demonstrates a strong affinity with the practitioners and artifacts of <a href="/wiki/Low_culture.html" title="Low culture">low culture</a>, including <a href="/wiki/Comic_book.html" title="Comic book">comic books</a> and <a href="/wiki/Animated_cartoon.html" title="Animated cartoon">cartoons</a>, <a href="/wiki/Pulp_magazine.html" title="Pulp magazine">pulp fiction</a>, popular films, <a href="/wiki/Television.html" title="Television">television programs</a>, <a href="/wiki/Cookery.html" title="Cookery">cookery</a>, <a href="/wiki/Urban_myth.html" title="Urban myth">urban myths</a>, conspiracy theories, and <a href="/wiki/Folk_art.html" title="Folk art">folk art</a>. This blurring of the conventional boundary between "High" and "low" culture, sometimes interpreted as a "<a href="/wiki/Deconstruction.html" title="Deconstruction">deconstruction</a>", is seen as one of the defining characteristics of postmodernism.</p>
<p>In particular, Pynchon has revealed himself in his fiction and non-fiction as an aficionado of <a href="/wiki/Popular_music.html" title="Popular music">popular music</a>. Song lyrics and mock <a href="/wiki/Musical_theater.html" title="Musical theater">musical</a> numbers appear in each of his novels, and, in his autobiographical introduction to the <i><a href="/wiki/Slow_Learner.html" title="Slow Learner">Slow Learner</a></i> collection of early stories, he reveals a fondness for both <a href="/wiki/Jazz.html" title="Jazz">jazz</a> and <a href="/wiki/Rock_and_roll.html" title="Rock and roll">rock and roll</a>. The character McClintic Sphere in <i>V.</i> is a fictional composite of master jazz musicians such as <a href="/wiki/Ornette_Coleman.html" title="Ornette Coleman">Ornette Coleman</a>, <a href="/wiki/Charlie_Parker.html" title="Charlie Parker">Charlie Parker</a> and <a href="/wiki/Thelonious_Monk.html" title="Thelonious Monk">Thelonious Monk</a>. In <i>The Crying of Lot 49</i>, the lead singer of "The Paranoids" sports "a <a href="/wiki/The_Beatles.html" title="The Beatles">Beatle</a> haircut" and sings with an English accent. In the closing pages of <i>Gravity's Rainbow</i>, there is an apocryphal report that Tyrone Slothrop, the novel's protagonist, played <a href="/wiki/Kazoo.html" title="Kazoo">kazoo</a> and <a href="/wiki/Harmonica.html" title="Harmonica">harmonica</a> as a guest musician on a record released by <a  class="new" title="The Fool (band)">The Fool</a> in the 1960s (having <a href="/wiki/Magic_realism.html" title="Magic realism">magically</a> recovered the latter instrument, his "<a href="/wiki/Blues_harp.html" title="Blues harp">harp</a>", in a German stream in 1945, after losing it down the toilet in 1939 at the Roseland Ballroom in <a href="/wiki/Roxbury%2C_Massachusetts.html" title="Roxbury, Massachusetts">Roxbury</a>, <a href="/wiki/Boston%2C_Massachusetts.html" title="Boston, Massachusetts">Boston</a>, to the strains of the jazz standard 'Cherokee', upon which tune Charlie Parker was simultaneously inventing <a href="/wiki/Bebop.html" title="Bebop">bebop</a> in New York, as Pynchon describes). In <i>Vineland</i>, both Zoyd Wheeler and Isaiah Two Four are also musicians: Zoyd played keyboards in a '60s <a href="/wiki/Surf_music.html" title="Surf music">surf</a> band called "The Corvairs", while Isaiah played in a <a href="/wiki/Punk_rock.html" title="Punk rock">punk</a> band called "Billy Barf and the Vomitones". In <i>Mason &amp; Dixon</i>, one of the characters plays on the "Clavier" the varsity drinking song which will later become "<a href="/wiki/The_Star-Spangled_Banner.html" title="The Star-Spangled Banner">The Star-Spangled Banner</a>".</p>
<p>In his <i><a href="/wiki/Slow_Learner.html" title="Slow Learner">Slow Learner</a></i> introduction, Pynchon acknowledges a debt to the anarchic bandleader <a href="/wiki/Spike_Jones.html" title="Spike Jones">Spike Jones</a>, and in 1994, he penned a 3000-word set of <a href="/wiki/Liner_notes.html" title="Liner notes">liner notes</a> for the album <i>Spiked!</i>, a collection of Jones's recordings released on the short-lived BMG Catalyst label. Pynchon also wrote the liner notes for <i>Nobody's Cool</i>, the second album of <a href="/wiki/Indie_rock.html" title="Indie rock">indie rock</a> band <a  class="new" title="Lotion (band)">Lotion</a>, in which he states that "rock and roll remains one of the last honorable callings, and a working band is a miracle of everyday life. Which is basically what these guys do." He is also known to be a fan of <a href="/wiki/Roky_Erickson.html" title="Roky Erickson">Roky Erickson</a>.</p>
<p>In terms of literary influences and affinity, an eclectic catalogue of Pynchonian precursors has been proposed by readers and critics.

One of his earliest short stories, "Low-lands" (1960), features a meditation on <a href="/wiki/Werner_Heisenberg.html" title="Werner Heisenberg">Heisenberg's</a> <a href="/wiki/Uncertainty_principle.html" title="Uncertainty principle">uncertainty principle</a> as a metaphor for telling stories about one's own experiences. His next published work, "Entropy" (1960), introduced <a href="/wiki/Entropy.html" title="Entropy">the concept</a> which was to become synonymous with Pynchon's name (though Pynchon later admitted the "shallowness of [his] understanding" of the subject, and noted that choosing an abstract concept first and trying to construct a narrative around it was "a lousy way to go about writing a story"). Another early story, "Under the Rose" (1961), includes amongst its cast of characters a <a href="/wiki/Cyborg.html" title="Cyborg">cyborg</a> set anachronistically in <a href="/wiki/Victorian-era.html" title="Victorian-era">Victorian-era</a> <a href="/wiki/Egypt.html" title="Egypt">Egypt</a> (a type of writing now called <a href="/wiki/Steampunk.html" title="Steampunk">steampunk</a>). This story, significantly reworked by Pynchon, appears as Chapter 3 of <i>V.</i> "The Secret Integration" (1964), Pynchon's last published short story, is a sensitively-handled <a href="/wiki/Coming-of-age.html" title="Coming-of-age">coming-of-age</a> tale in which a group of young boys face the consequences of the American policy of <a href="/wiki/Racial_integration.html" title="Racial integration">racial integration</a>. At one point in the story, the boys attempt to understand the new policy by way of the <a href="/wiki/Antiderivative.html" title="Antiderivative">mathematical operation</a>, the only sense of the word with which they are familiar.</p>
<p><i>The Crying of Lot 49</i> also alludes to entropy and <a href="/wiki/Communication_theory.html" title="Communication theory">communication theory</a>, and contains scenes and descriptions which parody or appropriate <a href="/wiki/Calculus.html" title="Calculus">calculus</a>, <a href="/wiki/Zeno%27s_paradoxes.html" title="Zeno's paradoxes">Zeno's paradoxes</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/Thought_experiment.html" title="Thought experiment">thought experiment</a> known as <a href="/wiki/Maxwell%27s_demon.html" title="Maxwell's demon">Maxwell's demon</a>. At the same time, the novel also investigates <a href="/wiki/Homosexuality.html" title="Homosexuality">homosexuality</a>, <a href="/wiki/Celibacy.html" title="Celibacy">celibacy</a> and both medically-sanctioned and illicit <a href="/wiki/Psychedelic_drug.html" title="Psychedelic drug">psychedelic drug</a> use. <i>Gravity's Rainbow</i> describes many varieties of sexual <a href="/wiki/Fetish.html" title="Fetish">fetishism</a> (including <a href="/wiki/Sado-masochism.html" title="Sado-masochism">sado-masochism</a>, <a href="/wiki/Coprophilia.html" title="Coprophilia">coprophilia</a> and a borderline case of <a href="/wiki/Tentacle_rape.html" title="Tentacle rape">tentacle rape</a>), and features numerous episodes of drug use, most notably <a href="/wiki/Marijuana.html" title="Marijuana">marijuana</a> but also <a href="/wiki/Cocaine.html" title="Cocaine">cocaine</a>, naturally occurring <a href="/wiki/Hallucinogen.html" title="Hallucinogen">hallucinogens</a>, and the mushroom <i><a href="/wiki/Amanita_muscaria.html" title="Amanita muscaria">Amanita muscaria</a>.</i> <i>Gravity's Rainbow</i> also derives much from Pynchon's background in mathematics: at one point, the geometry of garter belts is compared with that of <a href="/wiki/Cathedral.html" title="Cathedral">cathedral</a> spires, both described as mathematical <a href="/wiki/Singularity.html" title="Singularity">singularities</a>. His most recent novel, <i>Mason &amp; Dixon</i>, explores the scientific, theological, and sociocultural foundations of the <a href="/wiki/Age_of_Enlightenment.html" title="Age of Enlightenment">Age of Reason</a> whilst also depicting the relationships between actual historical figures and fictional characters in intricate detail and, like <i>Gravity's Rainbow</i>, is an archetypal example of the genre of <a href="/wiki/Historiographical_metafiction.html" title="Historiographical metafiction">historiographical metafiction</a>.</p>
<p>Pynchon's work has been cited as an influence and inspiration by many writers, musicians, artists and filmmakers, including <a href="/wiki/T._Coraghessan_Boyle.html" title="T. Coraghessan Boyle">T. Coraghessan Boyle</a>, <a href="/wiki/Don_DeLillo.html" title="Don DeLillo">Don DeLillo</a>, <a href="/wiki/Paul_Di_Filippo.html" title="Paul Di Filippo">Paul Di Filippo</a>, <a href="/wiki/William_Gibson_%28novelist%29.html" title="William Gibson (novelist)">William Gibson</a>, <a href="/wiki/Elfriede_Jelinek.html" title="Elfriede Jelinek">Elfriede Jelinek</a>, <a href="/wiki/Rick_Moody.html" title="Rick Moody">Rick Moody</a>, <a href="/wiki/Arturo_Perez-Reverte.html" title="Arturo Perez-Reverte">Arturo Perez-Reverte</a>, <a href="/wiki/Richard_Powers.html" title="Richard Powers">Richard Powers</a>, <a href="/wiki/Salman_Rushdie.html" title="Salman Rushdie">Salman Rushdie</a>, <a href="/wiki/Neal_Stephenson.html" title="Neal Stephenson">Neal Stephenson</a>, <a href="/wiki/Bruce_Sterling.html" title="Bruce Sterling">Bruce Sterling</a>, <a href="/wiki/Laurie_Anderson.html" title="Laurie Anderson">Laurie Anderson</a>, the rapper <a href="/wiki/El-P.html" title="El-P">El-P</a>, <a  class="new" title="Max P.

Thanks to his influence on Gibson and Stephenson in particular, Pynchon became one of the progenitors of <a href="/wiki/Cyberpunk.html" title="Cyberpunk">cyberpunk</a> fiction. Though the term "cyberpunk" did not become prevalent until the early 1980s, many readers retroactively include <i>Gravity's Rainbow</i> in the genre, along with other works—<i>e.g.,</i> <a href="/wiki/Samuel_R._Delany.html" title="Samuel R. Delany">Samuel R. Delany</a>'s <i><a href="/wiki/Nova_%28novel%29.html" title="Nova (novel)">Nova</a></i> and many works of <a href="/wiki/Philip_K._Dick.html" title="Philip K. Dick">Philip K. Dick</a>—which seem, after the fact, to anticipate cyberpunk styles and themes. The <a href="/wiki/Encyclopedia.html" title="Encyclopedia">encyclopedic</a> nature of Pynchon's novels also led to some attempts to link his work with the short-lived <a href="/wiki/Hypertext_fiction.html" title="Hypertext fiction">hypertext fiction</a> movement of the 1990s (<a  title="">Page 2002</a>; <a  title="">Krämer 2005</a>).</p>
<p><i>Gravity's Rainbow</i> and the more recent <i>Mason &amp; Dixon</i> both feature wildly eccentric characters, episodes of frenzied action and frequent digressions on topics which are seemingly tangential to the central narrative. These characteristics, combined with the novels' imposing lengths, have led critic <a href="/wiki/James_Wood_%28critic%29.html" title="James Wood (critic)">James Wood</a> to classify Pynchon's work as <a href="/wiki/Hysterical_realism.html" title="Hysterical realism">hysterical realism</a>. Other writers whose work has been labelled as hysterical realism include Rushdie, Stephenson, Wunderlee and <a href="/wiki/Zadie_Smith.html" title="Zadie Smith">Zadie Smith</a>.</p>

<h2>Media scrutiny</h2>
<p>Relatively little is known about Thomas Pynchon as a private person; he has carefully avoided contact with journalists for more than forty years. Only a few photos of him are known to exist, nearly all from his high school and college days, and his whereabouts have often remained undisclosed.</p>
<p>A review of <i>V.</i> in the <i><a href="/wiki/New_York_Times_Book_Review.html" title="New York Times Book Review">New York Times Book Review</a></i> described Pynchon as "a recluse" living in Mexico, thereby introducing the <a href="/wiki/Mass_media.html" title="Mass media">media</a> label which has pursued Pynchon throughout his career (<a  title="">Plimpton 1963</a>: 5). Nonetheless, Pynchon's absence from the public spotlight is one of the notable features of his life, and it has generated many rumors and apocryphal anecdotes.</p>

<h3>1970s and 1980s</h3>
<p>After the publication and success of <i>Gravity's Rainbow</i>, interest mounted in finding out more about the identity of the author. At the 1974 <a href="/wiki/National_Book_Award.html" title="National Book Award">National Book Award</a> ceremony, the president of <a href="/wiki/Viking_Press.html" title="Viking Press">Viking Press</a>, Tom Guinzberg, arranged for double-talking comedian <a href="/wiki/Irwin_Corey.html" title="Irwin Corey">"Professor" Irwin Corey</a> to accept the prize on Pynchon's behalf (Royster 2005). Many of the assembled guests had no idea who Corey was, and, having never seen the author, they assumed that it was Pynchon himself on the stage delivering Corey's trademark torrent of rambling, pseudo-scholarly verbiage (<a  title="">Corey 1974</a>). Towards the end of Corey's address a streaker ran through the hall, adding further to the confusion.</p>
<p>An article published in the <i>Soho Weekly News</i> claimed that Pynchon was in fact <a href="/wiki/J._D._Salinger.html" title="J. D. Salinger">J. D. Salinger</a> (<a  title="">Batchelor 1976</a>). Pynchon's written response to this theory (reported in <a  title="">Tanner 1982</a>) was simple: "Not bad. Keep trying."</p>
<p>Thereafter, the first piece to provide substantial information about Pynchon's personal life was a biographical account written by a former Cornell University friend, <a href="/wiki/Jules_Siegel.html" title="Jules Siegel">Jules Siegel</a>, and published in <i><a href="/wiki/Playboy.html" title="Playboy">Playboy</a></i> magazine. In his article, Siegel reveals that Pynchon had a <a href="/wiki/Complex_%28psychology%29.html" title="Complex (psychology)">complex</a> about his teeth and underwent extensive and painful reconstructive surgery, was nicknamed "Tom" at Cornell and attended <a href="/wiki/Mass_%28liturgy%29.html" title="Mass (liturgy)">Mass</a> diligently, acted as <a href="/wiki/Best_man.html" title="Best man">best man</a> at Siegel's wedding, and that he later also had an affair with Siegel's wife. Siegel recalls Pynchon saying he did attend some of <a href="/wiki/Vladimir_Nabokov.html" title="Vladimir Nabokov">Vladimir Nabokov</a>'s lectures at Cornell but that he could hardly make out what Nabokov was saying because of his thick Russian accent. Siegel also records Pynchon's comment that "[e]very weirdo in the world is on my wavelength", an observation borne out by the <a href="/wiki/Crank_%28person%29.html" title="Crank (person)">crankiness</a> and <a href="/wiki/Zealot.html" title="Zealot">zealotry</a> which has attached itself to his name and work in subsequent years, particularly across the <a href="/wiki/Internet.html" title="Internet">Internet</a> (<a  title="">Siegel 1977</a>).</p>

<h3>1990s and 2000s</h3>
<p>Pynchon's avoidance of <a href="/wiki/Celebrity.html" title="Celebrity">celebrity</a> and public appearances caused journalists to continue to speculate about his identity and activities, and reinforced his reputation within the media as "reclusive". More astute readers and critics recognized that there were and are perhaps aesthetic (and ideological) motivations behind his choice to remain aloof from public life. For example, the protagonist in <a href="/wiki/Janette_Turner_Hospital.html" title="Janette Turner Hospital">Janette Turner Hospital</a>'s short story, "For Mr. Voss or Occupant" (publ. 1991), explains to her daughter that she is writing</p>
<dl>
<dd>a study of authors who become reclusive. <a href="/wiki/Patrick_White.html" title="Patrick White">Patrick White</a>, <a href="/wiki/Emily_Dickinson.html" title="Emily Dickinson">Emily Dickinson</a>, <a href="/wiki/J._D._Salinger.html" title="J. D. Salinger">J. D. Salinger</a>, Thomas Pynchon. The way they create solitary characters and <a href="/wiki/Persona.html" title="Persona">personae</a> and then disappear into their fictions. (<a  title="">Hospital 1995</a>: 361-2)</dd>
</dl>
<p>More recently, book critic Arthur Salm has written that</p>
<dl>
<dd>the man simply chooses not to be a public figure, an attitude that resonates on a frequency so out of phase with that of the prevailing culture that if Pynchon and <a href="/wiki/Paris_Hilton.html" title="Paris Hilton">Paris Hilton</a> were ever to meet—the circumstances, I admit, are beyond imagining—the resulting matter/<a href="/wiki/Antimatter.html" title="Antimatter">antimatter</a> explosion would vaporize everything from here to <a href="/wiki/Tau_Ceti.html" title="Tau Ceti">Tau Ceti</a> IV. (<a  title="">Salm 2004</a>)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Belying this reputation somewhat, Pynchon has published a number of articles and reviews in the mainstream American media, including words of support for <a href="/wiki/Salman_Rushdie.html" title="Salman Rushdie">Salman Rushdie</a> and his then-wife, Marianne Wiggins, after the <a href="/wiki/Fatwa.html" title="Fatwa">fatwa</a> was pronounced <a href="/wiki/Salman_Rushdie#The_Satanic_Verses_controversy.html" title="Salman Rushdie">against Rushdie</a> by the <a href="/wiki/Iran.html" title="Iran">Iranian</a> leader, <a href="/wiki/Ayatollah_Ruhollah_Khomeini.html" title="Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini">Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini</a> (<a  title="">Pynchon 1989</a>). In the following year, Rushdie's enthusiastic review of Pynchon's <i>Vineland</i> prompted Pynchon to send him another message hinting that if Rushdie were ever in <a href="/wiki/New_York_City.html" title="New York City">New York</a>, the two should arrange a meeting. Eventually, the two did meet, and Rushdie found himself surprised by how much Pynchon resembled the mental image Rushdie had formed beforehand (<a  title="">Hitchens 1997</a>).</p>
<p>In the early 1990s, Pynchon married his literary agent, Melanie Jackson, and fathered a son, Jackson, in 1991. The disclosure of Pynchon's location in New York, after many years in which he was believed to be dividing his time between <a href="/wiki/Mexico.html" title="Mexico">Mexico</a> and northern California, led some journalists and photographers to try to track him down. Shortly before the publication of <i>Mason &amp; Dixon</i> in 1997, a <a href="/wiki/CNN.html" title="CNN">CNN</a> camera crew filmed him in <a href="/wiki/Manhattan.html" title="Manhattan">Manhattan</a>. Angered by this invasion of his privacy, he rang CNN asking that he not be identified in the footage of the street scenes near his home. When asked about his reclusive nature, he remarked, "My belief is that 'recluse' is a code word generated by journalists ... meaning, 'doesn't like to talk to reporters'." CNN also quoted him as saying, "Let me be unambiguous. I prefer not to be photographed." (<a  title="">CNN 1997</a>) The next year, a reporter for the <i><a href="/wiki/Sunday_Times_%28South_Africa%29.html" title="Sunday Times (South Africa)">Sunday Times</a></i> managed to snap a photo of him as he was walking with his son (<a  title="">Bone 1998</a>).</p>
<p>After several references to Pynchon's work and reputation were made on <a href="/wiki/NBC.html" title="NBC">NBC</a>'s <i><a href="/wiki/The_John_Larroquette_Show.html" title="The John Larroquette Show">The John Larroquette Show</a>,</i> Pynchon (through his agent) reportedly contacted the show's producers to offer suggestions and corrections. When a local Pynchon sighting became a major plot point in a 1994 episode of the show, Pynchon was sent the script for his approval; as well as providing the title of a fictitious work to be used in one episode ("Pandemonium of the Sun"), the novelist apparently vetoed a final scene that called for an extra playing him to be filmed from behind, walking away from shot (<a  title="">CNN 1997</a>; <a  title="">Glenn 2003</a>). Also during the 1990s, Pynchon apparently befriended members of the band <a  class="new" title="Lotion (band)">Lotion</a> and attended a number of their shows, culminating in the liner notes he contributed for the band's 1995 album <i>Nobody's Cool</i>. The novelist then conducted an interview with the band ("Lunch With Lotion") for <i>Esquire</i> in June 1996 in the lead-up to the publication of <i>Mason &amp; Dixon</i>. More recently, Pynchon provided <a href="/wiki/Fax.html" title="Fax">faxed</a> answers to questions submitted by author <a  class="new" title="David Hajdu">David Hajdu</a> and permitted excerpts from his personal correspondence to be quoted in Hajdu's 2001 book, <i>Positively 4th Street: The Lives and Times of Joan Baez, Bob Dylan, Mimi Baez Fariña and Richard Fariña</i> (<a  title="">Warner 2001</a>).</p>
<p>Pynchon's attempt to maintain his personal <a href="/wiki/Privacy.html" title="Privacy">privacy</a> and have his work speak for itself has resulted in a number of outlandish rumors and hoaxes over the years. Indeed, claims that Pynchon was the <a href="/wiki/Theodore_Kaczynski.html" title="Theodore Kaczynski">Unabomber</a> or a sympathizer with the Waco <a href="/wiki/Branch_Davidians.html" title="Branch Davidians">Branch Davidians</a> after the 1993 siege were upstaged in the mid-1990s by the invention of an elaborate rumor insinuating that Pynchon and one "<a href="/wiki/Wanda_Tinasky.html" title="Wanda Tinasky">Wanda Tinasky</a>" were the same person. A spate of letters authored under that name had appeared in the late 1980s in the <i><a href="/wiki/Anderson_Valley_Advertiser.html" title="Anderson Valley Advertiser">Anderson Valley Advertiser</a></i> in <a href="/wiki/Anderson_Valley.html" title="Anderson Valley">Anderson Valley</a>, <a href="/wiki/California.html" title="California">California</a>. The style and content of those letters were said to resemble Pynchon's, and Pynchon's <i>Vineland</i>, published in 1990, also takes place in northern California, so it was suggested that Pynchon may have been in the area at that time, conducting research. A collection of the Tinasky letters was eventually published as a paperback book in 1996; however, Pynchon himself denied having written the letters, and no direct attribution of the letters to Pynchon was ever made. "Literary detective" <a href="/wiki/Donald_Foster.html" title="Donald Foster">Donald Foster</a> subsequently showed that the <i>Letters</i> were in fact written by an obscure <a href="/wiki/Beat_generation.html" title="Beat generation">Beat</a> writer called Tom Hawkins, who had murdered his wife and then committed suicide in 1988. Foster's evidence was conclusive, including finding the typewriter on which the "Tinasky" letters had been written (<a  title="">Foster 2000</a>).</p>
<p>An article purporting to be the transcript of an <a href="/wiki/Interview.html" title="Interview">interview</a> with Pynchon in the wake of the <a href="/wiki/September_11_attacks.html" title="September 11 attacks">September 11 attacks</a> on the U.S. appeared in the December 2001 issue of <i><a href="/wiki/Playboy_%28magazine%29.html" title="Playboy (magazine)">Playboy Japan</a>.</i> This transcript has not circulated widely in English translation.</p>

Pynchon depicted in <i><a href="/wiki/The_Simpsons.html" title="The Simpsons">The Simpsons</a></i> episode "Diatribe of a Mad Housewife". His <i>Simpsons</i> appearances are the only times that Pynchon's voice has been broadcast in the media.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Responding ironically to the image which has been manufactured in the media over the years, during 2004, Pynchon made two cameo appearances on the animated television series <i><a href="/wiki/The_Simpsons.html" title="The Simpsons">The Simpsons</a></i>. The first occurs in the episode "<a href="/wiki/Diatribe_of_a_Mad_Housewife.html" title="Diatribe of a Mad Housewife">Diatribe of a Mad Housewife</a>", in which <a href="/wiki/Marge_Simpson.html" title="Marge Simpson">Marge Simpson</a> becomes a novelist. He plays himself, with a paper bag over his head, and provides a blurb for the back cover of Marge's book, speaking in a broad Long Island accent: "Here's your quote: Thomas Pynchon loved this book, almost as much as he loves cameras!" He then starts yelling at passing cars: "Hey, over here, have your picture taken with a reclusive author! Today only, we'll throw in a free autograph! But, wait! There's more!" The second appearance occurs in "<a href="/wiki/All%27s_Fair_in_Oven_War.html" title="All's Fair in Oven War">All's Fair in Oven War</a>," which was the sixteenth-season premiere. In this appearance, Pynchon's dialogue consists entirely of <a href="/wiki/Pun.html" title="Pun">puns</a> on his novel titles ("These wings are 'V'-licious! I'll put this recipe in 'The Gravity's Rainbow Cookbook', right next to 'The Frying of <a href="/wiki/Latke.html" title="Latke">Latke</a> 49'.").</p>
<p>In July of 2006, <a href="/wiki/Amazon.com.html" title="Amazon.com">Amazon.com</a> created a page showing an upcoming 992-page, untitled, Thomas Pynchon novel. A description of the soon-to-be published novel appeared on Amazon purporting to be written by Pynchon himself. According to <a href="/wiki/Slate.com.html" title="Slate.com">Slate.com</a>'s television critic, Troy Patterson, "it purported quite well indeed and also rather charmingly, promising an archetypal Pynchonian buffet of settings, characters, and old tricks." It then vanished. In a follow-up article, Patterson announced that the title of the upcoming Pynchon novel would be <i>Against the Day</i>, and that the description was indeed written by Pynchon, but was released prematurely. <a href="/wiki/Blog.html" title="Blog">Blog</a> discussions, momentarily fuelled by Patterson's misquotation of his sole source in his original article, speculated about whether the sequence of events was a <a href="/wiki/Hoax.html" title="Hoax">hoax</a>, a gag, a stunt, a mistake, or part of a covert <a href="/wiki/Marketing.html" title="Marketing">marketing</a> strategy condoned by, or originating with, the author himself, one which had succeeded in attracting widespread media attention and substantial pre-publication sales. Some observers contemplated whether this apparent <a href="/wiki/Viral_marketing.html" title="Viral marketing">viral advertising</a> campaign might mirror themes in the forthcoming novel, echoing Patterson's own comment that "the new book with the rather coyly withheld title will enter an <a href="/wiki/Internet.html" title="Internet">Internet Age</a> in bloom, which is just too perfect" (<a  title="">Patterson 2006a</a>).</p>
