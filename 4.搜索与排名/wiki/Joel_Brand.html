<p><b>Joel Brand</b> (1907–July 13, 1964) was a <a href="/wiki/Hungary.html" title="Hungary">Hungarian</a> <a href="/wiki/Jew.html" title="Jew">Jew</a> who played a prominent role in trying to save the <a href="/wiki/History_of_the_Jews_in_Hungary.html" title="History of the Jews in Hungary">Hungarian Jewish community</a> during the <a href="/wiki/Holocaust.html" title="Holocaust">Holocaust</a> from deportation to the <a href="/wiki/Nazi_Germany.html" title="Nazi Germany">German</a> <a href="/wiki/Nazi_extermination_camp.html" title="Nazi extermination camp">death camp</a> at <a href="/wiki/Auschwitz_concentration_camp.html" title="Auschwitz concentration camp">Auschwitz</a>.</p>
<p>Described by historian <a href="/wiki/Yehuda_Bauer.html" title="Yehuda Bauer">Yehuda Bauer</a> as a brave adventurer who felt at home in "underground conspiracies and card-playing circles," <sup id="_ref-Bauer194_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[1]</a></sup> Brand teamed up with fellow Zionists in Hungary, in or around 1942, to form the <a href="/wiki/Aid_and_Rescue_Committee.html" title="Aid and Rescue Committee">Aid and Rescue Committee</a>, a small group dedicated to helping Jewish refugees in Nazi-occupied <a href="/wiki/Europe.html" title="Europe">Europe</a> escape to the relative safety of Hungary, before the German invasion of that country in March 1944.</p>
<p>Shortly after the invasion, Brand was asked by <a href="/wiki/Schutzstaffel.html" title="Schutzstaffel">SS</a> officer <a href="/wiki/Adolf_Eichmann.html" title="Adolf Eichmann">Adolf Eichmann</a> to help broker a deal between the SS and the <a href="/wiki/United_States.html" title="United States">United States</a> or <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom.html" title="United Kingdom">Britain</a>. Eichmann told Brand that he was prepared to release up to one million Hungarian Jews, <sup id="_ref-Hilberg1219_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[2]</a></sup> <sup id="_ref-Hecht220_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[3]</a></sup> who were otherwise destined for Auschwitz, if the Western Allies would supply Germany with 10,000 trucks, and large quantities of soap, tea, and coffee. The proposed deal, later described by <i><a href="/wiki/The_Times.html" title="The Times">The Times</a></i> as one of the "most loathsome" stories of the war, became known as the "blood for goods," <sup id="_ref-Hilberg1219_1" class="reference"><a  title="">[2]</a></sup> "blood for trucks," <sup id="_ref-jhs_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[4]</a></sup> or "Blood and Cargo" <sup id="_ref-Hecht221_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[5]</a></sup> proposal. It came to nothing and so historians can only speculate as to whether Eichmann's offer was genuine. There are theories that it was a trick intended to pacify the Jewish community to prevent an uprising, so that they would quietly board the trains to Auschwitz thinking they were being resettled, or that it was a cover for high-ranking SS officials, probably including <a href="/wiki/Heinrich_Himmler.html" title="Heinrich Himmler">Heinrich Himmler</a>, to make contact with the U.S and Britain to negotiate a secret peace deal that did not involve the <a href="/wiki/Soviet_Union.html" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a>, and possibly one that also excluded <a href="/wiki/Adolf_Hitler.html" title="Adolf Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a>. <sup id="_ref-Bauer168_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>Whatever its purpose, the deal was thwarted by a suspicious British government and the <a href="/wiki/Jewish_Agency_for_Israel.html" title="Jewish Agency for Israel">Jewish Agency</a>, to Brand's great distress. Their reasons for scuppering the proposal, and the consequences of doing so, have been the subject of bitter debate ever since, particularly among Hungarian Holocaust survivors, some of whom have said that it was an unforgivable <a href="/wiki/Betrayal.html" title="Betrayal">betrayal</a>. <sup id="_ref-Vrba_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[7]</a></sup> Brand himself said: "Rightly or wrongly, for better or for worse, I have cursed Jewry's official leaders ever since. All these things shall haunt me until my dying day. It is much more than a man can bear." <sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a  title="">[8]</a></sup></p>

<p>Brand was born in <a href="/wiki/N%C4%83s%C4%83ud.html" title="Năsăud">Năsăud</a>, <a href="/wiki/Transylvania.html" title="Transylvania">Transylvania</a>, now <a href="/wiki/Romania.html" title="Romania">Romania</a>, moving in 1910 with his family to <a href="/wiki/Erfurt.html" title="Erfurt">Erfurt</a> in <a href="/wiki/Germany.html" title="Germany">Germany</a>, where he was raised and educated. He became a <a href="/wiki/Communism.html" title="Communism">communist</a> and worked for the <a href="/wiki/Comintern.html" title="Comintern">Comintern</a> as a sailor and odd-job man, spending time in the <a href="/wiki/Philippines.html" title="Philippines">Philippines</a>, <a href="/wiki/Japan.html" title="Japan">Japan</a>, <a href="/wiki/China.html" title="China">China</a>, and <a href="/wiki/South_America.html" title="South America">South America</a> before returning to Germany, where he became a middle-ranking communist functionary. His position led to his arrest after the <a href="/wiki/Reichstag_fire.html" title="Reichstag fire">Reichstag fire</a> in 1933, when the Nazis began rounding up socialists and communists. <sup id="_ref-Zahn_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[9]</a></sup> When he was released in 1934, he left Germany and settled in <a href="/wiki/Budapest.html" title="Budapest">Budapest</a>, <a href="/wiki/Hungary.html" title="Hungary">Hungary</a>, where he got a job with the Budapest Telephone Company and became a <a href="/wiki/Zionism.html" title="Zionism">Zionist</a>, joining the <a href="/wiki/Labor_%28Israel%29.html" title="Labor (Israel)">Mapai</a> (Israel Labour Party) youth movement. <sup id="_ref-Bauer152_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 1935, he married another member of the Zionist movement in Budapest, Hansi Hartmann, who owned a factory that produced gloves, socks, and sweaters. <sup id="_ref-Hansi_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[11]</a></sup> In July 1941, Hansi's sister <sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a  title="">[12]</a></sup> got caught up in the so-called <a href="/wiki/Kamianets-Podilskyi.html" title="Kamianets-Podilskyi">Kamenets Podolskiy</a> deportations, when the Hungarian government decided to deport between 18,000 <sup id="_ref-Bauer148_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[13]</a></sup> and 25,000 <sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a  title="">[14]</a></sup> Jews to German-occupied <a href="/wiki/Ukraine.html" title="Ukraine">Ukraine</a>, because they could not prove they had Hungarian citizenship. Between 14,000 and 16,000 <sup id="_ref-Bauer148_1" class="reference"><a  title="">[13]</a></sup> of the deportees were gunned down by the <a href="/wiki/Schutzstaffel.html" title="Schutzstaffel">SS</a> on August 27 and 28, 1941, but Brand paid Josezf Krem, a Hungarian espionage agent, to get Hansi's sister back safely. That incident was the beginning of Brand's involvement in smuggling Jewish refugees from <a href="/wiki/Poland.html" title="Poland">Poland</a> and <a href="/wiki/Slovakia.html" title="Slovakia">Slovakia</a> to the relative safety of Hungary.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Yehuda_Bauer.html" title="Yehuda Bauer">Yehuda Bauer</a>, Professor of Holocaust Studies at the <a href="/wiki/Hebrew_University_of_Jerusalem.html" title="Hebrew University of Jerusalem">Hebrew University of Jerusalem</a>, writes of Brand that he was a man who enjoyed easy living and adventure, who felt at home in cafés and bars, in "underground conspiracies and card-playing circles," and whose truthfulness was "not always impeccable," but he was also a brave and intelligent operator who genuinely wanted to help Jews escape death. <sup id="_ref-Bauer194_1" class="reference"><a  title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>As the situation for Jewish communities in <a href="/wiki/Europe.html" title="Europe">Europe</a> worsened, Brand teamed up in his rescue activities with <a href="/wiki/Rudolf_Kastner.html" title="Rudolf Kastner">Rudolf Kastner</a>, a Zionist lawyer and journalist from <a href="/wiki/Cluj_County.html" title="Cluj County">Cluj</a>, and Samuel Springmann, a <a href="/wiki/History_of_the_Jews_in_Poland.html" title="History of the Jews in Poland">Polish Jew</a> and center-left Zionist who owned a jewellery store, and who began to function as the treasurer of their fledgling rescue committee.</p>
<p>In early 1943, the group was joined by Otto Komoly, a Budapest engineer, reserve officer, war veteran, and member of the Liberal Zionist Party, who was known and highly respected among the Jewish community in Budapest. Komoly's membership gave the group the credibility it needed. He became their chairman, <sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a  title="">[15]</a></sup> and with that, the <i>Va'adat Ezrah Vehatzalah</i> (<i>Vaada</i>) — the <a href="/wiki/Aid_and_Rescue_Committee.html" title="Aid and Rescue Committee">Aid and Rescue Committee</a> — was born, <sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a  title="">[16]</a></sup> consisting of Komoly, Kastner, Joel and Hansi Brand, Moshe Krausz and Eugen Frankl (both <a href="/wiki/Orthodox_Jew.html" title="Orthodox Jew">Orthodox Jews</a> and Zionists), and Ernst Szilagyi from the left-wing <i><a href="/wiki/Hashomer_Hatzair.html" title="Hashomer Hatzair">Hashomer Hatzair</a></i>. <sup id="_ref-Bauer153_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[17]</a></sup> Operating outside the structure of the formal Jewish institutions, the committee embodied a "daring and activist ethos," according to historian <a href="/wiki/Ronald_W._Zweig.html" title="Ronald W.

Brand told his story as a prosecution witness at the trial of <a href="/wiki/Adolf_Eichmann.html" title="Adolf Eichmann">Adolf Eichmann</a> in <a href="/wiki/Jerusalem.html" title="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> in 1961</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>On Sunday, <a href="/wiki/March_19.html" title="March 19">March 19</a>, <a href="/wiki/1944.html" title="1944">1944</a>, the <a href="/wiki/History_of_Hungary#World_War_II.html" title="History of Hungary">Germans invaded Hungary</a> with relatively weak forces which met no resistance. Brand was abducted and hidden in a safehouse by Josef Winninger, a courier for the German <i><a href="/wiki/Abwehr.html" title="Abwehr">Abwehr</a></i> (military intelligence), who had been taking money from Brand in exchange for information about Jewish refugees, and whom Brand paid between $8,000 and $20,000 for a place to hide. <sup id="_ref-Bauer154_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[19]</a></sup></p>
<p>According to testimony Brand gave in 1954 to the District Court in <a href="/wiki/Jerusalem.html" title="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> during a libel case <sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a  title="">[20]</a></sup> — and which he repeated during the trial of <a href="/wiki/Adolf_Eichmann.html" title="Adolf Eichmann">Adolf Eichmann</a> in Jerusalem in 1961 — on April 16 or 25, 1944, <sup id="_ref-Bauer163_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[21]</a></sup> he was told by one of the German agents in <a href="/wiki/Budapest.html" title="Budapest">Budapest</a>, probably Winninger, that he was to wait at a certain street corner at an appointed time, and would be taken to meet Eichmann. <sup id="_ref-Hecht219_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[22]</a></sup></p>
<p>Brand was taken to a luxury hotel that Eichmann was using as his headquarters. He told the court in <a href="/wiki/German_language.html" title="German language">German</a> that "[t]he words which then passed between us have imprinted themselves on my memory till I die." <sup id="_ref-Hecht219_1" class="reference"><a  title="">[22]</a></sup> Brand later told the court during Eichmann's trial that Untersturmbannführer <a href="/wiki/Kurt_Becher.html" title="Kurt Becher">Kurt A. Becher</a>, an <a href="/wiki/Schutzstaffel.html" title="Schutzstaffel">SS</a> officer and emissary of <a href="/wiki/Heinrich_Himmler.html" title="Heinrich Himmler">Heinrich Himmler</a>, <sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a  title="">[23]</a></sup> was standing behind Eichmann during the meeting. <sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a  title="">[24]</a></sup></p>
<p>If this is correct, it means the meeting was of extraordinary importance, according to historian <a href="/wiki/Yehuda_Bauer.html" title="Yehuda Bauer">Yehuda Bauer</a>, because Brand also testified that Gerhard Clages, the chief of Himmler's Security Service in Budapest, and a rival of Eichmann's, was present at a later meeting, again with Becher and Eichmann. This means that Himmler had involved three of his men of the same rank to negotiate with Brand: Eichmann, whose job it was to kill Jews; Clages, whose task for Himmler was to reach out to forge a positive relationship with the West, because Germany knew it was losing the war; and Becher, who Bauer writes was meant to ensure the SS did not lose any money or goods. <sup id="_ref-Bauer165_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[25]</a></sup></p>
<p>Brand said that Eichmann asked him "Do you know who I am?" and continued:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have carried out the <i>Aktionen</i> in <a href="/wiki/Nazi_Germany.html" title="Nazi Germany">the Reich</a> — in <a href="/wiki/History_of_Poland_%281939%E2%80%931945%29.html" title="History of Poland (1939–1945)">Poland</a> — in <a href="/wiki/German_occupation_of_Czechoslovakia.html" title="German occupation of Czechoslovakia">Czechoslovakia</a>. Now it is Hungary's turn. I let you come here to talk business with you. Before that I investigated you — and your people. Those from the <a href="/wiki/American_Jewish_Joint_Distribution_Committee.html" title="American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee">Joint</a> and those from the <a href="/wiki/Jewish_Agency.html" title="Jewish Agency">Agency</a>. And I have come to the conclusion that you still have resources. So I am ready to sell you — a million Jews. All of them I wouldn't sell you. That much money and goods you don't have. But a million — that will go. Goods for blood — blood for goods. You can gather up this million in countries which still have Jews. You can take it from Hungary. From Poland. From Austria. From Theresienstadt. From Auschwitz. From wherever you want. What do you want to save. Virile men? Grown women? Old people? Children? Sit down — and talk. <sup id="_ref-Hilberg1219_2" class="reference"><a  title="">[2]</a></sup> <sup id="_ref-Hecht220_1" class="reference"><a  title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Brand told Eichmann that he was not empowered to make that decision and asked where they were supposed to obtain the cargo from, given that the Germans had confiscated Jewish property. Eichmann suggested he go abroad and negotiate directly with <a href="/wiki/Allies_of_World_War_II.html" title="Allies of World War II">the Allies</a>. <sup id="_ref-Hilberg1219_3" class="reference"><a  title="">[2]</a></sup> Eichmann told him they wanted any kind of cargo, but particularly trucks. "Ten thousand trucks are worth a million Jews to me," Brand quoted him as saying. <sup id="_ref-Hecht220_2" class="reference"><a  title="">[3]</a></sup> Eichmann also asked for one thousand tons of tea and coffee, and soap. According to Bauer, Hermann Krumey, an assistant of Eichmann's, also asked for machine tools, leather and other goods, but the proposal soon settled into 10,000 trucks and various consumer items. <sup id="_ref-Bauer163_1" class="reference"><a  title="">[21]</a></sup> Figures that were mentioned according to later testimony from Rudolf Kastner were 200 tons of tea, 200 tons of coffee, 2,000,000 cases of soap, 10,000 trucks for the <a href="/wiki/Waffen-SS.html" title="Waffen-SS">Waffen-SS</a> to be used on the eastern front, and unspecified quantities of <a href="/wiki/Tungsten.html" title="Tungsten">tungsten</a> and other war materials. <sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a  title="">[26]</a></sup></p>
<p>Eichmann said he was willing to offer one thousand Jews in advance, and on receiving the first payment, a further ten per cent. He told Brand: "Pick them anywhere you want. Hungary, <a href="/wiki/Auschwitz_concentration_camp.html" title="Auschwitz concentration camp">Auschwitz</a>, <a href="/wiki/Slovakia.html" title="Slovakia">Slovakia</a> — anywhere you want and anyone you want." <sup id="_ref-Hecht220_3" class="reference"><a  title="">[3]</a></sup> Brand was asked where he wanted to go to make the offer to the Jews and the Allies. He chose <a href="/wiki/Istanbul.html" title="Istanbul">Istanbul</a>. <sup id="_ref-Bauer163_2" class="reference"><a  title="">[21]</a></sup> "The Jews, in the meantime, would be sent to Auschwitz to be gassed until such time as a favorable reply was received," according to historian <a href="/wiki/Raul_Hilberg.html" title="Raul Hilberg">Raul Hilberg</a>. <sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a  title="">[27]</a></sup></p>
<p>Brand asked what assurance Eichmann could offer the Allies that the Jews really would be released. Eichmann responded:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You think we are all crooks. You hold <i>us</i> for what <i>you</i> are. Now I am going to prove to you that I trust you more than you trust me. When you come back from Istanbul and tell me that the offer has been accepted, I will dissolve Auschwitz and move 10 percent of the promised million to the border. You take over the 100,000 Jews and deliver for them afterwards one thousand trucks. And then the deal with proceed step by step. For every hundred thousand Jews, a thousand trucks. You are getting away cheap.<sup id="_ref-Hilberg1220_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[28]</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Brand told the court: "On leaving the building, I felt like a stark madman." <sup id="_ref-Hecht220_4" class="reference"><a  title="">[3]</a></sup> It was the first time anyone from the <a href="/wiki/Aid_and_Rescue_Committee.html" title="Aid and Rescue Committee">Aid and Rescue Committee</a> had met Eichmann. Brand testified: "What were we to do with this monster's offer? ... I had gotten to know the Germans and their cruel lies exceedingly well. But the thought of 100,000 Jews 'in advance' tortured my mind and gave me no respite. I had no right to think of anything but this advance payment." <sup id="_ref-Hecht221_1" class="reference"><a  title="">[5]</a></sup> He believed that if he could only return from Istanbul with a promise, at least those 100,000 lives might be saved. <sup id="_ref-Hilberg1220_1" class="reference"><a  title="">[28]</a></sup></p>
<p>He met with Eichmann again, the last meeting taking place on <a href="/wiki/May_14.html" title="May 14">May 14</a>, <a href="/wiki/1944.html" title="1944">1944</a>. Eichmann told him the deportations to Auschwitz were about to begin at a rate of 12,000 <sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a  title="">[29]</a></sup> Jews a day, but that they would not be exterminated while negotiations were ongoing. According to Brand's testimony, Gerhard Clages, chief of Himmler's Security Service in Budapest, and Eichmann's rival, <sup id="_ref-Bauer164_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[30]</a></sup> was present, and handed Brand $50,000 and SFR 270,000. Brand told U.S. emissary Ira Hirschmann during an interview on <a href="/wiki/June_22.html" title="June 22">June 22</a>, <a href="/wiki/1944.html" title="1944">1944</a> that Eichmann had offered to blow up Auschwitz — "<i>dann sprenge ich Auschwitz in die Luft</i>" <sup id="_ref-Hilberg1220_2" class="reference"><a  title="">[28]</a></sup> — and free the first "ten, twenty, fifty thousand Jews" as soon as he received word from Istanbul that an agreement had been reached in principle. <sup id="_ref-Bauer164_1" class="reference"><a  title="">[30]</a></sup> <sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a  title="">[31]</a></sup></p>
<p>Eichmann told Brand he was free to travel but that he should return to Budapest soon. According to Yehuda Bauer, Brand was not consistent in his testimony regarding how long Eichmann had given him, but said at various points that it was within one or two weeks, within two or three weeks, and that he could "take [his] time." <sup id="_ref-Bauer165_1" class="reference"><a  title="">[25]</a></sup> A report prepared by Kastner and entered as evidence during Eichman's trial states that Eichmann expected Brand to return within two weeks. <sup id="_ref-Eichmann2_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[32]</a></sup> <sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a  title="">[33]</a></sup></p>
<p>Hansi Brand testified during Eichmann's trial that she and her husband met with Eichmann on the day before Joel left for Istanbul, and that she was given to understand that she and her children would effectively be held hostage in Budapest until Joel returned. "It was very obvious, although it was not actually said in so many words, 'you will remain behind as hostages.' I cannot recall that precisely. But I was told that I was not allowed to leave Budapest with the children, and that I had to report every day. By then we had had so much experience with our illegal work that it was not necessary to give any further explanations. What it means is obvious, if someone is told that he may not leave Budapest, and I have to report every day." <sup id="_ref-Hansi_1" class="reference"><a  title="">[11]</a></sup></p>

<p>The day after his last meeting with Eichmann, Brand secured "full powers" from the <i>Zentralrat der Ungarischen Juden</i> (the main Hungarian <a href="/wiki/Judenrat.html" title="Judenrat">Jewish council</a>) <sup id="_ref-Hilberg1220_3" class="reference"><a  title="">[28]</a></sup> and was told he had a traveling companion, Bandi Grosz, <sup id="_ref-Hilberg1220_4" class="reference"><a  title="">[28]</a></sup> <sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a  title="">[34]</a></sup> a Hungarian Jew alleged by various sources to have been a spy for the Germans, Hungarians, British, and Americans, <sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a  title="">[35]</a></sup> <sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a  title="">[36]</a></sup> who was traveling under cover of being the director of a Hungarian transport company engaged in talks with the <a href="/wiki/Turkey.html" title="Turkey">Turkish</a> state transport corporation. <sup id="_ref-Hilberg1221_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[37]</a></sup></p>
<p>The men left <a href="/wiki/Budapest.html" title="Budapest">Budapest</a> on <a href="/wiki/May_17.html" title="May 17">May 17</a>, <a href="/wiki/1944.html" title="1944">1944</a> and were driven by the SS to <a href="/wiki/Vienna.html" title="Vienna">Vienna</a>, where they stayed the night in a hotel reserved for SS personnel. In fact, Brand's trip is now believed by many historians to have been a cover for Grosz's mission. Grosz, who was low level enough to provide plausible deniability for the Germans in case anything went wrong, later testified that he had been told by Clages, on behalf of <a href="/wiki/Heinrich_Himmler.html" title="Heinrich Himmler">Himmler</a>, to arrange a meeting in a neutral country between two or three senior German security officers and two or three American officers of equal rank, or British officers as a last resort, in order to negotiate a separate peace between the German <i><a href="/wiki/Sicherheitsdienst.html" title="Sicherheitsdienst">Sicherheitsdienst</a></i> (SD) (part of the SS) and the Allies. <sup id="_ref-Bauer166_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[38]</a></sup></p>
<p>Slovak historian <a href="/wiki/Miroslav_Karny.html" title="Miroslav Karny">Miroslav Karny</a> writes that: "From British documents published in the seventies as well as from the memoirs of Joel Brand, it is obvious that Grosz carried not only an offer that Hungary would change over to the side of the Allies on condition the <a href="/wiki/Soviet_Union.html" title="Soviet Union">Soviet</a> offensive stopped at the Hungarian border, but in particular a proposal from the chief of Himmler's Security Service in Budapest, Gerhard Clages, that two or three higher German intelligence officers should meet with their American counterparts to discuss a separate peace. In case of failure, Grosz was to organize a meeting with British officers via officials of the Jewish Agency in Istanbul. Grosz stressed to Brand that the intelligence service mission was the main thing and Brand's mission was intended just as a cover. Referring to his talks with Clages, Grosz explained: 'The Nazis know that they have lost the war. They know that peace cannot be reached with Hitler. Himmler wants to use all possible contacts to get down to negotiations with the Allies.' He added: 'Your Jewish affair was only an auxiliary question'." <sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a  title="">[39]</a></sup></p>

<h2>Meeting with the Jewish Agency</h2>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/Vienna.html" title="Vienna">Vienna</a>, Brand was given a German passport in the name of Eugen Band. Brand cabled ahead to the <a href="/wiki/Jewish_Agency_for_Israel.html" title="Jewish Agency for Israel">Jewish Agency</a> in <a href="/wiki/Istanbul.html" title="Istanbul">Istanbul</a> (then <a href="/wiki/Constantinople.html" title="Constantinople">Constantinople</a>) to say he was about to arrive, then flew first to <a href="/wiki/Sofia.html" title="Sofia">Sofia</a>, then on to Istanbul, by German diplomatic plane, arriving on May 19. He had been told by the Jewish Agency by return cable that "Chaim" would be in Istanbul to meet him. Excited by his mission, and believing that others would understand its importance, he believed "Chaim" referred to <a href="/wiki/Chaim_Weizmann.html" title="Chaim Weizmann">Chaim Weizmann</a>, then president of the <a href="/wiki/World_Zionist_Organization.html" title="World Zionist Organization">World Zionist Organization</a> who later became the first president of Israel, but in fact they meant Chaim Barlas, head of the Istanbul group of <a href="/wiki/Zionism.html" title="Zionism">Zionist</a> emissaries. <sup id="_ref-Bauer172_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[40]</a></sup></p>
<p>Brand was further confused when, arriving in Istanbul, he found that, not only was no one waiting to meet him at the airport and no entry visa had been arranged, <sup id="_ref-Hecht222_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[41]</a></sup> but that he was threatened with arrest and deportation, which he later took as the first sign of what he came to see as his betrayal by the Jewish Agency. In fact, when he landed, Chaim Barlas was at that very moment driving around the city trying to obtain Brand's visa. <sup id="_ref-Hilberg1221_1" class="reference"><a  title="">[37]</a></sup></p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Yehuda_Bauer.html" title="Yehuda Bauer">Yehuda Bauer</a> argues that Brand, then and later, never understood the actual powerlessness of the Jewish Agency. The fact that his passport was in the name of Eugen Band, and not Joel Brand, would in itself have been enough to cause the confusion. <sup id="_ref-Bauer172_1" class="reference"><a  title="">[40]</a></sup> The visa situation was eventually sorted out by Bandi Grosz, who had intelligence connections in Istanbul and who made a few calls, and the men were taken to a hotel, where the Jewish Agency emissaries were waiting. <sup id="_ref-Hilberg1221_2" class="reference"><a  title="">[37]</a></sup></p>

</div>
<p><a href="/wiki/Raul_Hilberg.html" title="Raul Hilberg">Raul Hilberg</a> writes that Brand was angry and excited. He quotes Brand as saying: "Comrades, do you realize what is involved? ... We have to negotiate ... With whom can I negotiate? Do you have the power to make agreements ... Twelve thousand people are hauled away every day ... that is five hundred an hour ... Do they have to die because no one from the Executive is here? I want to telegraph tomorrow that I have secured agreement ... Do you know what is involved, comrades?" <sup id="_ref-Hilberg1221_3" class="reference"><a  title="">[37]</a></sup></p>
<p>For the Jewish Agency, matters were not so simple, Hilberg writes. They could not be sure that their telegrams to <a href="/wiki/Jerusalem.html" title="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> would not be intercepted and changed, or held up. No one had the influence to obtain a plane. No one from the War Refugee Board was available. The American Ambassador was in <a href="/wiki/Ankara.html" title="Ankara">Ankara</a> and no plane seat could be obtained for a trip there. <sup id="_ref-Hilberg1221_4" class="reference"><a  title="">[37]</a></sup></p>
<p>They told Brand that <a href="/wiki/Moshe_Sharett.html" title="Moshe Sharett">Moshe Sharett</a>, head of the Jewish Agency's political department, and the Zionist movement's chief ambassador and negotiator with the British in the <a href="/wiki/British_Mandate_of_Palestine.html" title="British Mandate of Palestine">British Mandate of Palestine</a> (and later the second prime minister of Israel), would be arriving in Istanbul to meet him, which gave Brand hope that the situation was being taken seriously. <sup id="_ref-Hilberg1221_5" class="reference"><a  title="">[37]</a></sup> He passed them an accurate plan of the Auschwitz complex (possibly the <a href="/wiki/Rudolf_Vrba.html" title="Rudolf Vrba">Vrba-Weztler report</a>) and demanded that the gas chambers and railways lines be bombed. He later said that he got the impression that the Agency officials were not quite taking it all in. "They did not, as we did in Budapest, look daily at death." <sup id="_ref-Hilberg1221_6" class="reference"><a  title="">[37]</a></sup></p>
<p>In the meantime, the Agency gave Brand a piece of paper purporting to be a written agreement that it would accept Eichmann's offer in principle. The document promised the Germans $4,000 for each 1,000 Jewish emigrants to Palestine and SFR one million for each 1,000 Jewish emigrants to <a href="/wiki/Spain.html" title="Spain">Spain</a>. In return for allowing the Allies to supply goods to the Jews in the concentration camps, the Germans would receive equivalent supplies for themselves. <sup id="_ref-Bauer176_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[42]</a></sup> Brand took the document to deliver to Eichmann, hoping it might be enough to halt the deportations, at least temporarily. <sup id="_ref-Hecht224_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[43]</a></sup></p>

<h2>Arrested by British intelligence</h2>
<p>After a few days in <a href="/wiki/Istanbul.html" title="Istanbul">Istanbul</a>, it became clear that Sharett was not going to arrive, and Brand was told he had been refused a visa and that the British were actively preventing him from traveling to Turkey. Brand was asked instead to travel to <a href="/wiki/Aleppo.html" title="Aleppo">Aleppo</a> on the Syrian-Turkish border to meet Sharett there. <sup id="_ref-Hecht222_1" class="reference"><a  title="">[41]</a></sup> He was reluctant to do this because the area was under British control and he was afraid that the British would interfere with his travel plans and would want to question him. However, he was persuaded to go, and left by train, accompanied by two members of the Jewish Agency.</p>
<p>On the train, Brand became even more nervous after being approached by men who said they were agents of <a href="/wiki/Zeev_Jabotinsky.html" title="Zeev Jabotinsky">Zeev Jabotinsky</a>'s <a href="/wiki/Hatzohar.html" title="Hatzohar">Alliance of Zionists-Revisionists Party</a> and the <a href="/wiki/World_Agudath_Israel.html" title="World Agudath Israel">World Agudath Israel</a> <a href="/wiki/Orthodox_Judaism.html" title="Orthodox Judaism">Orthodox</a> religious party. They told him that the British were going to arrest him in Aleppo. <sup id="_ref-Hecht225_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[44]</a></sup> "<i>Die Engländer sind in dieser Frage nicht unsere Verbündeten</i>", they told him. ("The British are not our allies in this matter.") If he continued on his journey, he would not be allowed to return, they said. <sup id="_ref-Hilberg1222_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[45]</a></sup></p>
<p>Brand told the court that he was terrified when he heard this, because not returning to Budapest within the timeframe specified by Eichmann meant "the failure of my mission and the extermination of my family and a million other Jews in Hungary." <sup id="_ref-Hecht225_1" class="reference"><a  title="">[44]</a></sup> However, he was assured by one of his traveling companions from the Jewish Agency that nothing was going to happen to him in Aleppo, and he wanted to believe this: "I could not believe that <a href="/wiki/England.html" title="England">England</a> — this land which alone fought on while all other countries of Europe surrendered to despotism — that this England which we had admired as the inflexible fighter for freedom wanted simply to sacrifice us, the poorest and weakest of all the oppressed." <sup id="_ref-Hilberg1222_1" class="reference"><a  title="">[45]</a></sup></p>

</div>
</div>
<p>After arriving in <a href="/wiki/Ankara.html" title="Ankara">Ankara</a>, the men continued by train to Aleppo. According to <a href="/wiki/Ben_Hecht.html" title="Ben Hecht">Ben Hecht</a>, just before arriving the Jewish Agency official who had assured Brand he would not be arrested told him that, should he indeed be picked up by the British, he was not to speak to them without a member of the Jewish Agency being present. <sup id="_ref-Hecht225_2" class="reference"><a  title="">[44]</a></sup> Hecht argues that this was the ultimate betrayal. Not only had the Agency effectively handed Brand over to the British, Hecht says, but they then acted to ensure he remained silent unless the Agency itself gave him permission to speak. <sup id="_ref-Hecht225_3" class="reference"><a  title="">[44]</a></sup></p>
<p>As soon as he arrived in Aleppo on <a href="/wiki/June_7.html" title="June 7">June 7</a>, <a href="/wiki/1944.html" title="1944">1944</a>, Brand was arrested by two men in plain clothes who blocked his way then pushed him into a Jeep waiting with its engine running. <sup id="_ref-Hilberg1222_2" class="reference"><a  title="">[45]</a></sup> He discovered later they were British intelligence. <sup id="_ref-Hecht225_4" class="reference"><a  title="">[44]</a></sup></p>
<p>According to <a href="/wiki/Raul_Hilberg.html" title="Raul Hilberg">Raul Hilberg</a>, details of Brand's business in Istanbul had been passed to London and Washington. <sup id="_ref-Hilberg1222_3" class="reference"><a  title="">[45]</a></sup> The Cabinet Committee on Refugees in London, which included <a href="/wiki/Secretary_of_State_for_Foreign_and_Commonwealth_Affairs.html" title="Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs">British Foreign Secretary</a> (later <a href="/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom.html" title="Prime Minister of the United Kingdom">Prime Minister</a>) <a href="/wiki/Anthony_Eden.html" title="Anthony Eden">Anthony Eden</a> and <a href="/wiki/Secretary_of_State_for_the_Colonies.html" title="Secretary of State for the Colonies">Colonial Secretary</a> <a href="/wiki/Oliver_Stanley.html" title="Oliver Stanley">Oliver Stanley</a>, considered the bloods-for-truck proposal and decided against pursuing it. If the suggestion had indeed come from the SS, it was a clear case of <a href="/wiki/Blackmail.html" title="Blackmail">blackmail</a>, and in any event, supplying extra trucks would simply strengthen the enemy's hand, writes Hilberg. In addition, to leave the selection of refugees to be saved up to the Nazis, without considering the interests of Allied prisoners, would leave the British government opened to domestic criticism. <sup id="_ref-Hilberg1223_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[47]</a></sup></p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Yehuda_Bauer.html" title="Yehuda Bauer">Yehuda Bauer</a> stresses other factors for the British decision not to consider the proposal. The British were convinced they were dealing with a Himmler trick of some kind, he writes, possibly an attempt via Bandi Grosz to strike up a separate peace deal with the West in order to cause a rift between the Western Allies and the Soviet Union. Bauer also writes that, if the trucks-for-blood deal had gone through and large numbers of Jews had been released from Nazi-held territories, a consequence of them being gathered together and transported through <a href="/wiki/Central_Europe.html" title="Central Europe">Central Europe</a> would have been to halt Allied airborne military operations, and possibly also land-based ones, <sup id="_ref-Bauer170_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[48]</a></sup> turning the Jews, in effect, into <a href="/wiki/Human_shield.html" title="Human shield">human shields</a>. Bauer believes the British feared this may have been Himmler's primary motive in proposing the deal, because the suspension of Allied attacks would have allowed the Germans to concentrate more of their forces against the East.</p>
<p>Brand's failure to return to Budapest within the two weeks expected by Eichmann was regarded as a disaster by other members of the <a href="/wiki/Aid_and_Rescue_Committee.html" title="Aid and Rescue Committee">Aid and Rescue Committee</a>. A report written by Kastner states that Eichmann started demanding that Brand return, and wanted a "clear-cut answer" as to whether the blood-for-trucks proposal had been accepted. The report says: "We had to explain to him every day that discussions on this matter between <a href="/wiki/London.html" title="London">London</a>, <a href="/wiki/Washington%2C_D.C..html" title="Washington, D.C.">Washington</a> and <a href="/wiki/Moscow.html" title="Moscow">Moscow</a> could be protracted. There were enough reasons for delay. Apparently the Allies could not easily be brought to a common denominator about such a delicate matter. The continuation of the deportations of <a href="/wiki/History_of_the_Jews_in_Hungary.html" title="History of the Jews in Hungary">Hungarian Jews</a> was complicating the negotiations." On page 48 of the report, Kastner wrote "... on 9 June Eichmann said, 'If I do not receive a positive reply within three days, I shall operate the mill at Auschwitz'." <sup id="_ref-Eichmann2_1" class="reference"><a  title="">[32]</a></sup> (<i>Ich lasse die Muehle laufen.</i> <sup id="_ref-Hansi_2" class="reference"><a  title="">[11]</a></sup>)</p>

Sharett wrote in his report of June 27, 1944: "I must have looked a little incredulous, for he said: 'Please believe me: they have killed six million Jews; there are only two million left alive'." <sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a  title="">[49]</a></sup></p>
<p>After the second session, Sharett spoke to British officials and turned again to Brand, telling him: "Dear Joel, I have to tell you something bitter now." He told Brand he would have to "go south," not back to Budapest, because "[t]he British demand it." <sup id="_ref-Hilberg1223_1" class="reference"><a  title="">[47]</a></sup> Brand started screaming:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do you know what you are doing? This is simply murder! That is mass murder. If I don't return our best people will be slaughtered! My wife! My mother! My children will be first! ... I have come here under a flag of truce. I have brought you a message. You can accept or reject, but you have no right to hold the messenger ... <sup id="_ref-Hilberg1223_2" class="reference"><a  title="">[47]</a></sup></p>

<p>Despite his protests, Brand was taken to <a href="/wiki/Cairo.html" title="Cairo">Cairo</a>, where he was questioned by the British for ten or twelve hours every day. On the tenth day, he went on hunger strike, writing in a letter to the <a href="/wiki/Jewish_Agency_for_Israel.html" title="Jewish Agency for Israel">Jewish Agency</a> Executive that: "It is apparent to me now that an enemy of our people is holding me and does not intend to release me in the near future.

However, Brand repeated under oath during Eichmann's trial that it was Lord Moyne who had said it. <sup id="_ref-Hecht228.2F195_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[52]</a></sup></p>

<h2>The leak to the press and the end of the proposal</h2>
<p>British intelligence leaked details of the Brand mission to the press. On <a href="/wiki/July_19.html" title="July 19">July 19</a>, <a href="/wiki/1944.html" title="1944">1944</a>, <a href="/wiki/BBC_Radio.html" title="BBC Radio">BBC Radio</a> broadcast a story that two emissaries of the Hungarian government had appeared in Turkey proposing that all Jews still in Hungary would be allowed to leave if England and America would supply a certain amount of pharmaceuticals and transport, including trucks, with a promise that the equipment would not be used on the Western front. The proposal, which the BBC called "humanitarian blackmail" <sup id="_ref-Bauer192_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[54]</a></sup> was reported as a crude attempt to set the Allies against each other, and the report added that it was not clear whether the plan had the approval of the German and Hungarian authorities. Documents released during Eichmann's trial show that, after the broadcast, <a href="/wiki/Joachim_von_Ribbentrop.html" title="Joachim von Ribbentrop">Joachim von Ribbentrop</a>, the German Foreign Minister, asked to be informed about the facts of the matter. <sup id="_ref-Eichmann2_2" class="reference"><a  title="">[32]</a></sup> The <i>New York Herald Tribune</i> carried the same story and <i>The Times</i> of London called it one of the "most loathsome" stories of the war.</p>
<p>The leaks killed whatever might have remained of the initiative, although the mass deportations of Jews from Hungary had already been stopped by the Hungarian government on July 7, fearful that government ministers might be held personally responsible by the Allies.</p>
<p>The British released Brand in October 1944 but, according to <a href="/wiki/Ben_Hecht.html" title="Ben Hecht">Ben Hecht</a>, would not allow him to travel to Hungary, compelling him instead to travel to <a href="/wiki/British_Mandate_of_Palestine.html" title="British Mandate of Palestine">Palestine</a>. <a href="/wiki/Yehuda_Bauer.html" title="Yehuda Bauer">Yehuda Bauer</a> disputes this, arguing that the story of Brand being forced to travel to Palestine was spread around Israel at the time of the trial of <a href="/wiki/Malchiel_Greenwald.html" title="Malchiel Greenwald">Malchiel Greenwald</a>, a freelance writer who accused Kastner, by then a government spokesman, of having collaborated with the Nazis. The story was repeated by <a href="/wiki/Amos_Elon.html" title="Amos Elon">Amos Elon</a> in his <i>Timetable: The Story of Joel Brand</i> in 1981. In fact, writes Bauer, by that time Brand himself was terrified of returning to Budapest, convinced the Germans would murder him.</p>
<p>In Palestine, Brand tried to contact <a href="/wiki/Chaim_Weizmann.html" title="Chaim Weizmann">Chaim Weizmann</a>, the president of the <a href="/wiki/World_Zionist_Organization.html" title="World Zionist Organization">World Zionist Organization</a>. Weizmann responded to Brand's letter, saying that his secretary would arrange an appointment for the men to meet. Brand alleges that the appointment was never made. The last lines of Brand's testimony to the District Court in Jerusalem during the libel trial were: "Rightly or wrongly, for better or for worse, I have cursed Jewry's official leaders ever since. All these things shall haunt me until my dying day. It is much more than a man can bear." <sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a  title="">[55]</a></sup></p>

<a href="/wiki/Heinrich_Himmler.html" title="Heinrich Himmler">Heinrich Himmler</a> in 1945. It is obvious, argues <a href="/wiki/Yehuda_Bauer.html" title="Yehuda Bauer">Yehuda Bauer</a>, that <a href="/wiki/Adolf_Eichmann.html" title="Adolf Eichmann">Adolf Eichmann</a> was Himmler's reluctant messenger during the meetings with Brand.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Bauer writes that we know the deal originated with <a href="/wiki/Heinrich_Himmler.html" title="Heinrich Himmler">Heinrich Himmler</a> because a cable from Edmund Veesenmayer of the SS to the German Foreign Office on <a href="/wiki/July_22.html" title="July 22">July 22</a>, <a href="/wiki/1944.html" title="1944">1944</a> stated that Brand and Grosz had been sent to Turkey on the orders of Himmler. <sup id="_ref-Bauer167_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[56]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Kurt_Becher.html" title="Kurt Becher">Kurt Becher</a> also indicated that his orders came direct from Himmler: "So I came into contact with Joel Brand ... Trucks were a big problem. So trucks were discussed, 10,000 trucks that is. There were many discussions. Himmler said to me: 'Take whatever you can from the Jews. Promise them whatever you want. What we will keep is another matter'." <sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a  title="">[57]</a></sup></p>
<p>Eichmann himself later testified that the order came from Himmler, and a report from Kastner shows that Eichmann did not seem happy about having to deal with Brand. Kastner wrote that when Brand failed to return from Istanbul, Eichmann said: ""Yes. I saw all of this in advance. I warned Becher countless times not to allow himself to be led by the nose. If I do not receive a positive answer within forty-eight hours, I will have all this Jewish bag of filth from Budapest laid low." (<i>Werde ich das ganze juedische Dreckpack von Budapest umlegen lassen</i>.) <sup id="_ref-Eichmann2_3" class="reference"><a  title="">[32]</a></sup></p>
<p>Bauer writes that the "clumsiness of the approach has been a wonderment to all observers." <sup id="_ref-Bauer167_1" class="reference"><a  title="">[56]</a></sup> He argues that it is obvious that Eichmann was Himmler's reluctant messenger, and that Eichmann's own inclination was clearly to continue murdering Jews, not to sell them. On the day that Brand left for Vienna and Istanbul, Eichmann traveled to <a href="/wiki/Auschwitz_concentration_camp.html" title="Auschwitz concentration camp">Auschwitz</a> to make sure that <a href="/wiki/Rudolf_Hoess.html" title="Rudolf Hoess">Rudolf Hoess</a>, the commander of the camp, would be ready to receive the first arrivals due to leave Hungary on May 14. <sup id="_ref-Bauer167_2" class="reference"><a  title="">[56]</a></sup> Hoess told him there would be problems processing such large numbers, whereupon Eichmann ordered that there should be no selections but that all the new arrivals should be gassed immediately, <sup id="_ref-Bauer168_1" class="reference"><a  title="">[6]</a></sup> which does not indicate that he was willing to delay the exterminations until Brand returned from Istanbul, as Brand seemed to believe.</p>
<p>Bauer argues that the presence of Clages at the meetings signals that Himmler had changed the emphasis from trucks-for-blood to the hidden agenda of secret talks aimed at peace. Bauer writes that there is no indication of what exactly Himmler wanted to achieve, because he did not commit his thoughts to paper, but Bauer points out that Brand and Grosz arrived in Istanbul just two months before the <a href="/wiki/July_20.html" title="July 20">July 20</a>, <a href="/wiki/1944.html" title="1944">1944</a> assassination attempt on <a href="/wiki/Adolf_Hitler.html" title="Adolf Hitler">Hitler</a>, and that Himmler knew there was a plot, though did not know where and when it would be carried out. <sup id="_ref-Bauer168_2" class="reference"><a  title="">[6]</a></sup> It is possible that Himmler wanted to open negotiations for peace in the event that Hitler did not survive, using two low-level agents, a Jew and a spy, in case he had to distance himself from their mission; and if Hitler did survive, Himmler could offer him the chance to conclude a separate peace deal with the West, excluding the <a href="/wiki/Soviet_Union.html" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a>. <sup id="_ref-Bauer168_3" class="reference"><a  title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>Brand himself eventually adopted such a theory. Two months before his death he testified at the trial in Germany of Eichmann's deputies Hermann Krumey and Otto Hunsche. He told the court that "though the deal was suggested by Eichmann" it must have originated in the mind of Himmler as one of his desperate attempts at driving a wedge between the Allies. "I made a terrible mistake in passing this on to the British. ... It is now clear to me that Himmler sought to sow suspicion among the Allies as a preparation for his much desired Nazi-Western coalition against Moscow." <sup id="_ref-24" class="reference"><a  title="">[58]</a></sup></p>

<p><a name="Aftermath" id="Aftermath"></a></p>
<h2>Aftermath</h2>
<p>In Budapest, the <i>Vaada</i> had waited anxiously for Brand's return and for some news that <a href="/wiki/Allies_of_World_War_II.html" title="Allies of World War II">the Allies</a> would help. <a href="/wiki/Raul_Hilberg.html" title="Raul Hilberg">Hilberg</a> writes that the committee did not expect the Allies actually to supply goods to <a href="/wiki/Adolf_Eichmann.html" title="Adolf Eichmann">Eichmann</a>, but it hoped for some gesture that would allow protracted negotiations with the Nazis to begin while the Jews waited for the arrival of the <a href="/wiki/Red_Army.html" title="Red Army">Red Army</a>. <sup id="_ref-Hilberg904_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[59]</a></sup> Brand's failure to return to Budapest meant the <i>Vaada</i> was thrown back on its own resources, bitter about the lack of help from the outside world, and in particular from Jews living in safe countries.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Yehuda_Bauer.html" title="Yehuda Bauer">Bauer</a> argues that the mistake the <i>Vaada</i> made was to adopt the almost <a href="/wiki/Anti-Semitism.html" title="Anti-Semitism">anti-Semitic</a> belief in unlimited Jewish power. <sup id="_ref-Bauer170_1" class="reference"><a  title="">[48]</a></sup> The committee believed that Jewish leaders could move freely during the war and could persuade the Allies to do whatever needed to be done to save the Jews of Hungary. They had similar trust in the goodwill and power of the Allied leadership, but the Allies were gearing up for the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Normandy.html" title="Battle of Normandy">Normandy invasion</a> just as Brand set out on his mission, and "[a]t that crucial moment," writes Bauer, "to antagonize the Soviets because of some hare-brained <a href="/wiki/Gestapo.html" title="Gestapo">Gestapo</a> plan to ransom Jews was totally out of the question." <sup id="_ref-Bauer171_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[60]</a></sup> Bauer writes: "Perhaps, in their hopeless situation, [the Aid and Rescue Committee] had to believe these things in order to survive, but when their beliefs had to be tested against the cold realities of a world war, they proved to be so many illusions." <sup id="_ref-Bauer171_1" class="reference"><a  title="">[60]</a></sup></p>
<p>Kastner later wrote that the <i>Vaada</i> had no choice but to believe in the possibility of rescue. Of Jewish communities living in countries unaffected by the Holocaust, he wrote: "They were outside, we were inside. They moralized, we feared death. They had sympathy for us and believed themselves to be powerless; we wanted to live and believed rescue <i>had</i> to be possible." <sup id="_ref-25" class="reference"><a  title="">[61]</a></sup></p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/May_27.html" title="May 27">May 27</a>, <a href="/wiki/1944.html" title="1944">1944</a>, Hansi Brand was arrested and beaten, though she testified at Eichmann's trial that she withstood it and gave the Hungarians no information <sup id="_ref-Bauer197_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[62]</a></sup> about the deal that Eichmann had told her was a "state secret" (<i>Reichsgeheimnis</i>). Brand was a bitter man when released by the British; he joined the <a href="/wiki/Lehi_%28group%29.html" title="Lehi (group)">Lehi</a> (Stern Gang) who were fighting to remove the British from the land that became the <a href="/wiki/State_of_Israel.html" title="State of Israel">State of Israel</a> in 1948. The Istanbul mission created a rift between him and his wife, who for many years wondered what the truth was behind her husband's inability to return to Budapest.</p>
<p>Bauer concludes that, despite the haphazard nature of the mission and its ultimate failure, Brand was an extremely courageous man who had passionately wanted to help the Jewish people, and yet whose life was thereafter plagued by the suspicion of family and friends, part of a serious misunderstanding, according to Bauer, of "all the Jewish actors in the situation." <sup id="_ref-Bauer194_2" class="reference"><a  title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Brand died in Israel in 1964, probably of liver disease brought on by <a href="/wiki/Alcoholism.html" title="Alcoholism">alcoholism</a>. <sup id="_ref-Bauer194_3" class="reference"><a  title="">[1]</a></sup></p>

<li id="_note-11"><b><a  title="">^</a></b> Between May 15 and July 7, 1944, 437,402 Jews were recorded as having been deported on 120 trains from Hungary to Auschwitz. There were 45 cattle cars in each train with an average of 70 Jews in each car, sharing one bucket of water. The exact number in each car was marked in chalk on the outside. The country was split into zones, and from Zones I and II, an average of 12,000 people were deported daily, according to a memo from Edmund Veesenmayer to the German Foreign Office, June 13, 1944, NG-5619. From Zones I and II, 289,357 had been deported by June 7; from Zone III, 50,805 by June 17; from Zone IV, 41,499 by June 30; and from Zone V, 55,741 by July 9.

<li id="_note-13"><b><a  title="">^</a></b> Yehuda Bauer argues that Brandt's inconsistent testimony on this issue may be important because of Brand's later allegation that his arrest by the British was designed to, and did, have the effect of ensuring that he was unable to return to Budapest in time, and that because of this delay, the blood-for-trucks deal fell through and the mass murders continued. However, as the deportations began on May 15 and ended on July 7, 1944, after 437,000 Jews had been sent to Auschwitz, it remains unclear whether Brand's inconsistency in this regard is of any historical importance, because whether he had intended to return to Budapest within one week or three, he was prevented from returning before October, at least.</li>
