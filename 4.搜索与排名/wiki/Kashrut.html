<p><i><b>Kashrut</b></i> or <i><b>Kashruth</b></i>, <i><b>Kashrus</b></i> (<a href="/wiki/Hebrew_language.html" title="Hebrew language">Hebrew</a>: <b>כַּשְרוּת <span class="Unicode">kašrûṯ</span></b>) or "keeping <b>kosher</b>" (Hebrew: <b>כָּשֵר <span class="Unicode">kāšēr</span></b>) is the name of the <a href="/wiki/Judaism.html" title="Judaism">Jewish</a> dietary laws. <a href="/wiki/Food.html" title="Food">Food</a> in accord with <i><a href="/wiki/Halakha.html" title="Halakha">halakha</a></i> (Jewish law) is termed <b>kosher</b> in <a href="/wiki/English_language.html" title="English language">English</a>, from the <a href="/wiki/Hebrew_language.html" title="Hebrew language">Hebrew</a> term <i>kasher</i>, meaning "fit" (in this context, fit for consumption by observant Jews).</p>
<p>Food not in accord with Jewish law is termed <i>treifah</i> or <i>tareif</i> (טְרֵפָה <span class="Unicode">ṭərēp̄āh</span>) ("torn"); the term originally referred to animals (from a kosher <a href="/wiki/Species.html" title="Species">species</a> such as <a href="/wiki/Cattle.html" title="Cattle">cattle</a> or <a href="/wiki/Domestic_sheep.html" title="Domestic sheep">sheep</a>) which had been either incorrectly slaughtered or mortally wounded by wild beasts and therefore were not fit for human consumption. Among <i><a href="/wiki/Sephardim.html" title="Sephardim">Sephardim</a></i>, it typically only refers to meat that is not kosher.</p>
<p>The basic laws of <i>kashrut</i> are in the <a href="/wiki/Torah.html" title="Torah">Torah</a>'s Book of <a href="/wiki/Leviticus.html" title="Leviticus">Leviticus</a>, with their details set down in the <a href="/wiki/Oral_law.html" title="Oral law">oral law</a> (the <a href="/wiki/Mishnah.html" title="Mishnah">Mishnah</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Talmud.html" title="Talmud">Talmud</a>) and codified by the <i><a href="/wiki/Shulkhan_Arukh.html" title="Shulkhan Arukh">Shulkhan Arukh</a></i> and later <a href="/wiki/Rabbi.html" title="Rabbi">rabbinical</a> <a href="/wiki/Rabbinic_literature.html" title="Rabbinic literature">authorities</a>. Many varied reasons have been offered for these laws, ranging from philosophical and ritualistic, to practical and hygienic; see below for examples and explanations.</p>
<p>The word <i><a  class="extiw" title="wiktionary:kosher">kosher</a></i> has been borrowed by many languages, including English. In its strictest meaning it means only "suitable according to Jewish law", but as slang it generally means legitimate, acceptable, permissible, genuine or authentic in a broader sense.</p>

<p>Foods are kosher when they meet all criteria that Jewish law applies to food. Invalidating characteristics may range from the presence of a mixture of meat and milk, to the use of produce from Israel that has not been tithed properly, or even the use of cooking utensils which had previously been used for non-kosher food.</p>

</dl>
</div>
<p>Store-bought foods can be identified as kosher by the presence of a <i><a href="/wiki/Hechsher.html" title="Hechsher">hechsher</a></i> (plural <i>hechsherim</i>), a graphical symbol that indicates that the food has been certified as kosher by a rabbinical authority. (This might be an individual rabbi, but is more often a rabbinic organization.) One of the most common symbols in the United States is the "OU", a U inside a circle, standing for the <a href="/wiki/Union_of_Orthodox_Congregations.html" title="Union of Orthodox Congregations">Union of Orthodox Congregations</a> (or "Orthodox Union"). Many rabbis and organizations, however, have their own <a href="/wiki/Certification_mark.html" title="Certification mark">certification mark</a>, and the other symbols are too numerous to list.</p>
<p>The <i>hechsherim</i> of certain authorities are sometimes considered invalid by certain other authorities. A solitary K is sometimes used as a symbol for <i>kashrut</i>, but as this symbol cannot be <a href="/wiki/Trademark.html" title="Trademark">trademarked</a> (the method by which other symbols are protected from misuse), it does NOT indicate anything other than the fact that the company producing the food considers it to be kosher.</p>
<p>It is not sufficient to read the list of ingredients on a product label in order to determine a food's kosher status, as many things are not included in this list, such as pan lubricants and release agents (which may be derived from <a href="/wiki/Lard.html" title="Lard">lard</a>), flavorings (even "natural <a href="/wiki/Flavouring.html" title="Flavouring">flavorings</a>" may be derived from non-kosher substances) and others. It can, however, identify obviously unkosher substances present in food.</p>
<p>Producers of food items and food additives can contact Jewish authorities to have their product deemed kosher. A committee will visit their facilities to inspect production methods and contents of the product and issue a certificate if everything is in order. In many product classes, constant supervision is required.</p>
<p>For various reasons, such as changes in manufacturing processes, products known to be <i>kosher</i> on one day might not be kosher tomorrow; a change in lubricating oil to one containing <a href="/wiki/Tallow.html" title="Tallow">tallow</a>, for instance. Often, these changes will be coordinated with the supervising rabbi or organization, to ensure that new packaging, which will not suggest any <i>hechsher</i> or <i>kashrut</i>, will be used for the new formulation. But in some cases, the supply of preprinted labels with the <i>hechsher</i> may still find its way onto the now non-kosher product; for such reasons, there is an active "grapevine" among the Jewish community, as well as newspapers and periodicals, identifying which products are now questionable, as well as products which have become kosher but whose labels have yet to carry the <i>hechsher</i>.</p>

<p><a name="Reasons_for_the_Biblical_dietary_laws" id="Reasons_for_the_Biblical_dietary_laws"></a></p>
<h2>Reasons for the Biblical dietary laws</h2>
<p>There continues to be a debate on the purposes and meaning of the laws regarding <i>Kashrut</i>.</p>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/Jewish_philosophy.html" title="Jewish philosophy">Jewish philosophy</a> it is recognized that many of the <a href="/wiki/613_mitzvot.html" title="613 mitzvot">613 <i>mitzvot</i></a> cannot be explained rationally. They are categorized as <i>chukim</i>, comprising such laws as the <a href="/wiki/Red_Heifer.html" title="Red Heifer">Red Heifer</a> (<a href="/wiki/Book_of_Numbers.html" title="Book of Numbers">Numbers</a> 19). There are three basic points of view regarding these laws:</p>
<ul>
<li>One view holds that these laws <i>do</i> have a reason, but it is not understood because the ultimate explanation for <i><a href="/wiki/Mitzvot.html" title="Mitzvot">mitzvot</a></i> is beyond the human intellect.</li>
<li>A second view holds that most of the laws have some historical and/or dietary significance (such as preventing the consumption of unhealthy food, or differentiating oneself from non-Jews through dietary restrictions); and</li>
<li>A third view holds that these laws have no meaning other than to instill obedience.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd><i>Some Jewish scholars have held that these dietary laws should simply be categorized with a group of laws that are considered irrational in that there is no particular explanation for their existence. The reason for this is that there are some of God's regulations for mankind that the human mind is not necessarily capable of understanding. Related to this is the idea that the dietary laws were given as a demonstration of God's authority and that man should obey without asking for a reason</i> (William H. Shea, <i>Clean and Unclean Meats</i>, Biblical Research Institute, December 1988).</dd>
</dl>
<p>The latter view, however, has been rejected by most classical and modern Jewish authorities, and by modern biblical scholars. For example, <a href="/wiki/Maimonides.html" title="Maimonides">Maimonides</a> holds that all the laws given by God have a reason, that we are permitted to seek out what these reasons may be, and that we should feel comfortable in knowing that rational reasons exist for all of God's laws in the Torah, even if we are not sure of what some of these reasons are. For Maimonides, the idea that God gave laws without any reason is <a href="/wiki/Anathema.html" title="Anathema">anathema</a>. <sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a  title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Others argue that laws in the category of <i>chukim</i> were given <i>because</i> of the well-known Jewish tendency to rationalize and probe - a sort of reminder that, while the Universe is generally explainable, one cannot possibly understand everything.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Ritual purity and holiness">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Ritual_purity_and_holiness" id="Ritual_purity_and_holiness"></a></p>
<h3>Ritual purity and holiness</h3>
<p>According to the <a href="/wiki/Bible.html" title="Bible">Biblical</a> book of <a href="/wiki/Leviticus.html" title="Leviticus">Leviticus</a>, the purpose of the laws is related to ritual purity and holiness. Indeed, the <a href="/wiki/Hebrew_language.html" title="Hebrew language">Hebrew</a> word for "holiness" is etymologically related to the Hebrew word for "distinction" or "separation." This idea is generally accepted by most Jews today, and by many modern biblical scholars. Cultural anthropologist <a href="/wiki/Mary_Douglas.html" title="Mary Douglas">Mary Douglas</a> has written an important work on just how the Israelites may have used the idea of distinction as a way to create holiness. Her seminal work, <i>Purity and Danger</i> (1966), is still studied today. One theory widely accepted today is that the laws serve as a distinction between the Israelites and the non-Israelite nations of the world. Gordon Wenham writes: "The laws reminded Israel what sort of behaviour was expected of her, that she had been chosen to be holy in an unclean world."</p>
<p>Similarly, the practice of <i>Kashrut</i> serves as a daily exercise in self-discipline and self-control, strengthening the practitioner's ability to choose other difficult paths. The ability to rationally curb one's most basic appetites can be seen as the prerequisite to living in a civilized society. Also, Jews consider the aspects of Kosher slaughter which emphasize and incorporate the need to avoid unnecessary suffering of the animal a reminder to the believer that having the power of life and death or to cause suffering, even to a farm animal born and bred to be eaten, is a serious responsibility rather than a pleasure to be sought after; and that to actually indulge in pleasure in the power to cause suffering, even in so common a practice as hunting, is to damage our own moral sensibilities.</p>
<p>The prohibition against eating the fruits of a tree for the first three years also represents a capacity for self-discipline and self-denial, as well as a lengthy period of appreciation for the bounty of God, prior to losing oneself in its enjoyment. Similarly, the requirement to tithe one's harvest, aside from the social justice aspect, serves as a reminder that this material wealth is not purely the result of one's own efforts, but represents a gift from God; and as such, to share the gift with one's fellows does not represent a real loss to anyone, even oneself.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Symbolic purpose">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Symbolic_purpose" id="Symbolic_purpose"></a></p>
<h3>Symbolic purpose</h3>
<p>During the first few centuries of the <a href="/wiki/Common_Era.html" title="Common Era">Common Era</a> some philosophers held that the laws of <i>kashrut</i> were symbolic in character. In this view, kosher animals represent virtues, while non-kosher animals represent vices. The first indication of this view can be found in the 1st century BCE <a href="/wiki/Letter_of_Aristeas.html" title="Letter of Aristeas">Letter of Aristeas</a> (par. 145-148, 153). It later reappears in the writings of <a href="/wiki/Philo.html" title="Philo">Philo</a> of Alexandria, and in the writings of some of the early Church fathers.</p>
<p>This hypothesis has long since been rejected by most Jewish and Christian scholars. Modern biblical criticism also has found nothing to support this hypothesis, although the concept of the pig as a particularly 'unclean' animal persists among Jews.</p>
<p>Although the symbolic explanation for <i>kashrut</i> has been largely rejected, a number of authorities maintain that the laws are intended to promote ethical and moral behaviour. A recent authority who has reexamined the symbolic/ethical meaning of <i>kashrut</i> is <a href="/wiki/Rabbi.html" title="Rabbi">Rabbi</a> <a href="/wiki/Samson_Raphael_Hirsch.html" title="Samson Raphael Hirsch">Samson Raphael Hirsch</a> (Germany, 19th century).</p>
<p>To some degree, the prohibition on combining milk with meat represents a symbolic separation between death, represented by the flesh of a dead animal, and life, represented by the milk required to sustain a newborn creature. The often-quoted humane component to this law is also of symbolic value; the <a href="/wiki/Torah.html" title="Torah">Torah</a> prohibits 'seething the kid (goat, sheep, calf) in its mother's milk', a practice cruel only in concept, which would not be understood as cruelty by either the kid or its mother and would not cause them additional suffering; but which could still potentially inflame a human's taste for ultimate power over those creatures who are weaker. Thus, <i>Kashrut</i> prohibits the practice itself, even if the resulting mixture is to be discarded.</p>
<p>Similarly, the prohibition against consuming carnivorous mammals and birds, 'loathsome crawling creatures', and scavengers, as well as the prohibition against consuming sick or diseased animals, would seem to rely, at least in part, on their perceived symbolic character.</p>

<p><a name="Maintenance_of_a_separate_culture" id="Maintenance_of_a_separate_culture"></a></p>
<h3>Maintenance of a separate culture</h3>
<p>Related to the concept of <i>kashrut</i> being one aspect of Judaism is the practical outcome of maintaining a specific national diet which helps maintain Jews as a separate people. The laws of <i>Kashrut</i> had the effect of preventing socialization and intermarriage with non-Jews, helping the Jewish community maintain its identity. Wenham writes that</p>
<dl>
<dd>"<a href="/wiki/Circumcision.html" title="Circumcision">circumcision</a> was a private matter, but the food laws made one's Jewish faith a public affair. Observance of the food laws was one of the outward marks of a practising Jew, and this in turn enhanced Jewish attachment to them as a reminder of their special status" (Gordon J. Wenham, "The Theology of Unclean Food," The Evangelical Quarterly 53, January March 1981, p.6-15).</dd>

<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Hygiene">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Hygiene" id="Hygiene"></a></p>
<h3>Hygiene</h3>
<p>There have been attempts to provide empirical support for the view that <i>kashrut</i> laws have hygienic benefits. However, this has never been the traditional Jewish view.</p>
<p>It was believed by some people that kosher animals were healthier to eat than non-kosher animals. It was also noted that the laws of purity (<a href="/wiki/Leviticus.html" title="Leviticus">Leviticus</a> 11–15) not only describe the difference between clean and unclean animals, but also describe other phenomena that appear to be related to health. For instance, <i>glatt</i>, the requirement that lungs be checked to be free of adhesions, would prevent consumption of animals who had been infected with tuberculosis; similarly, the ban on slaughtering of an unconscious animal would eliminate many sick and possibly infectious animals from being consumed. Such a rationale seems reasonable when considering the laws prohibiting the consumption of carrion birds or birds of prey (which are advantageous scavengers), as they may carry disease from the carrion they consume; shellfish, which as filter feeders can accumulate harmful parasites or toxins; or pork, which can harbor <a href="/wiki/Trichinosis.html" title="Trichinosis">trichinosis</a> if not properly cooked. Thus, it was natural for many to assume that all the laws of <i>kashrut</i> were merely hygienic in intent and origin. One of the rabbinical authorities that mention the hygiene hypothesis is <a href="/wiki/Maimonides.html" title="Maimonides">Maimonides</a> in his <a href="/wiki/Guide_for_the_Perplexed.html" title="Guide for the Perplexed">Guide for the Perplexed</a>.</p>
<p>For a number of reasons, however, this idea has fallen out of favor among biblical scholars, and has never been accepted by the majority of Jews. Fruits and vegetables may be eaten without prohibition even though there are many poisonous herbs, seeds, berries and fruits. Additionally, this hypothesis does not explain other parts of the Jewish dietary laws; for instance forbidding the consumption of fish without true scales, such as sharks and swordfish, fruit from trees which are less than four years old, or residual blood in meat.</p>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/1953.html" title="1953">1953</a> <a href="/wiki/David_Macht.html" title="David Macht">Dr. David I. Macht</a>, a Johns Hopkins researcher, performed <a href="/wiki/Experiment.html" title="Experiment">experiments</a> on many different kinds of animals and fish, and concluded that the concentration of zoological toxins of the "<a  title="Kosher foods">unclean</a>" animals was higher than that of the "clean" animals, and that the correlation with the description in Leviticus was 100%.<a  class="external autonumber" title="http://members.dslextreme.com/users/hollymick/Macht1953.pdf">[2]</a> (Macht D, (1953). "An Experimental Pharmacological Appreciation of Levitcus XI and Deuteronomy XIV". Bull Hist Med 27:444-450). In addition, Dr. Macht's research indicated harmful physiological effects of mixtures of meat and milk, and ritually slaughtered meat appeared to be lower in toxins than meat from other sources (see: David I. Macht, Medical Leaves 1940; 3:174-184 ). The conclusions of the paper published in Johns Hopkins Bulletin of the History of Medicine was challenged in a paper by biologists written at the request of a <a href="/wiki/Seventh-day_Adventist_Church.html" title="Seventh-day Adventist Church">Seventh-day Adventist Church</a> publication <sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a  title="">[2]</a></sup>.</p>

Earlier court decisions upheld some of these laws. The courts have since determined that because this represents a state <a href="/wiki/Lemon_test.html" title="Lemon test">establishment of a religious practice</a>, when such laws have been challenged, they have been struck down.</p>
<ul>
<li>Baltimore's City ordinance creating a kosher law was found to be unconstitutional: <i><a  class="external text" title="http://www.law.emory.edu/4circuit/oct95/941918.p.html">Barghout v. Bureau of Kosher Meat &amp; Food Control</a></i>, <a href="/wiki/Case_citation.html" title="Case citation">66 F. 3d 1337</a> (4th Cir. 1995).</li>
<li>New Jersey's Kosher laws were found to violate the Establishment clauses of both the New Jersey state constitution and the First Amendment: <i>Perretti v. Ran-Dav's County Kosher Inc.</i>, <a href="/wiki/Case_citation.html" title="Case citation">289 N.J. Super 618</a>, 674 A. 2d 647 (Superior Ct. Appellate Div 1996). The opinion was affirmed by the <a href="/wiki/New_Jersey_Supreme_Court.html" title="New Jersey Supreme Court">New Jersey Supreme Court</a> in which it found that the State's use of "Orthodox Jewish law" as a basis for the definition of kosher was an adoption of substantive religious standards which violated the State and Federal constitutions. <a href="/wiki/Case_citation.html" title="Case citation">129 N.J. 155</a>. The State's response was to create a new law which avoids any definition of a standard for what is or is not considered kosher. Instead, establishments which claim to be kosher must publicize what they mean by that, and the State will check to ensure that this standard is adhered to. For example, kosher restaurants must display a poster (provided by the Kosher Food Enforcement Bureau) on which they display the name of their rabbinic certifier, how often he inspects the place, whether or not he requires all ingredients to be kosher-supervised, and so on. In this manner, government enforcement becomes a consumer-protection issue, and avoids the problems of advancing any particular religious view.</li>
<li>The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit found that the challenged provisions of New York's Kosher Fraud law "on their face violate the Establishment Clause because they excessively entangle the State of New York with religion and impermissibly advance Orthodox Judaism." <i><a  class="external text" title="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=2nd&amp;navby=case&amp;no=009116&amp;exact=1">Commack Self-Serv.

<p>Those who oppose the above rulings argue that <i>kashrut</i> is simply a set of standards for food preparation, nothing more; there is no difference between labelling something "low sodium", "high-fiber", "pasteurized" "kosher", "calcium-enriched", or "contains no cholesterol".</p>

<h2>How kashrut is viewed by Judaism today</h2>
<p><a href="/wiki/Orthodox_Judaism.html" title="Orthodox Judaism">Orthodox Judaism</a> and <a href="/wiki/Conservative_Judaism.html" title="Conservative Judaism">Conservative Judaism</a> hold that Jews should follow the laws of <i>kashrut</i>. Some of <a href="/wiki/Reform_Judaism.html" title="Reform Judaism">Reform Judaism</a> and <a href="/wiki/Reconstructionist_Judaism.html" title="Reconstructionist Judaism">Reconstructionist Judaism</a> think that these laws are no longer binding to them. Some parts of the Reform community have begun to move towards a more traditional position.<sup title="The text in the vicinity of this tag needs citation." class="noprint">[<a  title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><i>citation&#160;needed</i></a>]</sup> This tradition-leaning faction agrees with mainstream Reform that the rules concerning <i>kashrut</i> are no longer binding to them, but holds that keeping kosher is an important way for people to bring holiness into their lives. Thus Jews are encouraged to consider adopting some or all of the rules of <i>kashrut</i> on a voluntary basis. The Reconstructionist movement advocates that its members accept some of the rules of <i>kashrut</i>, but does so in a non-binding fashion; their stance on <i>kashrut</i> is the same as the tradition-leaning wing of Reform.</p>
<p>Many Jews who do not meet the complete requirements of <i>Kashrut</i> nevertheless maintain some subset of the laws; for instance, abstaining from pork or shellfish. Many Jews will likewise avoid drinking milk with a meat dish. Similarly, many keep a degree of <i>Kashrut</i> at home while having no problems eating in a non-kosher restaurant.</p>

<h3>In common vernacular</h3>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/English_language.html" title="English language">English</a> and <a href="/wiki/Hebrew_language.html" title="Hebrew language">Hebrew</a>, the term <i>kosher</i> is frequently used in a metaphorical sense to mean "fitting" or "correct", which is its conventional meaning in <a href="/wiki/Hebrew_language.html" title="Hebrew language">Hebrew</a>.</p>
<p>It is also part of some common product names. For example, "<a href="/wiki/Kosher_salt.html" title="Kosher salt">kosher salt</a>" (technically "kashering salt") is a form of salt which has irregularly-shaped crystals, making it particularly suitable for preparing meat in accordance with <i>Kashrut</i> law because the increased surface area of the crystals absorbs blood more effectively. Likewise, a "kosher pickle" is a particular style of <a href="/wiki/Pickled_cucumber.html" title="Pickled cucumber">pickle</a> that originated in Eastern European kosher delicatessens with a distinctive flavor. This is the same reason why the usage of the term "kosher-style" became frequently used in the food industry, from delis to restaurants, and even street vendors.</p>

<p><a name="Protection_of_the_term" id="Protection_of_the_term"></a></p>
<h3>Protection of the term</h3>
<p>Consumer-protection laws in many jurisdictions prohibit use of the term "kosher" unless it is shown to conform to Jewish dietary laws, however this will be defined differently for different jurisdictions and situations. For example, in some places the law may require that a rabbi certify the <i>kashrut</i>, and in others it is sufficient that the manufacturer believes the product to be kosher. Most packaged food products that are labelled "kosher" will therefore have some level of certification of compliance with the laws of <i>kashrut</i>, though individuals must determine if that level is adequate for themselves. More detail on the "legal" usage of the term "kosher" can be found in the section above entiled "U.S. Laws regarding use of the word <i>Kosher</i>"</p>

<p><a name="Israeli_usage_of_the_term" id="Israeli_usage_of_the_term"></a></p>
<h3>Israeli usage of the term</h3>
<p>A new movement in Israel <sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a  title="">[3]</a></sup> demands that an establishment - a grocery store or restaurant - will only be considered fully kosher if its employees are paid a decent wage and treated fairly, and there is access for the handicapped. This will require a second certificate of <i>kashrut</i> in addition to the standard one.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Vegetarianism">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Vegetarianism" id="Vegetarianism"></a></p>
<h2>Vegetarianism</h2>
<p>Since there are few laws of <i>Kashrut</i> restricting the consumption of plant products it follows that a strictly <a href="/wiki/Vegetarian.html" title="Vegetarian">vegetarian</a> meal would usually be inherently Kosher (as long as the milk and wine and bread are supervised and the utensils were only used for Kosher food and are never used for unsupervised milk, and the fruit comes from trees older than four years). In practice, however, those who follow the laws of <i>Kashrut</i> do not automatically regard all restaurants or prepared or canned food which claim to be vegetarian as Kosher, due to the likelihood that the utensils were used previously with non-Kosher products, and the concern that there may be non-kosher ingredients mixed in, which although they may still be considered vegetarian, would make the food not kosher. Many vegetarian restaurants and producers of vegetarian foods do acquire a <a href="/wiki/Hechsher.html" title="Hechsher"><i>hechsher</i></a>, certifying that a Rabbinical organization has approved of them as Kosher. Certain vegetables would still need to be checked for insect infestation and a Jew would still need to turn on the pilot light on the oven to ensure the food was <i>bishul Yisrael</i>. (<i>Bishul Yisrael</i> means "cooking of Israel," that is, prepared with the involvement of an observant Jew).</p>
<p>Most <a href="/wiki/Vegetable.html" title="Vegetable">vegetables</a>, particularly <a href="/wiki/Leafy_vegetables.html" title="Leafy vegetables">leafy vegetables</a> (<a href="/wiki/Lettuce.html" title="Lettuce">lettuce</a>, <a href="/wiki/Cabbage.html" title="Cabbage">cabbage</a>, <a href="/wiki/Parsley.html" title="Parsley">parsley</a>, <a href="/wiki/Dill.html" title="Dill">dill</a>, etc.), must be thoroughly checked for insect infestation. The consumption of insects involves five violations of Torah law<sup title="The text in the vicinity of this tag needs citation." class="noprint">[<a  title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><i>citation&#160;needed</i></a>]</sup>, so according to Jewish Law it is a greater sin than the consumption of pork. The proper procedure for inspecting and cleaning will vary by species, growing conditions, and the views of any particular rabbi.</p>
<p>The situation is not always reversible, however; although <i><a href="/wiki/Pareve#Pareve.html" title="Pareve">pareve</a></i> food can contain neither meat nor dairy, that label on a product cannot be always used by vegetarians as a reliable indication, since <i>Kashrut</i> considers fish to be <i>pareve</i>. However, in practice it is rare to find fish products in <i>pareve</i> foods; moreover, because of potential issues of mixing meat and fish (see <a  title="Kosher foods">Fish and seafood</a>) many <i>Kashrut</i> supervising authorities specifically indicate the presence of fish products when they are found in <i>pareve</i> foods.</p>
<p>People who have specific dietary needs should be aware that their standards for certain concepts may differ from the halachic standards for similar concepts.</p>
<ul>
<li>Many coffee creamers currently sold in the United States are labeled as "non-dairy", yet also have a "D" alongside their <i>hechsher</i>, which indicates a dairy status. This is because of an ingredient (usually sodium caseinate) which is derived from milk. The rabbis consider it to be close enough to milk that it cannot be mixed with meat, but the US government considers it to lack the nutritional value of milk. Such products are also unsuitable for <a href="/wiki/Vegan.html" title="Vegan">vegans</a> and other strict dairy abstainers.</li>
<li>On the other hand, <i>kashrut</i> <i>does</i> recognize some processes as capable of converting a meat or dairy product into a <i>pareve</i> one. For example, <a href="/wiki/Rennet.html" title="Rennet">rennet</a> is sometimes made from stomach linings, yet is acceptable for making kosher cheese<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a  title="">[4]</a></sup>, but such cheeses might not be acceptable to some vegetarians, who would eat only cheese made from a vegetarian rennin. The same applies to kosher <a href="/wiki/Gelatin.html" title="Gelatin">gelatin</a> which in some cases is an <a href="/wiki/Animal_product.html" title="Animal product">animal product</a>, despite its <i>pareve</i> status.</li>
<li><i>Kashrut</i> has procedures by which equipment can be cleaned of its previous non-kosher use, but that might be inadequate for vegetarians or other religions. For example, dairy manufacturing equipment can be cleaned well enough that the rabbis will grant <i>pareve</i> status to products manufactured afterward. Nevertheless, someone with a strong allergic sensitivity to dairy products might still react to the dairy residue, and that is why some products will have a "milk" warning on a product which is legitimately <i>pareve</i>.</li>

<p><a href="/wiki/Genesis.html" title="Genesis">Genesis</a> 1:29 states "And <a href="/wiki/God.html" title="God">God</a> said: Behold, I have given you every herb yielding seed which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree that has seed-yielding fruit - to you it shall be for food." According to many classical Jewish Bible commentators, this means that God's original plan was for mankind to be vegetarian, and that God later gave permission for man to eat meat because of man's weak nature. However, others argue that people may eat animals because God gave Eve and Adam dominion over them. Some prominent <a href="/wiki/Rabbi.html" title="Rabbi">rabbis</a> have been vegetarian, among them former Chief Rabbi of <a href="/wiki/Israel.html" title="Israel">Israel</a> <a href="/wiki/Shlomo_Goren.html" title="Shlomo Goren">Shlomo Goren</a> and former Chief Rabbi of <a href="/wiki/Haifa.html" title="Haifa">Haifa</a> She'ar-Yashuv Cohen. <a href="/wiki/Abraham_Isaac_Kook.html" title="Abraham Isaac Kook">Abraham Isaac Kook</a>, the first Chief Rabbi of pre-state <a href="/wiki/Israel.html" title="Israel">Israel</a>, supported vegetarianism, and is often described as a vegetarian, though he ate a small amount of chicken every <a href="/wiki/Sabbath.html" title="Sabbath">Sabbath</a>.<a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/ravkook_veg.html">[3]</a>.</p>
<p>Some Orthodox authorities have ruled that it is forbidden for an individual to become a vegetarian if they do so because they believe in <a href="/wiki/Animal_rights.html" title="Animal rights">animal rights</a>; however, they have also ruled that vegetarianism is allowed for pragmatic reasons (if kosher meat is expensive or hard to come by in their area), health concerns, or for reasons of personal taste (if someone finds meat unpalatable). Some feel that the mass-slaughter of animals in this industrial age is not subject to the same scrutiny as it was in olden days, with the result that the likelihood of proper <i>shechita</i> is very low; some Jews abstain from meat for this reason. Some believe that <i><a href="/wiki/Halakha.html" title="Halakha">Halakha</a></i> encourages the eating of meat at the <a href="/wiki/Sabbath.html" title="Sabbath">Sabbath</a> and <a href="/wiki/Jewish_holiday.html" title="Jewish holiday">Festival</a> meals, and some Orthodox Jews who are otherwise vegetarian will nevertheless consume meat at these meals.</p>
<p>Kabbalistic teachings, from Talmudic and Medieval sources, restrict the consumption of meat to only those who are spiritually highly developed. The soul of an animal is more complex than that of a vegetable, so it requires a correspondingly complex soul to consume it. Conversely, others suggest that all Jews <i>except</i> the spiritually highly developed can eat meat: the consumption of meat has often been seen as luxuriously indulgent, and therefore the highly spiritual would abstain from it as a form of self-denial.</p>

<h2>Kashrut and animal welfare</h2>
<p>The practice of kosher slaughter emphasizes the sharpness of the knife and the accuracy and precision of the skill of the <i><a href="/wiki/Shechita.html" title="Shechita">shochet</a></i>, in order to slit the <a href="/wiki/Jugular_vein.html" title="Jugular vein">jugular</a> of the animal with an absolute minimum of pain and suffering. In general, over the years authorities have ruled that any unnecessary suffering by the animal can render otherwise kosher meat <i>traife</i>. Nevertheless, the method of slaughter used in strict adherence to Jewish law has been criticized as being inhumane by a number of animal rights organizations, in particular because animals are killed without the use of <a href="/wiki/Anesthesia.html" title="Anesthesia">anesthesia</a> (traditional <i>kashrut</i> would often not allow for anesthesia, as it may severely injure the animal before it is slaughtered, rendering it <i>Treifa</i>, and because <i>Kashrut</i> prohibits slaughter of an unconscious animal.) This has resulted in several restrictions or even an outright ban on kosher meat in a number of countries, sometimes encompassing related practices such as <a href="/wiki/Muslim.html" title="Muslim">Muslim</a> <i><a href="/wiki/Halal.html" title="Halal">halal</a></i> slaughter, though other countries grant ritualistic slaughter such as <i>kashrut</i> special exemption from the relevant regulations.</p>

<p>While Kashrut law requires consideration of animal welfare, it is sometimes not followed in practice, even under supposedly strict rabbinical supervision. In one of the most egregious cases, an investigation by <a href="/wiki/PETA.html" title="PETA">PETA</a> has revealed that “AgriProcessors, the world's largest glatt kosher slaughterhouse, has been ignoring the Jewish commitment to compassion and federal law by mutilating fully conscious animals, shocking them in the face, and slaughtering them in a way that has allowed many to stand and attempt to flee, even minutes after their throats had been slit.” <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.goveg.com/feat/agriprocessors/">[4]</a>. This was done under the supervision of the <a href="/wiki/Orthodox_Union.html" title="Orthodox Union">Orthodox Union</a>, an authority on strict adherence to kashrut laws.</p>
<p>Some <a href="/wiki/Animal_rights.html" title="Animal rights">animal rights</a> groups object to some forms of kosher slaughter, claiming it can take several minutes for the animal to die and can often cause immense suffering. Jewish groups point to studies showing that the technique is no more painful than conventional techniques, and in most cases quicker and less painful; the emphasis on flawless procedure and tools contrasts with the often sloppy production line methodology of the slaughterhouse resulting in failure to stun the animal, as often described by animal rights advocates in other contexts. However, the conclusions of these studies are sometimes rejected by animal rights advocates. In addition, there are campaigns to have the practice of ritualistic slaughter globally banned.</p>
<p>In some ways, modern slaughtering practices and <i>kashrut</i> practices clash, although both may have good intentions with respect to hygiene and animal welfare; for instance, <i>kashrut</i> prohibits slaughter of an unconscious animal, for reasons of avoiding consumption of a diseased animal as well as the possibility of inhumane means of anesthesia, and relies on the skill of the <i>shochet</i> and the sharpness of the knife to slit the jugular as painlessly as possible. On the other hand, for reasons of hygiene, modern slaughterhouse regulations prohibit the carcass of an animal from falling into the blood of another, so that animals are often suspended by a leg before being slaughtered; they would normally be stunned by a blow to the head to prevent suffering in this process, but the prohibition of slaughter of an unconscious animal prevents this for kosher slaughter. Of course, other methods of supporting the carcass of the animal after it is slaughtered are available, but since they are more expensive and not routinely used for non-kosher slaughter, slaughterhouses are reluctant to adopt them, and when they do often greatly raise the price of the meat to compensate for the non-standard technique.</p>
