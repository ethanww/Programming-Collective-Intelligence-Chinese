<p><a name="Fair_use_under_United_States_law" id="Fair_use_under_United_States_law"></a></p>
<h2>Fair use under United States law</h2>
<p>The legal concept of "copyright" was first ratified by the <a href="/wiki/Kingdom_of_Great_Britain.html" title="Kingdom of Great Britain">United Kingdom</a>'s <a href="/wiki/Statute_of_Anne.html" title="Statute of Anne">Statute of Anne</a> of <a href="/wiki/1709.html" title="1709">1709</a>. As room was not made for the authorized reproduction of copyrighted content within this newly formulated statutory right, the courts gradually created a doctrine of "fair abridgement", which later became "fair use", that recognized the utility of such actions. The doctrine only existed in the U.S. as <a href="/wiki/Common_law.html" title="Common law">common law</a> until it was incorporated into the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Copyright_Act_of_1976.html" title="United States Copyright Act of 1976">Copyright Act of 1976</a>, <span class="plainlinksneverexpand">17&#160;<a href="/wiki/United_States_Code.html" title="United States Code">U.S.C.</a>&#160;<a  class="external text" title="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/17/107.html">§&#160;107</a></span>, excerpted here:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 106 and 106A, the fair use of a copyrighted work, including such use by reproduction in copies or phonorecords or by any other means specified by that section, for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching (including multiple copies for classroom use), scholarship, or research, is not an infringement of copyright. In determining whether the use made of a work in any particular case is a fair use the factors to be considered shall include—</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ol>
<li>the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes;</li>
<li>the nature of the copyrighted work;</li>
<li>the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and</li>
<li>the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
</dl>
The fact that a work is unpublished shall not itself bar a finding of fair use if such finding is made upon consideration of all the above factors.<a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/17/107.html">[1]</a></blockquote>
<p>The four factors of analysis for fair use set forth above derive from the classic opinion of Justice Story in <i>Folsom v. Marsh</i>, <a href="/wiki/Case_citation.html" title="Case citation">9 F.Cas. 342</a> (<a href="/wiki/1841.html" title="1841">1841</a>), in which the defendant had copied 353 pages from the plaintiff's 12-volume biography of <a href="/wiki/George_Washington.html" title="George Washington">George Washington</a> in order to produce a separate two-volume work of his own. The court rejected the defendant's fair use defense with the following explanation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[A] reviewer may fairly cite largely from the original work, if his design be really and truly to use the passages for the purposes of fair and reasonable criticism. On the other hand, it is as clear, that if he thus cites the most important parts of the work, with a view, not to criticise, but to supersede the use of the original work, and substitute the review for it, such a use will be deemed in law a piracy... In short, we must often... look to the nature and objects of the selections made, the quantity and value of the materials used, and the degree in which the use may prejudice the sale, or diminish the profits, or supersede the objects, of the original work.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is important to note that once these factors were codified as guidelines in USC § 107, they were not rendered exclusive. The section was intended by Congress to restate, but not replace, the prior judge-made law. Courts are still entitled to consider other factors as well.</p>
<p>Fair use tempers copyright's exclusive rights to serve the purpose of copyright law, which the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Constitution.html" title="United States Constitution">U.S. Constitution</a> defines as the promotion of "the Progress of Science and useful Arts" (I.1.8). Some commentators have also suggested that the <a href="/wiki/First_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution.html" title="First Amendment to the United States Constitution">First Amendment</a>'s protection of <a href="/wiki/Free_speech.html" title="Free speech">free speech</a> necessitates some form of fair use defense, because some things simply cannot be said without some amount of copying. This principle applies particularly well to the case of criticism and also sheds light on various other limitations on copyright's exclusive rights, particularly the <i><a href="/wiki/Scenes_a_faire.html" title="Scenes a faire">scenes a faire</a></i> doctrine.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Purpose and character">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Purpose_and_character" id="Purpose_and_character"></a></p>
<h3>Purpose and character</h3>
<p>The first factor questions whether the use under consideration helps fulfill the intention of copyright law to stimulate creativity for the enrichment of the general public, or whether it aims to only "supersede the objects" of the original for reasons of, say, personal profit. In order to justify the use as fair, one must demonstrate how it either advances knowledge or the progress of the arts through the addition of something new. A key consideration is the extent to which the use is interpreted as <i>transformative</i>, as opposed to merely <i>derivative</i>. When <a  class="new" title="Tom Forsythe">Tom Forsythe</a> appropriated <a href="/wiki/Barbie.html" title="Barbie">Barbie</a> dolls for his photography project "Food Chain Barbie", <a href="/wiki/Mattel.html" title="Mattel">Mattel</a> lost its claims of copyright and trademark infringement against him because his work effectively <a href="/wiki/Parody.html" title="Parody">parodies</a> Barbie and the values she represents (cf. the 2003 9th Circuit case <i>Mattel Inc. v. Walking Mountain Productions</i>). However, when <a href="/wiki/Jeff_Koons.html" title="Jeff Koons">Jeff Koons</a> tried to justify his appropriation of Art Rogers' photograph "Puppies" in his sculpture "String of Puppies" with the same parody defense, he lost because his work was not presented as a parody of Rogers' photograph in particular, but of society at large, which was deemed insufficiently justificatory (see <i><a href="/wiki/Rogers_v._Koons.html" title="Rogers v. Koons">Art Rogers v. Jeff Koons</a></i>, 960 F.2d 301). Thus, even if a secondary work proves transformative, it must be appropriately so.</p>
<p>The subfactor mentioned in the legislation above, "whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes," has recently been deemphasized in some Circuits "since many, if not most, secondary uses seek at least some measure of commercial gain from their use" (<i>American Geophysical Union</i>, <a href="/wiki/Case_citation.html" title="Case citation">60 F.3d at 921</a>). More important is whether the use fulfills any of the "preamble purposes" also mentioned in the legislation above, as these have been interpreted as paradigmatically "transformative". Although Judge Pierre Leval has distinguished the first factor as "the soul of fair use," it alone is not determinative. For example, not every educational usage is fair (see the 1914 case, <i><a href="/wiki/Macmillan_Co._v._King.html" title="Macmillan Co. v. King">Macmillan Co. v. King</a></i>, although this case has only limited application since it was decided many years before the modern fair use provision became a part of the legislation).</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Nature of the copied work">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Nature_of_the_copied_work" id="Nature_of_the_copied_work"></a></p>
<h3>Nature of the copied work</h3>
<p>Although the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Supreme_Court.html" title="United States Supreme Court">United States Supreme Court</a> has ruled that the availability of copyright protection should not depend on the artistic quality or merit of the work at issue, fair use analyses nevertheless consider certain aspects of the copied work, such as whether it is fictional or non-fictional, to be germane. In order to prevent the private ownership of work that rightfully belongs in the public domain, <a href="/wiki/Idea-expression_divide.html" title="Idea-expression divide">facts and ideas are separate from copyright</a>—only their particular expression or fixation merits such protection. On the other hand, the social usefulness of freely available information can weigh against the appropriateness of copyright for certain fixations. The <a href="/wiki/Zapruder_film.html" title="Zapruder film">Zapruder film</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Assassination_of_President_Kennedy.html" title="Assassination of President Kennedy">assassination of President Kennedy</a>, for example, was purchased and copyrighted by <i>Time</i> magazine. Yet their copyright was not upheld, in the name of the public interest, when they tried to enjoin the reproduction of stills from the film in a history book on the subject in <i><a  class="new" title="Time Inc. v. Bernard Geis Associates">Time Inc. v. Bernard Geis Associates</a></i>, <a href="/wiki/Case_citation.html" title="Case citation">293 F. Supp. 130</a>.</p>
<p>Following the decisions of the Second Circuit in <i>Salinger v. Random House, Inc.</i>, <a href="/wiki/Case_citation.html" title="Case citation">650 F. Supp. 413</a> (<a href="/wiki/S.D.N.Y..html" title="S.D.N.Y.">S.D.N.Y.</a> <a href="/wiki/1986.html" title="1986">1986</a>), and in <i>New Era Publications Int'l v. Henry Holt &amp; Co.</i>, <a href="/wiki/Case_citation.html" title="Case citation">695 F. Supp. 1493</a> (<a href="/wiki/S.D.N.Y..html" title="S.D.N.Y.">S.D.N.Y.</a> <a href="/wiki/1988.html" title="1988">1988</a>), whether the copied work has been previously published suddenly trumped all other considerations because of, in the words of one commentator, "the original author's interest in controlling the circumstances of the first public revelation of his work, and his right, if he so chooses, not to publish at all." Yet some view this importation of certain aspects of France's <i>droit moral d'artiste</i> into American copyright law as "bizarre and contradictory" because it sometimes grants greater protection to works that were created for private purposes that have little to do with the public goals of copyright law, than to those works that copyright was initially conceived to protect. This is not to claim that unpublished works, or, more specifically, works not intended for publication, do not deserve legal protection, but that any such protection should come from laws about privacy, rather than from laws about copyright. The statutory fair use provision was amended in response to these concerns by adding a final sentence: "The fact that a work is unpublished shall not itself bar a finding of fair use if such finding is made upon consideration of all the above factors."</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Amount and substantiality">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Amount_and_substantiality" id="Amount_and_substantiality"></a></p>
<h3>Amount and substantiality</h3>
<p>The third factor assesses the quantity or percentage of the original copyrighted work that has been imported into the new work. In general, the less that is used in relation to the whole, e.g., a few sentences of a text for a book review, the more likely that the sample will be considered fair use. Yet see <i><a href="/wiki/Sony_Corp._of_America_v._Universal_City_Studios%2C_Inc..html" title="Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc.">Sony Corp. v. Universal City Studios</a></i> for a case in which substantial copying — entire programs for private viewing — was upheld as fair use. Conversely, in <i><a href="/wiki/Harper_%26_Row%2C_Publishers%2C_Inc._v._Nation_Enters..html" title="Harper &amp; Row, Publishers, Inc. v. Nation Enters.">Harper &amp; Row, Publishers, Inc. v. Nation Enters.</a></i>, <a href="/wiki/Case_citation.html" title="Case citation">471 U.S. 539</a> (<a href="/wiki/1985.html" title="1985">1985</a>), the use of less than 400 words from <a href="/wiki/Gerald_Ford.html" title="Gerald Ford">President Ford</a>'s memoir by a political opinion magazine was interpreted as infringement because those few words represented "the heart of the book" and were, as such, substantial.</p>
<p>Prior to <a href="/wiki/1991.html" title="1991">1991</a>, <a href="/wiki/Sampling_%28music%29.html" title="Sampling (music)">sampling</a> in certain genres of music was accepted practice and such copyright considerations as these were viewed as largely irrelevant. The infamously strict decision against <a href="/wiki/Hip_hop_music.html" title="Hip hop music">rapper</a> <a href="/wiki/Biz_Markie.html" title="Biz Markie">Biz Markie</a>'s appropriation of a <a href="/wiki/Gilbert_O%27Sullivan.html" title="Gilbert O'Sullivan">Gilbert O'Sullivan</a> song in the case <i><a href="/wiki/Grand_Upright_v._Warner.html" title="Grand Upright v. Warner">Grand Upright v. Warner</a></i>, <a href="/wiki/Case_citation.html" title="Case citation">780 F. Supp. 182</a> (<a href="/wiki/S.D.N.Y..html" title="S.D.N.Y.">S.D.N.Y.</a> 1991), changed practices and opinions overnight. Samples now had to be licensed, so long as they rose "to a level of legally cognizable appropriation" (see <i><a  class="new" title="Bridgeport Music Inc. v. Dimension Films">Bridgeport Music Inc. v. Dimension Films</a></i>, <a href="/wiki/Case_citation.html" title="Case citation">230 F. Supp.2d at 841</a> <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://fsnews.findlaw.com/cases/6th/04a0297p.html">[2]</a>). In other words, <i>de minimis</i> sampling was still considered fair and free because, traditionally, "the law does not care about trifles." The recent Sixth Circuit Court decision in the appeal to <i>Bridgeport Music</i> has reversed this standing. The new rule in that Circuit is even more strict in its rendering of copyright law: "get a license or do not sample." Fair use does not come into play at all.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Effect upon work's value">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Effect_upon_work.27s_value" id="Effect_upon_work.27s_value"></a></p>
<h3>Effect upon work's value</h3>
<p>The fourth factor measures the effect that the allegedly infringing use has had on the copyright owner's ability to exploit his original work. The court not only investigates whether the defendant's specific use of the work has significantly harmed the copyright owner's market, but also whether such uses in general, if widespread, would harm the potential market of the original. The burden of proof here rests on the defendant for commercial uses, but on the copyright owner for noncommercial uses. See <i><a href="/wiki/Sony_Corp._v._Universal_City_Studios.html" title="Sony Corp. v. Universal City Studios">Sony Corp. v. Universal City Studios</a></i>, <a href="/wiki/Case_citation.html" title="Case citation">464 U.S. 417, 451</a> (<a href="/wiki/1984.html" title="1984">1984</a>), where the copyright owner, <a href="/wiki/Universal_Studios.html" title="Universal Studios">Universal</a>, failed to provide any empirical evidence that the use of <a href="/wiki/Betamax.html" title="Betamax">Betamax</a> had either reduced their viewership or negatively impacted their business. In the aforementioned <i>Nation</i> case regarding President Ford's memoirs, the Supreme Court labelled this factor "the single most important element of fair use" (471 U.S. at 566) and it has indeed enjoyed some level of primacy in fair use analyses ever since. Yet the Supreme Court's more recent announcement in <i><a href="/wiki/Campbell_v._Acuff-Rose_Music%2C_Inc..html" title="Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc.">Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc.</a></i>, <a href="/wiki/Case_citation.html" title="Case citation">510 U.S. at 578</a> (<a href="/wiki/1994.html" title="1994">1994</a>), that "all [four factors] are to be explored, and the results weighed together, in light of the purposes of copyright" has helped modulate this emphasis in interpretation.</p>
<p>In evaluating the fourth factor, courts often consider two kinds of harm to the potential market of the original work. First, courts consider whether the use in question acts as a direct market substitute for the original work. In the words of the Supreme Court in <i>Acuff-Rose Music</i>, "when a commercial use amounts to mere duplication of the entirety of the original, it clearly supersedes the object of the original and serves as a market replacement for it, making it likely that cognizable market harm to the original will occur." In one instance, a court ruled that this factor weighed against a defendant who had made unauthorized movie trailers for video retailers, since his trailers acted as direct substitutes for the copyright owner's official trailers. See <i><a  class="new" title="Video Pipeline v. Buena Vista">Video Pipeline v. Buena Vista</a></i>, <a href="/wiki/Case_citation.html" title="Case citation">342 F.3d 191</a> (<a href="/wiki/3d_Cir..html" title="3d Cir.">3d Cir.</a> <a href="/wiki/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a>). On the other hand, one might well question whether <a href="/wiki/Roland_Barthes.html" title="Roland Barthes">Roland Barthes</a>' <i>S/Z</i> clearly supersedes <a href="/wiki/Honor%C3%A9_de_Balzac.html" title="Honoré de Balzac">Honoré de Balzac</a>'s short story "Sarrasine" as a market replacement, since it reproduces the entirety of the latter, though only in short fragments followed by much critical explication by Barthes. Second, courts also consider whether potential market harm might exist beyond that of direct substitution, such as in the potential existence of a licensing market. This consideration has weighed against commercial copy shops that make copies of articles in course-packs for college students, when a market already existed for the licensing of course-pack copies. See <i><a  class="new" title="Princeton Univ. Press v. Michigan Document Services">Princeton Univ. Press v. Michigan Document Services</a></i>, <a href="/wiki/Case_citation.html" title="Case citation">99 F.3d 1381</a> (<a href="/wiki/6th_Cir..html" title="6th Cir.">6th Cir.</a> 1999).</p>
<p>It is important to note that courts recognize that certain kinds of market harm do not oppose fair use, such as when a parody or negative review impairs the market of the original work. Fair use considerations may not shield a work against adverse criticism.</p>

<h2>Practical effect of fair use defense</h2>
<p>The practical effect of this law and the court decisions following it is that it is usually possible to quote from a copyrighted work in order to criticize or comment upon it, teach students about it, and possibly for other uses. Certain well-established uses cause few problems. A teacher who prints a few copies of a poem to illustrate a technique will have no problem on all four of the above factors (except possibly on amount and substantiality), but some cases are not so clear. All the factors are considered and balanced in each case: a book reviewer who quotes a paragraph as an example of the author's style will probably fall under fair use even though he may sell his review commercially. But a non-profit educational website that reproduces whole articles from technical magazines will probably be found to infringe if the publisher can demonstrate that the website affects the market for the magazine, even though the website itself is non-commercial.</p>

<h2>Fair use as a defense</h2>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States.html" title="Supreme Court of the United States">Supreme Court of the United States</a> ruled in <i><a href="/wiki/Campbell_v._Acuff-Rose_Music%2C_Inc..html" title="Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc.">Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc.</a></i>, 510 U.S. 569 (1994), that fair use is an <a href="/wiki/Affirmative_defense.html" title="Affirmative defense">affirmative defense</a> to copyright infringement. This means that if the defendant's actions do not constitute an infringement of the plaintiff's rights (for example, because the plaintiff's work was not copyrighted, or the defendant's work did not borrow from it sufficiently), fair use does not even arise as an issue. However, it also means that, once the plaintiff has proven (or the defendant concedes) that the defendant has committed an infringing act, the defendant then bears the <a href="/wiki/Burden_of_proof.html" title="Burden of proof">burden of proving</a> in court that his copying should nonetheless be excused as a fair use of the plaintiff's work.</p>
<p>Because of the defendant's burden of proof, some copyright owners frequently make claims of infringement even in circumstances where the fair use defense would likely succeed in hopes that the user will refrain from the use rather than spending resources in his defense. This type of frivolous lawsuit is part of a much larger problem in First Amendment law; see <i><a href="/wiki/Strategic_lawsuit_against_public_participation.html" title="Strategic lawsuit against public participation">Strategic lawsuit against public participation</a></i>.</p>
<p>Because paying a royalty fee may be much less expensive than having a potential copyright suit threaten the publication of a completed work in which a publisher has invested significant resources, many authors may seek a license even for uses that copyright law ostensibly permits without liability.</p>

<h2>Fair use and parody</h2>
<p>Producers or creators of <a href="/wiki/Parody.html" title="Parody">parodies</a> of a copyrighted work have been sued for infringement by the targets of their ridicule, even though such use may be protected as fair use. The fair use cases addressing parodies distinguish between parodies — using a work in order to poke fun at or comment on the work itself — and satires — using a work to poke fun at or comment on something else. Courts have been more willing to grant fair use protections to parodies than to satires, but the ultimate outcome in either circumstance will turn on the application of the four fair use factors.</p>
<p>In <i><a href="/wiki/Campbell_v._Acuff-Rose_Music%2C_Inc..html" title="Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc.">Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc.</a></i> (<a href="/wiki/1994.html" title="1994">1994</a>), the <a href="/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States.html" title="Supreme Court of the United States">Supreme Court</a> recognized parody as a fair use, even when done for profit. <a href="/wiki/Roy_Orbison.html" title="Roy Orbison">Roy Orbison</a>'s publisher, <a  class="new" title="Acuff-Rose Music Inc.">Acuff-Rose Music Inc.</a>, had sued <a href="/wiki/2_Live_Crew.html" title="2 Live Crew">2 Live Crew</a> in <a href="/wiki/1989.html" title="1989">1989</a> for their use of Orbison's "<a href="/wiki/Oh%2C_Pretty_Woman.html" title="Oh, Pretty Woman">Oh, Pretty Woman</a>" in a mocking rap version with altered lyrics. The Supreme Court viewed 2 Live Crew's version as a ridiculing commentary on the earlier work, and ruled that when the parody was itself the product rather than used for mere advertising, commercial sale did not bar the defense. The <i>Campbell</i> court also distinguished parodies from <a href="/wiki/Satire.html" title="Satire">satire</a>, which they described as a broader social critique not intrinsically tied to ridicule of a specific work, and so not deserving of the same use exceptions as parody because the satirist's ideas are capable of expression without the use of the other particular work.</p>
<p>In a more recent parody case, <i><a href="/wiki/Suntrust_v._Houghton_Mifflin.html" title="Suntrust v. Houghton Mifflin">Suntrust v. Houghton Mifflin</a></i>, a suit was brought unsuccessfully against the publication of <i><a href="/wiki/The_Wind_Done_Gone.html" title="The Wind Done Gone">The Wind Done Gone</a></i>, which reused many of the characters and situations from <i><a href="/wiki/Gone_with_the_Wind.html" title="Gone with the Wind">Gone with the Wind</a></i>, but told the events from the point of view of the slaves rather than the slaveholders. The <a href="/wiki/United_States_Court_of_Appeals_for_the_Eleventh_Circuit.html" title="United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit">Eleventh Circuit</a>, applying <i>Campbell</i>, recognized that <i>The Wind Done Gone</i> was a protected parody, and vacated the <a href="/wiki/U.S._District_Court_for_the_Northern_District_of_Georgia.html" title="U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia">district court's</a> injunction against its publication.</p>

<h2>Fair use on the Internet</h2>
<p>A recent court case, <i><a href="/wiki/Kelly_v._Arriba_Soft_Corporation.html" title="Kelly v. Arriba Soft Corporation">Kelly v. Arriba Soft Corporation</a>,</i> provides and develops the relationship between <a href="/wiki/Thumbnail.html" title="Thumbnail">thumbnails</a>, <a href="/wiki/Inline_linking.html" title="Inline linking">inline linking</a> and fair use. In the lower District Court case on a motion for <a href="/wiki/Summary_judgment.html" title="Summary judgment">summary judgment</a>, Arriba Soft was found to have violated copyright without a fair use defense in the use of thumbnail pictures and inline linking from Kelly's website in Arriba's image <a href="/wiki/Search_engine.html" title="Search engine">search engine</a>. That decision was appealed and contested by Internet rights activists such as the <a href="/wiki/Electronic_Frontier_Foundation.html" title="Electronic Frontier Foundation">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a>, who argued that it is clearly covered under fair use. On appeal, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals found that the thumbnails were fair use and remanded the case to the lower court for trial after issuing a revised opinion on <a href="/wiki/July_7.html" title="July 7">July 7</a>, <a href="/wiki/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a>. The remaining issues were resolved with a default judgement after Arriba Soft had experienced significant financial problems and failed to reach a negotiated settlement.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Common misunderstandings">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Common_misunderstandings" id="Common_misunderstandings"></a></p>
<h2>Common misunderstandings</h2>
<p>Because of the deliberate ambiguity of fair use, it is commonly misunderstood. Here are some of the more common misunderstandings with explanations of why they are wrong:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>It's copyrighted, so it can't be fair use</i>. Fair use describes conditions under which copyrighted material may be used without permission. If a work is not copyrighted, it's in the public domain and can legally be used without regard to fair use law.</li>
<li><i>Acknowledgement of the source makes a use fair</i>. Giving the name of the photographer or author may help, but it is not sufficient on its own. Note that <a href="/wiki/Plagiarism.html" title="Plagiarism">plagiarism</a> is a matter of professional ethics, not of copyright — copyright law protects exact expression, <i>not</i> ideas, and so while citing the source for an idea prevents plagiarism, it is not necessarily needed to avoid infringing copyright if exact words are not used. On the other hand, one can plagiarize a work that is not protected by copyright.</li>
<li><i>Noncommercial use is invariably fair</i>. Not true, though a judge may take the profit motive or lack thereof into account.</li>
<li><i>The lack of a copyright notice means the work is public domain</i>. Not <i>always</i> true. United States law in effect since <a href="/wiki/March_1.html" title="March 1">March 1</a>, <a href="/wiki/1989.html" title="1989">1989</a> has made copyright the default for newly created works. For works produced between <a href="/wiki/January_1.html" title="January 1">January 1</a>, <a href="/wiki/1923.html" title="1923">1923</a> and <a href="/wiki/March_1.html" title="March 1">March 1</a>, <a href="/wiki/1989.html" title="1989">1989</a>, copyright notice is required; however, registration was not required <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ1.html#pub">[3]</a> and between <a href="/wiki/January_1.html" title="January 1">January 1</a>, <a href="/wiki/1978.html" title="1978">1978</a> and <a href="/wiki/March_1.html" title="March 1">March 1</a>, <a href="/wiki/1989.html" title="1989">1989</a> lack of notice is not necessarily determinative, if attempts were made immediately to correct the lack of notice. Any American works that did not have formal registration or notice fell into the Public Domain if registration was not made in a timely fashion. For international works, the situation is even more complex. International authors who failed to provide copyright notice or register with the U.S. copyright office are given additional contemporary remedies which may restore American copyright protection given certain conditions. International authors/corporations who fail to meet these remedies forfeit their copyright. An example of a company who failed to prove copyright was <a href="/wiki/Roland_Corporation.html" title="Roland Corporation">Roland Corporation</a> and their claimed copyright on the sounds contained in their <a href="/wiki/MT-32.html" title="MT-32">MT-32</a> synthesizer.</li>
<li><i>It's okay to quote up to 300 words</i>. The 300-word limit is reported to be an unofficial agreement, now long obsolete, among permissions editors in the New York publishing houses: 'I'll let you copy 300 words from our books if you let us copy 300 words from yours.' It runs counter to the substantiality standard. As explained above, the substantiality of the copying is more important than the actual amount. For instance, copying a complete short poem is more substantial than copying a random paragraph of a novel; copying an 8.5x11-inch photo is more substantial than copying a square foot of an 8x10-foot painting. In 1985, the U.S. Supreme Court held that a news article's quotation of approximately 300 words from former President Gerald Ford's 200,000 word memoir was sufficient to constitute an infringement of the exclusive publication right in the work. (Harper &amp; Row, Publishers, Inc. v. Nation Enterprises, 105 S.Ct. 2218 (1985).</li>

<p><a name="Fair_use_and_trademark_law" id="Fair_use_and_trademark_law"></a></p>
<h2>Fair use and trademark law</h2>
<p>In the United States, there is also a fair use defense in <a href="/wiki/Trademark.html" title="Trademark">trademark</a> law based on similar principles as the doctrine under copyright, such as free speech, but with different exceptions. Fair use is consistent with the more limited protection granted to trademarks, generally specific only to the particular product market and geographic area of the trademark owner.</p>
<p>Most trademarks are adopted from words or symbols already common to the culture, as <a href="/wiki/Apple_Computer.html" title="Apple Computer">Apple Computer</a> is from <a href="/wiki/Apple.html" title="Apple">apple</a>, instead of being invented by the mark owner (such as <a href="/wiki/Kodak.html" title="Kodak">Kodak</a>). Courts have recognized that ownership in the mark cannot prevent others from using the word or symbol in these other senses, such as if the trademark is a descriptive word or common symbol such as a pine tree. This means that the less distinctive or original the trademark, the less able the trademark owner will be to control how it is used.</p>
<p>A nonowner may also <a href="/wiki/Nominative_use.html" title="Nominative use">use a trademark <i>nominatively</i></a>—to refer to the actual trademarked product or its source. In addition to protecting product criticism and analysis, United States law actually encourages nominative usage by competitors in the form of comparative advertising.</p>
<p>The fair use defense in trademark law is not precluded by the possibility of confusion, according to the Supreme Court in 2003 (<a  class="new" title="KP Permanent Makeup">KP Permanent Makeup</a>). However, courts may consider the possibility of confusion in analyzing whether a use is fair or not. Intent to sow confusion is also relevant; hence, the general rule that no more of the trademark should be used than necessary for the legitimate purpose. For instance, use of a word mark is preferred to a logo, and a word mark in the same style of type as surrounding text is preferred to a word mark in its trademarked distinctive type.</p>
