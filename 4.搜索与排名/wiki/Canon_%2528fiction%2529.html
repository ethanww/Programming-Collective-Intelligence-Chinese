<p>In the context of fiction, the <b>canon</b> of a <a href="/wiki/Fictional_universe.html" title="Fictional universe">fictional universe</a> comprises those novels, stories, films, etc. that are considered to be genuine (or "official"), and those events, characters, settings, etc. that are considered to have inarguable existence within the fictional universe. Usually items that are considered canon come from the original source of the fictional universe while <b>non-canon</b> material comes from adaptations or unofficial items. Generally, <a href="/wiki/Expanded_Universe.html" title="Expanded Universe">Expanded Universes</a> are not considered canon, though there are exceptions which are considered <b>near-canon</b>, or in the case of <i><a href="/wiki/Star_Wars.html" title="Star Wars">Star Wars</a></i>, the Expanded Universe is considered <b>full canon</b>. By analogy with the idea of a canon of <a href="/wiki/Scripture.html" title="Scripture">Scripture</a>, things which are not canon are considered "<a href="/wiki/Apocrypha_%28fiction%29.html" title="Apocrypha (fiction)">apocryphal</a>". See <a href="/wiki/Biblical_canon.html" title="Biblical canon">Biblical canon</a>. In <a href="/wiki/Layman.html" title="Layman">layman</a>'s terms, one could basically say that something that is canon is something that "actually happened" in that universe.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Fan_fiction.html" title="Fan fiction">Fan fiction</a> <i><b>was</b></i> never considered canon, until the precendent-shattering advent of the <a href="/wiki/1632_series.html" title="1632 series">1632 Universe</a> in February&#160;<a href="/wiki/2000.html" title="2000">2000</a> by <a href="/wiki/Eric_Flint.html" title="Eric Flint">Eric Flint</a>, wherein fans and other established authors were invited on the internet forum <a href="/wiki/Baen%27s_Bar.html" title="Baen's Bar">Baen's Bar</a> to shape the <a href="/wiki/Parallel_universe_%28fiction%29.html" title="Parallel universe (fiction)">multiverse</a> and the fan-fic once vetted is itself published in the various <i><a href="/wiki/The_Grantville_Gazette.html" title="The Grantville Gazette">Grantville Gazettes</a></i>, themselves under the direct editorial control of Flint and an <a href="/wiki/1632_editorial_board.html" title="1632 editorial board">1632 editorial board</a>. This is an ongoing process that apparently will continue indefinitely as the series continues to burgeon in popularity.</p>
<p>Sometimes, however, events or characterizations portrayed in fan fiction can become so influential that they are respected in fiction written by many different authors, and may be mistaken for canonical facts by fans. This is referred to as "<a href="/wiki/Fanon_%28fiction%29.html" title="Fanon (fiction)">fanon</a>". The use of fan fiction to fill gaps or continuity errors in canon is derisively called "fanwanking," or "<a href="/wiki/Fanwank.html" title="Fanwank">fanwank</a>". (The terms fanon and fanwank can apply to officially licensed works as well.)</p>
<p>Canonicity of fiction is a distinctly modern idea, since earlier ages, before the current ideas of <a href="/wiki/Intellectual_property.html" title="Intellectual property">intellectual property</a> (IP) came about, did not distinguish between "official" and "unofficial" sources of stories. However, whereas IP laws are designed to dictate where the revenue generated by a story goes, they do not necessarily confer the right to determine canonicity.</p>
<p>A great deal of the interest and controversy over canonicity comes from the Star Wars franchise, because of the unique-for-its-time goal of derivative works such as Star Wars books to be completely in continuity with each other and with the Star Wars movies.</p>

<h2>Examples of fictional canons</h2>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Alien">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Alien" id="Alien"></a></p>
<h3><a href="/wiki/Alien.html" title="Alien">Alien</a></h3>
<p>What is considered to be canon in this Universe are the movies, their scripts, the novelizations (not to be confused with the <a href="/wiki/Dark_Horse.html" title="Dark Horse">Dark Horse</a> novels), some information from the DVD supplements (take with a grain of salt: writers have some priority over director's comments) and magazine interviews. Since the comic books and the <a href="/wiki/Dark_Horse.html" title="Dark Horse">Dark Horse</a> novels contradict the events in the movies (and sometimes each other), they are not considered canon. Video games are also not canon for the same reason (whatever "information " that is "revealed" in them are to make them a bit more interesting; not to mention giving the players more difficult creatures to kill).</p>
<p>Some of the younger fans reject the novelizations as they feel that they cannot obtain any of them, as well as most of the information sources that were available when the first movie was released (which was before many of them were born). For this reason, they will readily accept the <a href="/wiki/Dark_Horse.html" title="Dark Horse">Dark Horse</a> novels and video games out of availability, but in addition to the shortcomings mentioned above, the writers of the books and games have no connections to the movies, whatsoever.</p>
<p>Although not all of the information found in the novelizations can be relied upon, there is a wealth of information can be found, as they were based on the most recent script drafts that were available. Not all of the information can be relied upon, but, conversely, none of it should be shunned. For example, the novelization states that the occupants of the derelict ship had discovered the alien eggs on the planet where the first two movies take place. In the second movie, the main character, Ripley, after hearing that there was no indigenous life on that planet, answers that the derelict ship had brought the eggs to that planet. This can be assumed in that she hadn't visited the ship and those who had did not check the ship's manifest to see if the eggs were on board before the ship had landed there.</p>
<p>To reconcile the two sides, it could very well be that the crew of the alien derelict had visited the planet many millennium ago, discovered the eggs of a dying race, stored them aboard their ship, were infected, and sent out a signal warning other ships to stay away. Time passes, the planet deteriorates further, leaving the only life available on that planet in the stasis field of the derelict ship.</p>
<p>Another contradiction that had been resolved is that the "Cocoon Scene" in <a href="/wiki/Alien.html" title="Alien">Alien</a>, where Ripley discovers her cocooned shipmates, Dallas and Kane. In this scene, she finds that Brett is being transformed into an alien egg with Dallas, having been cocooned, either waiting to become a host for the alien egg's larva (the face hugger) or was in the process of becoming an egg himself. Since this scene was excised for pacing issues, <a href="/wiki/James_Cameron.html" title="James Cameron">James Cameron</a> used its omission to create his "queen alien" concept. This method of reproduction would replace the old concept of an adult alien transforming its victims to eggs. However, to reconcile this, it has been suggested by many that if a lone adult alien should be operating on its own and there is no queen available, it would be able to reproduce by altering the genetic makeup of a host to make a new egg.</p>
<p>Another issue that has caused some confusion is the "Bishop II" character seen at the end of <a href="/wiki/Alien%5E3.html" title="Alien^3">Alien^3</a>. A few people were under the impression that he was an android. This could be written off simply as ignorance of basic medical knowledge and not doing simple research. The DVD commentary track (which features effects people Alec Gillis and Tom Woodruff, Jr. and "Bishop II" actor Lance Henriksen) has the afore mention people all declaring that the "Bishop II" character is human (not to mention that one of the effects people mentions how the director wanted everyone to know that "Bishop II" was human and that the script even points to his humanity). Years later, Lance Henriksen had reversed his statement in order to lend some continuity to the movie <a href="/wiki/Alien_Vs._Predator.html" title="Alien Vs. Predator">Alien Vs. Predator</a>. Unfortunately, since the witers and directors of <a href="/wiki/Alien_Vs._Predator.html" title="Alien Vs. Predator">Alien Vs. Predator</a> had nothing to do with the making of <a href="/wiki/Alien%5E3.html" title="Alien^3">Alien^3</a>, the character is still considered human as it was the movie where he was established.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Babylon 5">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Babylon_5" id="Babylon_5"></a></p>
<h3><a href="/wiki/Babylon_5.html" title="Babylon 5">Babylon 5</a></h3>
<p>The canon consists of the television series <i><a href="/wiki/Babylon_5.html" title="Babylon 5">Babylon 5</a></i> and its later TV movies, the TV series <i><a href="/wiki/Crusade_%28TV_series%29.html" title="Crusade (TV series)">Crusade</a></i>, novels published by <a href="/wiki/Random_House.html" title="Random House">Dell</a> and <a href="/wiki/Ballantine_Books.html" title="Ballantine Books">Del Rey/Ballantine</a>, various short stories, and the <i>Babylon 5</i> comic book published by <a href="/wiki/DC_Comics.html" title="DC Comics">DC Comics</a>. This was decided by <a href="/wiki/J._Michael_Straczynski.html" title="J. Michael Straczynski">J. Michael Straczynski</a>, who maintained a tight control on the expanded universe to ensure that nearly <b>everything</b> was canonical: going so far as to pen elaborate story-outlines hundreds of pages long for the novels' authors based upon his personal historical notes for the B5 universe, and in general seeking to safeguard the spin off works' reputations for being every bit as legitimate and sophisticated as the television series.</p>
<p>The <i>Babylon 5</i> novels have a number of major elements that are considered canon by series creator Straczynski. However, the later ones published by Del Rey are generally regarded as being <b>more</b> canonical than some of the early Dell books, which were published with less storyline oversight by Straczynski than he would later exercise.</p>
<p>The seventh and ninth Dell novels — <i><a  class="new" title="The Shadow Within">The Shadow Within</a></i> by <a  class="new" title="Jeanne Cavelos">Jeanne Cavelos</a> and <i><a href="/wiki/To_Dream_in_the_City_of_Sorrows.html" title="To Dream in the City of Sorrows">To Dream in the City of Sorrows</a></i> by <a href="/wiki/Kathryn_M._Drennan.html" title="Kathryn M. Drennan">Kathryn M. Drennan</a> — are the only two books from this run which are considered to be canonical in their entirety, whereas all of the Del Rey novels are fully endorsed by the series' creator, along with the DC comic books and short fiction.</p>
<p>In addition to all this, J. Michael Straczynski is himself (as of early 2006) putting the finishing touches on the manuscript for a 100-page <i>Babylon 5</i> graphic novel to be published by <a href="/wiki/Wildstorm_Productions.html" title="Wildstorm Productions">Wildstorm Productions</a> sometime in the middle to late period of the year. The premise, characters, and plot line of the book are as yet unknown.</p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/May_21.html" title="May 21">May 21</a>, <a href="/wiki/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>, in an internet post <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.jmsnews.com/msg.aspx?ID=1-17550">[1]</a>, J. Michael Straczynski explicitly declared a series of upcoming Babylon 5 novels from <a href="/wiki/Mongoose_Publishing.html" title="Mongoose Publishing">Mongoose Publishing</a> to be non-canonical. Mongoose Publishing had been advertising the novels as "100% Canon" and making them based on J. Michael Straczynski's notes and story outlines, but without his direct consultation. J. Michael Straczynski's reaction was to publicly state that the contents of those novels did not reflect the Babylon 5 universe as he viewed it, and were to him "licensed fan fiction".</p>

<h3><a href="/wiki/Beauty_and_the_Beast_%28series%29.html" title="Beauty and the Beast (series)">Beauty and the Beast</a></h3>
<p>Most fans of the <a href="/wiki/CBS.html" title="CBS">CBS</a> television series consider all episodes of the first season, and at least all Season 2 episodes through "The Hollow Men," to be canonical. Opinions diverge at this point, as the writing of the series took a much darker turn, in an attempt to increase the series' <a href="/wiki/Nielsen_ratings.html" title="Nielsen ratings">Nielsen ratings</a> beyond its narrow fan niche; and the final three Season 2 episodes, focusing on Vincent's madness, do not appeal to many fans, who focus on the romantic or literary aspects of the characters.</p>
<p>The sharpest divergence of opinion comes when Season 3 is considered. Fan groups divide into two camps, between those who accept or reject the death of <a href="/wiki/Beauty_and_the_Beast_%28series%29#Catherine_Chandler.html" title="Beauty and the Beast (series)">Catherine Chandler</a> and the introduction of <a href="/wiki/Beauty_and_the_Beast_%28series%29#Diana_Bennett.html" title="Beauty and the Beast (series)">Diana Bennett</a>. It has been noted by some that those who accept Season 3 as canonical usually refer to the series as <i>B&amp;B</i>, while the opposite side uses <i>BATB</i>. The opinion divided the fan community enough that an audience round table discussion on "Healing the Rift in Fandom" was organized at the 1991 <i>South of Oz</i> fan convention in <a href="/wiki/Orlando%2C_Florida.html" title="Orlando, Florida">Orlando</a>, <a href="/wiki/Florida.html" title="Florida">Florida</a>.</p>

<h4>DC Animated Universe</h4>

This "<a href="/wiki/DC_Animated_Universe.html" title="DC Animated Universe">DC Animated Universe</a>" includes <i><a  title="Batman: The Animated Series">Batman: The Animated Series</a></i>; <i><a href="/wiki/The_New_Batman_Adventures.html" title="The New Batman Adventures">The New Batman Adventures</a> (considered by most to be an extension of Batman: The Animated Series)</i>; <i><a  title="Superman: The Animated Series">Superman: The Animated Series</a></i>; <i><a href="/wiki/Batman_Beyond.html" title="Batman Beyond">Batman Beyond</a></i>; <i><a href="/wiki/The_Zeta_Project.html" title="The Zeta Project">The Zeta Project</a></i>; <i><a href="/wiki/Static_Shock.html" title="Static Shock">Static Shock</a></i>; <i><a href="/wiki/Justice_League_%28TV_series%29.html" title="Justice League (TV series)">Justice League</a></i>; and <i><a href="/wiki/Justice_League_Unlimited.html" title="Justice League Unlimited">Justice League Unlimited</a></i>, as well as the animated movies <i><a  title="Batman: Mask of the Phantasm">Batman: Mask of the Phantasm</a></i>; <i><a href="/wiki/World%27s_Finest.html" title="World's Finest">World's Finest</a></i>; <i><a  title="Batman &amp; Mr. Freeze: SubZero">Batman &amp; Mr. Freeze: SubZero</a></i>; <i><a  title="Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker">Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker</a></i>; and <i><a  title="Batman: Mystery of the Batwoman">Batman: Mystery of the Batwoman</a></i>.</p>
<p>As is typical with all secondary information sources, fans are divided upon whether to consider the various comic books based on the animated series part of the official canon. However, when the <i>Justice League</i> series contradicted the <i><a href="/wiki/Superman_Adventures.html" title="Superman Adventures">Superman Adventures</a></i> comic book (by showing the animated <a href="/wiki/Supergirl.html" title="Supergirl">Supergirl</a> as vulnerable to <a href="/wiki/Kryptonite.html" title="Kryptonite">Kryptonite</a>), <a href="/wiki/Dwayne_McDuffie.html" title="Dwayne McDuffie">Dwayne McDuffie</a> stated on Usenet "We don't follow the comic book continuity, even the "Adventures" line"<a  class="external autonumber" title="http://groups.google.co.uk/group/rec.arts.comics.dc.universe/msg/b049f648e6a81e14?hl=en&amp;">[2]</a>.</p>

<h3>Doctor Who</h3>
<p>There has never been an "official" statement on what is canonical <i><a href="/wiki/Doctor_Who.html" title="Doctor Who">Doctor Who</a></i>. <i>Doctor Who</i> has never had a single author or authority and it is apparent that the <a href="/wiki/BBC.html" title="BBC">BBC</a>, which owns the series, has generally not cared about the matter. The many creators of <i>Doctor Who</i> have always treated the concept of continuity loosely. Fans run a spectrum between those who consider only the television series canonical and those who consider all <i>Doctor Who</i> canonical. Within that spectrum many view the licensed <a href="/wiki/Novel.html" title="Novel">novels</a> and <a href="/wiki/Radio_drama.html" title="Radio drama">audio plays</a> as at least near-canonical, and some of those would also include the <i><a href="/wiki/Doctor_Who_Magazine.html" title="Doctor Who Magazine">Doctor Who Magazine</a></i> comic strips. It is generally assumed that all televised <i>Doctor Who</i> episodes from 1963 to 1989, the 1981 spin-off <i><a href="/wiki/K-9_and_Company.html" title="K-9 and Company">K-9 and Company</a></i>, the <a href="/wiki/Doctor_Who_%281996%29.html" title="Doctor Who (1996)">1996 telemovie</a> and the new series, which started in 2005, are canonical, including a 1965 episode in which the <a href="/wiki/First_Doctor.html" title="First Doctor">First Doctor</a> breaks the <a href="/wiki/Fourth_wall.html" title="Fourth wall">fourth wall</a> to wish viewers a Merry <a href="/wiki/Christmas.html" title="Christmas">Christmas</a> ("The Feast of Steven", episode 7 of <i><a href="/wiki/The_Daleks%27_Master_Plan.html" title="The Daleks' Master Plan">The Daleks' Master Plan</a></i>).</p>
<p>Generally, the canonical status of all <a href="/wiki/Doctor_Who_spin-offs.html" title="Doctor Who spin-offs"><i>Doctor Who</i> spin-off</a> media outside of what has been presented on screen (bar obvious spoofs) is debatable, including the <a href="/wiki/BBC_radio.html" title="BBC radio">BBC radio</a> dramas and <a href="/wiki/Webcast.html" title="Webcast">webcasts</a> based upon the show. There have also been several professionally produced films featuring characters and alien races created for <i>Doctor Who</i> that have been licensed directly from the writers who originated them, a loophole that allows the creation of <i>Doctor Who</i> spin-offs that do not reference the Doctor; the canonicity of these productions also falls into a "grey area" in terms of canon.</p>
<p>The two theatrical films based upon the series in the 1960s, starring <a href="/wiki/Peter_Cushing.html" title="Peter Cushing">Peter Cushing</a>, are not generally considered canonical due to their fundamental differences from the TV series continuity, nor is the considerable background information contained in the <a href="/wiki/Role-playing_game.html" title="Role-playing game">role-playing game</a> produced by FASA in the <a href="/wiki/1980s.html" title="1980s">1980s</a>, considered canon due to the many contradictions therein.</p>
<p>Many of the short stories in the BBC anthology <i>Short Trips and Side Steps</i> have settings generally considered non-canonical; for instance, one story features the <a href="/wiki/Cushing_Doctor.html" title="Cushing Doctor">Cushing Doctor</a>, while another is set between the <a href="/wiki/Children_in_Need.html" title="Children in Need">Children in Need</a> <i><a href="/wiki/EastEnders.html" title="EastEnders">EastEnders</a></i> crossover <i><a href="/wiki/Dimensions_in_Time.html" title="Dimensions in Time">Dimensions in Time</a></i> and the Doctor's appearance in the schools' programme <i><a  class="new" title="Search Out Science">Search Out Science</a></i>.</p>
<p>The comic strips (<i>Ground Zero</i>, DWM #238-242), <a href="/wiki/Eighth_Doctor_Adventures.html" title="Eighth Doctor Adventures">Eighth Doctor Adventures</a> (<i><a href="/wiki/Sometime_Never....html" title="Sometime Never...">Sometime Never...</a></i> by <a href="/wiki/Justin_Richards.html" title="Justin Richards">Justin Richards</a>) and the <a href="/wiki/Big_Finish_Productions.html" title="Big Finish Productions">Big Finish Productions</a> audio plays (<i><a href="/wiki/Zagreus_%28Doctor_Who_audio%29.html" title="Zagreus (Doctor Who audio)">Zagreus</a></i>) have all attempted to provide an in-continuity explanation for discrepancies by suggesting that their respective continuities take place in separate <a href="/wiki/Parallel_universe_%28fiction%29.html" title="Parallel universe (fiction)">parallel universes</a>.</p>
<p>A new series of novels based upon the current <i>Doctor Who</i> series is in release. The television series has referred to these (most notably in <i><a href="/wiki/Boom_Town_%28Doctor_Who%29.html" title="Boom Town (Doctor Who)">Boom Town</a></i>, in which <a href="/wiki/Rose_Tyler.html" title="Rose Tyler">Rose Tyler</a> mentioned a trip to the planet Justicia, depicted in the <a href="/wiki/New_Series_Adventures_%28Doctor_Who%29.html" title="New Series Adventures (Doctor Who)">New Series Adventures</a> novel <i><a href="/wiki/The_Monsters_Inside_%28Doctor_Who%29.html" title="The Monsters Inside (Doctor Who)">The Monsters Inside</a></i>). Other episodes also made oblique references to the <i>Doctor Who Magazine</i> comic strip ("kronkburgers" in <i><a href="/wiki/The_Long_Game.html" title="The Long Game">The Long Game</a></i>) and the <a href="/wiki/Virgin_New_Adventures.html" title="Virgin New Adventures">Virgin New Adventures</a> (the planet Lucifer, mentioned in <i><a href="/wiki/Bad_Wolf.html" title="Bad Wolf">Bad Wolf</a></i>, and the Doctor's title "The Oncoming Storm", mentioned in <i><a href="/wiki/The_Long_Game.html" title="The Long Game">The Long Game</a></i>), but these are most likely playful tributes rather than deliberate attempts to dictate a <i>Doctor Who</i> canon. Still, these references are innovations peculiar to the 2005 series; the original 1963–1989 series never referred to adventures published in other media.</p>

<h3>Dune Universe</h3>
<p>The question of what is and what is not canon within the Dune universe raises interesting questions abouts who can label something as 'canon'. Some years after the death of Frank Herbert (the author of the original Dune novels), his son Brian Herbert, in conjunction with Kevin J. Anderson, wrote a series of prequels and sequels to the Dune novels, based on notes left by Frank Herbert (the original series was unfinished). These new works are widely considered to be highly inferior to the original, yet have been labelled as 'canon' by the publishers and Brian Herbert, who own the rights to Dune.</p>
<p>However, it is not possible to know whether Frank Herbert would have considered the new Dune books to be canon or not. Many fans doubt that he would have, given the wide dislike of the new books by fans of the original.</p>
<p>The question that arises is simply, does owning the publishing rights to the works of a deceased author also confer the right to declare subsequent works as 'canon' or not. (A parallel example would be an author today writing sequels to Lord of the Rings on behalf of the copyright owners. It is highly doubtful that anyone would consider work not written by Tolkien to be canonical.)</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Dungeons &amp; Dragons">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Dungeons_.26_Dragons" id="Dungeons_.26_Dragons"></a></p>
<h3>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</h3>
<p>The concept of canon plays an important role in the fantasy <a href="/wiki/Role-playing_game.html" title="Role-playing game">role-playing game</a> <i><a href="/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons.html" title="Dungeons &amp; Dragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></i> (D&amp;D). Over the years, a number of <a href="/wiki/Campaign_setting.html" title="Campaign setting">campaign settings</a> have been published for <i>D&amp;D</i>, each detailing a world or worlds that provide a setting in which the game can be played. There are two types of canon issues that arise from this situation.</p>
<p>The first issue is intra-setting canon, which deals with the backstory, locations and gameplay dynamics considered to be canon within a specific setting. Because <i>D&amp;D</i> generally falls into the fantasy sub-genre of <a href="/wiki/Sword_and_sorcery.html" title="Sword and sorcery">sword and sorcery</a>, canon discrepancies can arise beyond just the typical issues in fiction of history, plot and character. For example, debates regarding canon within a given setting may include such arcana as the source of various magical powers and how they operate within the setting. Theological issues related to the various <a href="/wiki/List_of_deities_of_Dungeons_%26_Dragons.html" title="List of deities of Dungeons &amp; Dragons">deities</a> that may exist within the setting occur, as do disagreements regarding the canon <a href="/wiki/Cosmology.html" title="Cosmology">cosmology</a> of the setting's universe.</p>
<p>The second type of canon problem that arises in <i>D&amp;D</i> is inter-setting canon, concerned primarily with the relationships between different settings. Many <i>D&amp;D</i> publications have discussed how the various settings are related to each other within the <i>D&amp;D</i> <a href="/wiki/Parallel_universe_%28fiction%29.html" title="Parallel universe (fiction)">multiverse</a> of various <a href="/wiki/Plane_%28Dungeons_%26_Dragons%29.html" title="Plane (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)">planes of existence</a>, although these relationships are debated or even denied by some fans of the game.</p>
<p>There is no single "official" canon for <i>D&amp;D</i>. From the very beginnings of the game in the 1970s through to the present, the issue of canon has been left up to each individual <a href="/wiki/Dungeon_Master.html" title="Dungeon Master">Dungeon Master</a>, who runs the game session for the other players. The Dungeon Master is free to determine which published materials (<a href="/wiki/Adventure_%28Dungeons_%26_Dragons%29.html" title="Adventure (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)">adventure modules</a>, novels, sourcebooks, video games, comic books, etc.) are canonical in his or her own campaign, and how the various <i>D&amp;D</i> rules apply to that campaign.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, <i>D&amp;D</i> players often move between games managed by different Dungeon Masters, and many also congregate for gaming tournaments, play in shared <a href="/wiki/Living_campaigns.html" title="Living campaigns">living campaigns</a>, or play the game on-line with different participants than in their normal gaming sessions. In order to achieve even a basic level of continuity among these various game instances, <i>D&amp;D</i> fans must therefore confront the issue of canon.</p>
<p>To achieve the desired level of continuity, various mechanisms are employed to manage <i>D&amp;D</i> "canon." The organizers of gaming tournaments, for example, will often specify which sets of rules and conventions are "in force" for tournament gameplay. Living campaigns may attempt to develop a more comprehensive set of canon materials and sourcebooks, such as the <i><a href="/wiki/Living_Greyhawk_Gazetteer.html" title="Living Greyhawk Gazetteer">Living Greyhawk Gazetteer</a></i> for the <i><a href="/wiki/Living_Greyhawk.html" title="Living Greyhawk">Living Greyhawk</a></i> campaign. And for individually-run games, it is common for Dungeon Masters to briefly discuss their own vision of <i>D&amp;D</i> canon with each new player who joins his or her campaign.</p>
<p>Finally, following the emergence of the World Wide Web, a number of Web sites have arisen that enable players to discuss canon issues and work toward (or reject) canonical norms. These include the Web site of <a href="/wiki/Wizards_of_the_Coast.html" title="Wizards of the Coast">Wizards of the Coast</a><a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.wizards.com/">[3]</a>, the intellectual property rightsholder and publisher for <i>D&amp;D</i>, as well as fan-run sites such as <i>EN World</i><a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.enworld.org/">[4]</a> and <i><a href="/wiki/Canonfire%21.html" title="Canonfire!">Canonfire!</a></i><a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.canonfire.com/">[5]</a>.</p>

<h3><a href="/wiki/Gundam.html" title="Gundam">Gundam</a></h3>
<p>As an extremely prominent franchise that has lasted almost thirty years, the continuity of the Mobile Suit Gundam franchise has been filled by countless works. In addition to the television series, <a href="/wiki/OVA.html" title="OVA">OVAs</a>, and movies, there are a number of spinoffs of more debatable canon, including comics, video games, novels, and other such media. Fans generally consider the animated works to be of primary relevance when dealing with canon, looking to the spinoffs on a case-by-case basis. For example, the popular manga <a href="/wiki/Crossbone_Gundam.html" title="Crossbone Gundam">Crossbone Gundam</a> was penned by Gundam creator <a href="/wiki/Yoshiyuki_Tomino.html" title="Yoshiyuki Tomino">Yoshiyuki Tomino</a> himself, and is generally accepted as full canon. The status of other spinoffs is debated, but there seem to be a number of works that draw confusion. A prime example is the novel Hathaway's Flash; though also penned by Tomino, it draws upon the novelization of <a href="/wiki/Char%27s_Counterattack.html" title="Char's Counterattack">Char's Counterattack</a> for continuity, rather than the animated movie upon which it is based. Despite this, many fans continue to view Hathaway's Flash as being canon. Similarly, the novelization of the original <a href="/wiki/Mobile_Suit_Gundam.html" title="Mobile Suit Gundam">Mobile Suit Gundam</a> is viewed as simply an alternate version of the animated work, as the novel includes the death of protagonist <a href="/wiki/Amuro_Ray.html" title="Amuro Ray">Amuro Ray</a>, who would play a pivotal role in stories set for the next 14 years within the time frame.</p>
<p>One major source of confusion is the production of compilation movies. Such movies were originally produced for Mobile Suit Gundam, and cut several scenes and storylines from the television version for time. Later works have alternately referenced the TV and movie version, leaving the question of which is official up in the air. Similarly, the series <a href="/wiki/Zeta_Gundam.html" title="Zeta Gundam">Zeta Gundam</a> received compilation movies in the 2000s, directed by Tomino himself. Though the movies change many events, all named character death is retained (even though the circumstances of said deaths are often changed). The end result is that, following the movie's continuity, the sequel series <a href="/wiki/Gundam_ZZ.html" title="Gundam ZZ">Gundam ZZ</a> is completely invalidated. Fans tend to accept that the television series is the canon, while the movies represent how Tomino would have handled the series with a more positive outlook. Though compilation movies exist for the alternate universe spinoffs <a href="/wiki/Gundam_Seed.html" title="Gundam Seed">Gundam Seed</a> and <a href="/wiki/Gundam_Seed_Destiny.html" title="Gundam Seed Destiny">Gundam Seed Destiny</a>, these do not raise any major canon issues.</p>
<p>Another interesting matter is the subject of the timeline for <a href="/wiki/Gundam_Wing.html" title="Gundam Wing">Gundam Wing</a>, another popular alternate universe spinoff. Though the animated timeline consists of only the TV show and its movie sequel, <a href="/wiki/Endless_Waltz.html" title="Endless Waltz">Endless Waltz</a>, a number of comic sequels were produced, including three set between the animations, all of which attempt to resolve minor discrepancies between them. However, out of these three comics, two of them (Blind Target and Battlefield of Pacifists) were written by members of the show's writing staff, and are generally accepted to be official, while the third (Ground Zero) is not. In a similar vein, the manga <a  class="new" title="Episode Zero">Episode Zero</a> is accepted as full canon, as an author's note explains that the backstories presented in the book were intended to be animated into the Gundam Wing TV show, but were cut following scheduling conflicts. As with Mobile Suit Gundam, Gundam Wing and Endless Waltz have novel versions, but due to relative unknown these are generally disregarded; this comes despite the fact that the Endless Waltz novel solves one of the major mysteries regarding the character <a href="/wiki/Trowa_Barton.html" title="Trowa Barton">Trowa Barton</a>.</p>
<p>Recently, <a href="/wiki/Sunrise_%28company%29.html" title="Sunrise (company)">Sunrise</a>, the company which owns the rights to Gundam, has attempted to resolve continuity issues generated by the many Gundam video games produced by <a href="/wiki/Bandai.html" title="Bandai">Bandai</a>. These games often introduce new <a href="/wiki/Mobile_suits.html" title="Mobile suits">mobile suits</a>, usually without Sunrise's input. As a result, the military history of the <a href="/wiki/One_Year_War.html" title="One Year War">One Year War</a> (a popular setting for said games), has become mired and uncertain. In 2006, Sunrise launched an initiative called "Harmony of Gundam", with the stated purpose of cleaning up continuity by doing away with a large number of these machines, replacing them with ones specifically created by Sunrise's staff and designed to fit into the existing Gundam universe.</p>

<h3>Harry Potter</h3>
<p>While there is no official statement on what is considered to be <i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter.html" title="Harry Potter">Harry Potter</a></i> canon, the majority of fans generally accept it to be the works which come straight from <a href="/wiki/J._K._Rowling.html" title="J.

Although Rowling is consulted at the writing stage, the Warner Bros. movie adaptations are generally not considered to be canon, and often contain fundamental contradictions with Rowling's works.

<p>Fans of <a href="/wiki/Ian_Fleming.html" title="Ian Fleming">Ian Fleming</a>'s superspy are divided over what is considered official canon. There is little argument that all of Fleming's original short stories and novels are canon, and some include the <a href="/wiki/Kingsley_Amis.html" title="Kingsley Amis">Kingsley Amis</a> Bond novel, <i><a href="/wiki/Colonel_Sun.html" title="Colonel Sun">Colonel Sun</a></i> in this canon as well. The status of the <a href="/wiki/John_Gardner_%28thriller_writer%29.html" title="John Gardner (thriller writer)">John Gardner</a> and <a href="/wiki/Raymond_Benson.html" title="Raymond Benson">Raymond Benson</a> Bond novels in canon is less certain, since both book series have been updated and feature elements and characters created for the movie series. Benson's novels are particularly controversial as they appear to be based upon the Bond movie universe, rather than the literary Bond. The various Bond film novelizations are generally considered <a href="/wiki/Apocrypha.html" title="Apocrypha">apocryphal</a>, as is a 1970s "authorized biography" of Bond by <a href="/wiki/John_Pearson_%28author%29.html" title="John Pearson (author)">John Pearson</a>.</p>
<p>A new series of novels featuring a <a href="/wiki/Young_Bond.html" title="Young Bond">teenage Bond</a> written by <a href="/wiki/Charlie_Higson.html" title="Charlie Higson">Charlie Higson</a> was released in the beginning of <a href="/wiki/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>. It remains to be seen if this series will be considered official canon. The TV series <i><a href="/wiki/James_Bond_Jr..html" title="James Bond Jr.">James Bond Jr.</a></i>, while officially licensed, is not considered canonical.</p>
<p>The Bond movies, meanwhile, appear to exist somewhat outside of any canon. Although there is some between-films continuity (e.g. references to the death of Bond's wife), the ever-changing cast has rendered any sort of canon determination virtually impossible. However, as some of the films take place over such a short space of time (the film <i><a href="/wiki/GoldenEye.html" title="GoldenEye">GoldenEye</a></i> only covers 2 days), some aspects, such as Bond's apparent inability to age, can be accepted without too many questions.</p>
<p>Major changes in a character's age and appearance are taken in stride by comic book fans; a similar approach could create one continuity for the movies, though still independent of the books. This appears to be the approach taken by the book <i>James Bond: The Secret World of 007</i>. It presents a Bond who looks like Pierce Brosnan (except in an appendix giving production information on the movies, all other actors playing Bond are only shown from the back) who remembers the events of <i><a href="/wiki/Dr._No.html" title="Dr. No">Dr. No</a></i>.

<h3>Mortal Kombat</h3>
<p>The <i><a href="/wiki/Mortal_Kombat.html" title="Mortal Kombat">Mortal Kombat</a></i> series has an especially intriguing and complex plot canon. Every game in the series features a different ending for each character. Often, the endings in a single game will contradict each other (with a few exceptions, such as <a href="/wiki/Baraka.html" title="Baraka">Baraka</a>'s ending only happening if <a href="/wiki/Mileena.html" title="Mileena">Mileena</a>'s does, which in turn, relies on <a href="/wiki/Bo%27_Rai_Cho.html" title="Bo' Rai Cho">Bo' Rai Cho</a>'s ending, all in <i><a  title="Mortal Kombat: Deception">Mortal Kombat: Deception</a></i>). Fans tend to speculate about which endings are canon from whatever game has most recently been released, however the "true" endings are never officially known until the plot of the next game is revealed. Because not every ending from a game can be true, the majority of the endings from each game are non-canon. Additionally, portions of some endings may be considered canon while the rest of the ending is ignored.</p>
<p>An interesting trend associated with this line of canon plot is that nearly every game assumes the "good guys" (typically, the Earthrealm kombatants) prevailed over the "bad guys." In fact, this trend has only recently been broken, with the release of 2004's <i><a  title="Mortal Kombat: Deception">Mortal Kombat: Deception</a></i>, which assumes that Earthrealm's warriors lost and died at the hands of the <a href="/wiki/Deadly_Alliance.html" title="Deadly Alliance">Deadly Alliance</a>.</p>

However, Capcom has yet to classify the canonical status for many of the side-games, namely the <i>Gun Survivor</i> series and <i>Resident Evil Outbreak</i> games.

<h3>The Simpsons</h3>
<p>In <i><a href="/wiki/The_Simpsons.html" title="The Simpsons">The Simpsons</a></i>, most episodes are considered to be canon, though some may not be able to match others exactly. There is one episode that parodies this: Ned Flanders gives Homer a football ticket and they become friends by the end of the episode. <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.simpsoncrazy.com/episodeguide/season5/1f14.shtml">[9]</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lisa: <i>Don't worry, Bart. It seems like every week something odd happens to the Simpsons. My advice is to ride it out, make the occasional smart-aleck quip, and by next week we'll be back to where we started from, ready for another wacky adventure.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Bart: <i>Ay, caramba!</i></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Lisa: <i>That's the spirit.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the last scene of the episode, it is like none of it ever happened. This is actually something of a recurring joke; in several episodes this idea of a "status quo" is mentioned, which basically decrees that any change in the Simpsons universe will revert before the episode ends. There is a similar episode involving the past of Principal Skinner which ends in the same fashion, where the Springfield Judge rules that the events of the episode should not be spoken of again. In a later episode, Lisa calls Skinner by his real name when he questions her naming her new cat, identical to Snowball II, Snowball II after the original Snowball II, as well as several other pet cats, die.</p>
<p>Some episodes contain references to others, such as mentions of the Simpson family having travelled to all of the continents in the world, save Antarctica; other times, when things <i>don't</i> revert to the status quo at the end of an episode, whatever happened is canon and can thus be referenced in other episodes (for example, Maude Flanders' death, or Apu being married and having children, etc.) One issue of continuity that is unlikely to be definitively decided is the question of where the Simpsons' home town of Springfield is. Most clues about Springfield's location are contradictory, which is completely intentional. In one episode, Springfield is shown on a map as being in north-west Tennessee, but other episodes contradict this.</p>
<p>Some special episodes, such as the <a href="/wiki/Treehouse_of_Horror.html" title="Treehouse of Horror">Treehouse of Horror</a> specials, clip shows, and "<a href="/wiki/Behind_the_Laughter.html" title="Behind the Laughter">Behind the Laughter</a>", are not considered to be canon.</p>
<p><i>Simpsons</i> cartoons, books, video games and the original <i>Shorts</i>, which appeared as filler material in <i><a href="/wiki/The_Tracey_Ullman_Show.html" title="The Tracey Ullman Show">The Tracey Ullman Show</a></i> and featured what could be considered prototypes of the <i>Simpsons</i> characters are not considered canonical.</p>

<p><a name="Sonic_the_Hedgehog" id="Sonic_the_Hedgehog"></a></p>
<h3>Sonic the Hedgehog</h3>
<p>Initially, Sega began two different storylines to localize Sonic as a product. These storylines are described in the Japanese and the western game manuals. So there are in fact two canons recognized by the fanbase in its entirety, and many storylines that have expanded on them. There is of course ongoing debate as to whether or not one canon should be considered over the other. But reasons (such as the western storyline being established first, to Sonic Team siding with the Japanese storyline) are opinionated, and thus have little factually to support why one should be considered more canon over the other.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the Dreamcast era, Sonic Team took the liberty to choose what canon they wanted to expand on with the newer generation games, and they chose the Japanese storyline, thus making it the international canon while discontinuing the old western canon. The series ongoing storyline have become increasingly complex with each subsequent game ever since. The games <i><a href="/wiki/Sonic_the_Hedgehog_%2816-bit%29.html" title="Sonic the Hedgehog (16-bit)">Sonic 1</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Sonic_the_Hedgehog_2_%2816-bit%29.html" title="Sonic the Hedgehog 2 (16-bit)">Sonic 2</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Sonic_the_Hedgehog_3.html" title="Sonic the Hedgehog 3">Sonic 3</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Sonic_and_Knuckles.html" title="Sonic and Knuckles">Sonic &amp; Knuckles</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Sonic_Adventure.html" title="Sonic Adventure">Sonic Adventure</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Sonic_Adventure_2.html" title="Sonic Adventure 2">Sonic Adventure 2</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Sonic_Heroes.html" title="Sonic Heroes">Sonic Heroes</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Shadow_the_Hedgehog_%28video_game%29.html" title="Shadow the Hedgehog (video game)">Shadow The Hedgehog</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Sonic_Riders.html" title="Sonic Riders">Sonic Riders</a></i> are absolute canon, since they were directly created by Sonic Team. <i><a href="/wiki/Sonic_CD.html" title="Sonic CD">Sonic CD</a></i> is also absolute canon, since the events in the game has been referred to in <i><a href="/wiki/Sonic_Adventure.html" title="Sonic Adventure">Sonic Adventure</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Sonic_Heroes.html" title="Sonic Heroes">Sonic Heroes</a></i>. The unreleased game called <i><a href="/wiki/Sonic_the_Hedgehog_%282006_game%29.html" title="Sonic the Hedgehog (2006 game)">Sonic the Hedgehog</a></i> for the Playstation 3 and Xbox 360 will also be canon. However, most other games are usually considered canonical too, unless they somehow explicitly contradict the Sonic Team made games (though they rarely have any influence on the main series anyway). The various Sonic mangas and animes are <i>not</i> considered canonical to the games, and are instead presumed to take place in their own induvidual continuities.</p>
<p>The west has in fact developed many cartoons (<a href="/wiki/AoStH.html" title="AoStH">AoStH</a>, <a href="/wiki/SatAM.html" title="SatAM">SatAM</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Sonic_Underground.html" title="Sonic Underground">Sonic Underground</a>), and comics (the US Sonic comic published by Archie, and another published by Fleetway). Of those, only a select few expansions have been recognized and added to the western storyline in games such as <i>Sonic Spinball</i> and <i>Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine</i>, those being SatAM, Archie and AoStH.</p>

<h3>Soul Calibur</h3>
<p>In the <i>Soul</i> series of <a href="/wiki/Fighting_game.html" title="Fighting game">fighting games</a>, it can be difficult to determine which storyline is canon, as each character has his or her own storyline, usually ending with that character possessing <a href="/wiki/Soul_Calibur_mystical_weapons.html" title="Soul Calibur mystical weapons">Soul Edge</a> or <a href="/wiki/Soul_Calibur_mystical_weapons#History_.28Soul_Calibur.29.html" title="Soul Calibur mystical weapons">Soul Calibur</a>. Since this cannot logically be the case, the actual story of the <i>Soul Calibur</i> series must be pieced together by obtaining various profiles available within the games. It is also notable that usually only one or so endings involving the magical swords ends up being canon, as it is referenced in later volumes.</p>

<p>The <i>Stargate</i> fictional universe canon consists of:</p>
<ul>
<li>An original <a href="/wiki/1994.html" title="1994">1994</a> movie entitled <i><a href="/wiki/Stargate_%28film%29.html" title="Stargate (film)">Stargate</a></i>, which was intended to be the first of at least three, but was left to stand alone by its producers as <a href="/wiki/Roland_Emmerich.html" title="Roland Emmerich">Roland Emmerich</a> moved on to <i><a href="/wiki/Independence_Day_%28film%29.html" title="Independence Day (film)">Independence Day</a></i>.</li>
<li>Subsequent novels by Bill McCay which carried on the story based on Emmerich's notes (not considered canon after the addition of the next bullet). However, considering Emmerich's and Devlin's penchant for action, it is disputed how much these books resemble anything that would have been filmed.</li>
<li>A <a href="/wiki/Spin-off.html" title="Spin-off">spin-off</a> TV series by Brad Wright and Jonathan Glassner called <i><a href="/wiki/Stargate_SG-1.html" title="Stargate SG-1">Stargate SG-1</a></i> which carried on one year after the story of the film <i>Stargate</i>, and followed different developments from those described in the novels. This is generally considered canon over the books.</li>
<li>A further spin-off called <i><a href="/wiki/Stargate_Atlantis.html" title="Stargate Atlantis">Stargate Atlantis</a></i> which develops a strand of the plot of <i>Stargate SG-1</i>. There was also an animated series named <i><a href="/wiki/Stargate_Infinity.html" title="Stargate Infinity">Stargate Infinity</a></i> which was acknowledged by its producers to strictly not be canon.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some fans consider <i>Stargate SG-1</i> to be incompatible with the movie due to a few minor changes in small details of the film's plot when carried into the television series. However, most fans and even the producers pass over these details as insignificant. Also, the writers have made comments that could be interpreted as making the <i>SG-1</i> episode "<a href="/wiki/Hathor_%28Stargate_SG-1%29.html" title="Hathor (Stargate SG-1)">Hathor</a>" non-canonical.</p>

However, circa 1987, when Star Trek: The Next Generation was debuting, <a href="/wiki/Gene_Roddenberry.html" title="Gene Roddenberry">Gene Roddenberry</a> and <a href="/wiki/Paramount_Pictures.html" title="Paramount Pictures">Paramount Pictures</a> agreed on a new canon policy that made <i>Star Trek: The Animated Series</i> non-canonical as well as removing the canon status of all technical manuals and novels. Gene Roddenberry further stated that some elements from the films <i><a  title="Star Trek V: The Final Frontier">Star Trek V: The Final Frontier</a></i> and <i><a  title="Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country">Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country</a></i> were "slightly apocryphal". The writers and production staff of Star Trek have also said in interviews and DVD commentaries that they unofficially struck the episode of Star Trek: Voyager "<i><a href="/wiki/Threshold_%28Voyager_episode%29.html" title="Threshold (Voyager episode)">Threshold</a></i>" from canon, and made no references to the events of that episode after it was made; officially, however, being an on-screen, televised story, it remains officially canonical.</p>
<p>The canonicity of the various reference books such as <i><a href="/wiki/The_Star_Trek_Encyclopedia.html" title="The Star Trek Encyclopedia">The Star Trek Encyclopedia</a></i> and various companions accompanying the series is still debated. Many consider such reference works to be canon, while others do not; there is currently no clear answer solving this problem. It should be noted that most of the information from the <i>The Star Trek Encyclopedia</i> and <i>The Star Trek Chronology</i> comes directly from the television series and movies, which themselves are canon, and the books were written by people who worked on the production staff, and sometimes used as internal references. A similar problem exists with <a href="/wiki/Trading_card.html" title="Trading card">trading cards</a> cataloging information from the series.</p>

<p>The <i><a href="/wiki/Star_Wars.html" title="Star Wars">Star Wars</a></i> canon is a complex issue, and Lucas Licensing has devised a four-level system called the "<a href="/wiki/Holocron.html" title="Holocron">Holocron</a> continuity database" to keep track of the <i>Star Wars</i> canon. The purpose of this database is to chronicle all <i>Star Wars</i> stories, and settle any disputes that may arise within the various productions. The basic rule, however, is that the <i>Star Wars</i> canon comprises the six <i>Star Wars</i> films, along with all officially licensed <i>Star Wars</i> stories not contradicting the films.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the DK Guide to the entire universe utilises many spin-offs to help describe the six films.</p>

<p>Another notable animation series in this context is <i><a href="/wiki/South_Park.html" title="South Park">South Park</a></i>. It follows the misbehavings of a group of four friends. At the end of most early episodes, the character of <a href="/wiki/Kenny_McCormick.html" title="Kenny McCormick">Kenny</a> dies, but at the start of each new episode, he's found to be alive again. Whilst this was originally "explained" when he inexplicably faded back into existence at the beginning of "Cartman's Mom Is Still A Dirty Slut", it was later revealed that Kenny's mother gives birth to a new 'Kenny' immediately after the passing of the old one, and names him Kenny in an homage for the previous, deceased son. The 'Kenny' born when this explanation was made was the 52nd. However, this was primarily a joke lampooning the show's lack of continuity on the matter, and as such, isn't canon. Other issues---for example, whether or not <i><a href="/wiki/Terrance_and_Phillip.html" title="Terrance and Phillip">Terrance and Phillip</a></i> is animated or how <a href="/wiki/Saddam_Hussein.html" title="Saddam Hussein">Saddam Hussein</a> died---show the show has a loose continuity.</p>

<p>The Transformers universe is often depicted divergently depending on the writer and media. Even at the birth of the Transformers property in 1984, there were always multiple and mutually exclusive storylines, with the most prominent two being Marvel Productions' cartoon series and Marvel Comics' comic series. Since then, Transformers has been an unending surge of new universes, making any discussion of Transformers "canon" difficult. If the term is to be applied at all to Transformers, it must be either in the sense of a single multiversal canon which incorporates all officially-produced Transformers fiction, or as a set of separate but equally "true" (although not equally known or popular) canons which likewise covers all licensed Transformers stories.</p>

<h3>Warhammer 40,000</h3>
<p>The canon of <a href="/wiki/Games_Workshop.html" title="Games Workshop">Games Workshop</a>'s <a href="/wiki/Warhammer_40%2C000.html" title="Warhammer 40,000">Warhammer 40,000</a> universe is officially held to be extended to all works produced under an official Games Workshop licence: this means that all works produced by Games Workshop since <a href="/wiki/Rogue_Trader_%28Warhammer_40%2C000%29.html" title="Rogue Trader (Warhammer 40,000)">Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader</a> are canonical until superseded, and no works produced without official blessing are considered canon at all (although increasingly in the last ten years since the Internet enabled fans to widely disseminate their own works such material has later been subsumed into official Games Workshop publications). However, the very far-reaching changes in game background and tone over the first three revisions of the core rulebook and background sourcebooks have invalidated very large parts of a history once considered canon (although the original Rogue Trader deliberately avoided establishing too many solid universal details for the sake of ensuring the game could be expanded by gamesmasters according to the prevailing logic in the science fiction gaming community at the late <a href="/wiki/1980s.html" title="1980s">1980s</a>).</p>
<p>Almost all current consumers of Games Workshop material hold material to be canon only until superseded by more recent publications. Isolated communities of gamers who reject recent changes in game history and rules by the company exist, connected either locally by gaming groups or globally via Internet message boards (<a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.easternfringe.com/">[10]</a>); these groups commonly either reject the widespread changes made to the core rules and background in the third revision of the rulebook and supporting material or reject all material which contradicts the original <a href="/wiki/1987.html" title="1987">1987</a> Rogue Trader publication (as almost all work released after the original book introduced specific <a href="/wiki/Timeline.html" title="Timeline">timeline</a> items which sought to direct the Gamesmaster in ways which seemingly contradicted the extremely open-ended <a href="/wiki/Science_fantasy.html" title="Science fantasy">Science Fantasy</a> background of the original book).</p>

<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Other factors">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Other_factors" id="Other_factors"></a></p>
<h2>Other factors</h2>
<p>No actual industry label exists for definitively designating published works as canon. Canon is largely a subjective notion, referring to a shared understanding that exists between the published works in a fictional series and the level of acceptance by a vocal but otherwise accepting wide audience. As such, canon can simultaneously refer to the considerations of the publishers of a fictional series as well as what the fanbase chooses to consider as authentic.</p>
<p>The fact the majority of fans of a fictional setting view certain things as non-canonical, or even an official statement to that effect from its creators, does not oblige everyone to agree. In addition, a story can belong to two overlapping canons. The most obvious example of this is <a href="/wiki/Philip_Jos%C3%A9_Farmer.html" title="Philip José Farmer">Philip José Farmer</a>'s <a href="/wiki/Wold_Newton_family.html" title="Wold Newton family">Wold Newton family</a>. Some (but not all) of the adventures of Sherlock Holmes, <a href="/wiki/Tarzan.html" title="Tarzan">Tarzan</a>, <a href="/wiki/Doc_Savage.html" title="Doc Savage">Doc Savage</a> etc. are canonical in the Wold Newton setting. This does not mean that the events of Farmer's books are canonical from a Sherlockian perspective. Similarly, fans of <a href="/wiki/Laurie_R._King.html" title="Laurie R. King">Laurie R. King</a>'s novels of <a href="/wiki/Sherlock_Holmes.html" title="Sherlock Holmes">Sherlock Holmes</a> and <a href="/wiki/Mary_Russell.html" title="Mary Russell">Mary Russell</a> consider all the Holmes stories to be canonical in King's setting.</p>
<p>The difference can be even less clear cut than this. Current <i>Star Trek</i> novels maintain a tight continuity with each other, and avoid contradicting the television series. When a <i>Lost Era</i> novel set between the movies and <i>The Next Generation</i> features a younger version of a character introduced in a <i>Deep Space Nine</i> novel, it's obvious there's some sort of "canonical" novel-setting, even if the TV series is not obliged to conform to it. This is where <a href="/wiki/Fanon_%28fiction%29.html" title="Fanon (fiction)">fanon</a> and canon often collide, especially when a TV series, movie or other officially canonical source contradicts it. An example is the <i>Trek</i> novel <i><a  class="new" title="Starfleet Year One">Starfleet Year One</a></i> which appeared in print before the TV series <i><a  title="Star Trek: Enterprise">Star Trek: Enterprise</a></i> was announced, but was completely invalidated by the series; there are some <i>Trek</i> fans who prefer the <i>Starfleet Year One</i> version of events as canon, rejecting the TV series. Generally, though, in the case of televised fiction, only facts which appear in the as-originally-aired version of a program are considered canonical (including scenes cut from re-runs, but not including such things as deleted scenes and scenes from unaired pilots and other such material that 'leaks out' over the internet).</p>
<p>Furthermore, the issue is also complicated when the definition of canon changes well after the fictional universe is established. As an example, in the 1970s and 1980s, there were a number of reference works published by <a href="/wiki/Franz_Joseph_%28artist%29.html" title="Franz Joseph (artist)">Franz Joseph</a> and <a href="/wiki/FASA.html" title="FASA">FASA</a> Corporation for <i>Star Trek</i>. These books were considered canonical at the time (some even made with explicit approval of Gene Roddenberry), and were used almost universally by novel and comic book authors, as well as the production staff of the earlier Star Trek movies (information from these manuals was read as background dialog in some scenes and diagrams were used as computer displays). However, in <a href="/wiki/1988.html" title="1988">1988</a>, as part of the release of Star Trek: The Next Generation, Gene Roddenberry and Paramount Pictures changed their policies regarding canon and stripped these books of their canonical status, as the new series quickly made many changes and revelations which openly contradicted earlier canonical books. Thus, a book that would be considered completely canonical in 1985 like <i><a href="/wiki/The_Star_Trek_Star_Fleet_Technical_Manual.html" title="The Star Trek Star Fleet Technical Manual">The Star Trek Star Fleet Technical Manual</a></i>, would be considered non-canonical in 1995.</p>
<p>In some fictional universes, interviews and other communications from authors are also considered canon - like <a href="/wiki/The_Letters_of_J._R._R._Tolkien.html" title="The Letters of J. R. R. Tolkien">the letters of J. R. R. Tolkien</a> with relation to <a href="/wiki/Middle-earth.html" title="Middle-earth">Middle-earth</a>; also items such as interviews, internet chat sessions, and Web sites (e.g., the Web site of <a href="/wiki/J._K._Rowling.html" title="J. K. Rowling">J. K. Rowling</a> in relation to <a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter.html" title="Harry Potter">Harry Potter</a>). This usually only happens in cases where all works in the universe have the same author.</p>
