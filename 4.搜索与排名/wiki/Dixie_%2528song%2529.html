<p><b>"Dixie"</b>, also known as <b>"I Wish I Was in Dixie"</b>, <b>"Dixie's Land"</b>, and by other titles, is a <a href="/wiki/American_popular_music.html" title="American popular music">popular American song</a>. It is one of the most distinctively American musical products of the 19th century,<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a  title="">[1]</a></sup> and probably the best-known song to have come out of <a href="/wiki/Blackface.html" title="Blackface">blackface</a> <a href="/wiki/Minstrel_show.html" title="Minstrel show">minstrelsy</a>.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a  title="">[2]</a></sup> Although not a <a href="/wiki/Folk_song.html" title="Folk song">folk song</a> at its creation, "Dixie" has since entered the American folk vernacular. The song likely cemented the word "<a href="/wiki/Dixie.html" title="Dixie">Dixie</a>" in the <a href="/wiki/American_English.html" title="American English">American</a> vocabulary as a synonym for the <a href="/wiki/Southern_United_States.html" title="Southern United States">Southern United States</a>.</p>
<p>Most sources credit <a href="/wiki/Ohio.html" title="Ohio">Ohio</a>-born <a href="/wiki/Dan_Emmett.html" title="Dan Emmett">Daniel Decatur Emmett</a> with the song's composition; however many other people have claimed to have composed "Dixie", even during Emmett's lifetime. Compounding the problem of definitively establishing the song's authorship are Emmett's own confused accounts of its writing, and his tardiness in having "Dixie" <a href="/wiki/Copyright.html" title="Copyright">copyrighted</a>. The latest challenge has come on behalf of the <a href="/wiki/Snowden_Family_Band.html" title="Snowden Family Band">Snowden Family</a> of <a href="/wiki/Knox_County%2C_Ohio.html" title="Knox County, Ohio">Knox County</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ohio.html" title="Ohio">Ohio</a>, who may have collaborated with Emmett to write "Dixie".</p>
<p>The song originated in the blackface minstrel show of the 1850s and quickly grew famous across the United States. Its lyrics, written in a <a href="/wiki/Racism.html" title="Racism">racist</a>, exaggerated version of <a href="/wiki/African_American_English_Vernacular.html" title="African American English Vernacular">African American English Vernacular</a>, tell the story of a freed black <a href="/wiki/History_of_slavery_in_the_United_States.html" title="History of slavery in the United States">slave</a> pining for the plantation of his birth. During the <a href="/wiki/American_Civil_War.html" title="American Civil War">American Civil War</a>, "Dixie" was adopted as a de facto <a href="/wiki/National_anthem.html" title="National anthem">anthem</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Confederate_States_of_America.html" title="Confederate States of America">Confederacy</a>. New versions appeared at this time that more explicitly tied the song to the events of the Civil War. Since the advent of the <a href="/wiki/American_Civil_Rights_Movement_%281955-1968%29.html" title="American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968)">American Civil Rights Movement</a>, many have identified the lyrics of the song with the iconography and ideology of the <a href="/wiki/Old_South.html" title="Old South">Old South</a>. Today, "Dixie" is sometimes considered offensive, and its critics link the act of singing it to sympathy for the concept of slavery in the American South. Its supporters, on the other hand, view it as a legitimate aspect of Southern culture and heritage.</p>

<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>"Dixie" is structured into 32 <a href="/wiki/Bar_%28music%29.html" title="Bar (music)">measure</a> groups of alternating <a href="/wiki/Verse.html" title="Verse">verses</a> and <a href="/wiki/Refrain.html" title="Refrain">refrains</a>, following an AABC pattern. As originally performed, the verse featured a <a href="/wiki/Solo_%28music%29.html" title="Solo (music)">soloist</a> alternating with a small group of singers; the refrain was sung in unison by the whole troupe. Traditionally, another eight measures of unaccompanied <a href="/wiki/Fiddle.html" title="Fiddle">fiddle</a> playing followed, coming to a partial close in the middle; since 1936, this part has rarely been printed with the sheet music.</p>
<p>The song was traditionally played at a slower <a href="/wiki/Tempo.html" title="Tempo">tempo</a> than most listeners are familiar with today. Rhythmically, the music is "characterized by a heavy, nonchalant, inelegant strut",<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a  title="">[3]</a></sup> and is in <a href="/wiki/Duple_meter.html" title="Duple meter">duple meter</a>, which makes it suitable for both dancing and marching. "Dixie" employs a single rhythmic <a href="/wiki/Motif_%28music%29.html" title="Motif (music)">motive</a> (two <a href="/wiki/Sixteenth_note.html" title="Sixteenth note">sixteenth note</a> <a href="/wiki/Anacrusis.html" title="Anacrusis">pickups</a> followed by a longer note), which is "integrated into long, melodic phrases. The melodic content consists primarily of <a href="/wiki/Arpeggio.html" title="Arpeggio">arpeggiations</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Tonic_%28music%29.html" title="Tonic (music)">tonic</a> <a href="/wiki/Triad_%28music%29.html" title="Triad (music)">triad</a>, firmly establishing the <a href="/wiki/Major_%28music%29.html" title="Major (music)">major</a> <a href="/wiki/Tonality.html" title="Tonality">tonality</a>. The melody of the chorus emulates natural inflections of the voice (particularly on the word "away"), and may account for some of the song's popularity.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a  title="">[4]</a></sup></p>

<p>According to <a href="/wiki/Musicology.html" title="Musicology">musicologist</a> Hans Nathan, "Dixie" resembles other material that <a href="/wiki/Dan_Emmett.html" title="Dan Emmett">Dan Emmett</a> wrote for <a href="/wiki/Bryant%27s_Minstrels.html" title="Bryant's Minstrels">Bryant's Minstrels</a>, and in writing it, the composer drew on a number of earlier works. The first part of the song is anticipated by other Emmett compositions, including "<a href="/wiki/De_Wild_Goose-Nation.html" title="De Wild Goose-Nation">De Wild Goose-Nation</a>" (1844), itself a derivative of "<a href="/wiki/Gumbo_Chaff.html" title="Gumbo Chaff">Gumbo Chaff</a>" (1830s) and ultimately an 18th-century <a href="/wiki/Music_of_England.html" title="Music of England">English</a> song called "<a  class="new" title="Bow Wow Wow (song)">Bow Wow Wow</a>". The second part is probably related to even older material, most likely <a href="/wiki/Music_of_Scotland.html" title="Music of Scotland">Scottish</a> folk songs.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a  title="">[5]</a></sup> The chorus follows portions of "<a href="/wiki/Johnny_Roach.html" title="Johnny Roach">Johnny Roach</a>", an Emmett piece from earlier in 1859.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a  title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>As with other <a href="/wiki/Blackface.html" title="Blackface">blackface</a> material, performances of "Dixie" were accompanied by dancing. The song is a <a href="/wiki/Walkaround.html" title="Walkaround">walkaround</a>, which originally began with a few <a href="/wiki/Minstrel_show.html" title="Minstrel show">minstrels</a> acting out the lyrics, only to be joined by the rest of the company (a dozen or so individuals for the Bryants). According to a musician named <a  class="new" title="Oscar Coon">Oscar Coon</a>, Bryant's Minstrels performed a <a href="/wiki/Jig.html" title="Jig">jig</a> to "Dixie" called Beans of Albany. This is probably Albany Beef, the <a href="/wiki/Scotch-Irish.html" title="Scotch-Irish">Scotch-Irish</a> dance that Emmett refers to in a book on fife instruction.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a  title="">[7]</a></sup> A single dancer used the fiddle solo at the end of the song to "strut, twirl his cane, or mustache, and perhaps slyly wink at a girl on the front row."<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a  title="">[8]</a></sup></p>

<p>The lyrics of "Dixie" reflect the mood of the United States in the late 1850s toward growing <a href="/wiki/Abolitionism.html" title="Abolitionism">abolitionist</a> sentiment. The song presents the point of view, common to minstrelsy at the time, that <a href="/wiki/History_of_slavery_in_the_United_States.html" title="History of slavery in the United States">slavery</a> was overall a positive institution. The pining slave had been used in minstrel tunes since the early 1850s, including Emmett's "<a href="/wiki/I_Ain%27t_Got_Time_to_Tarry.html" title="I Ain't Got Time to Tarry">I Ain't Got Time to Tarry</a>" and "Johnny Roach". The fact that "Dixie" and its precursors are <a href="/wiki/Dance_music.html" title="Dance music">dance tunes</a> only further makes light of the subject.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a  title="">[9]</a></sup> In short, "Dixie" makes the case, more strongly than any previous minstrel tune had, that slaves belong in bondage.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a  title="">[10]</a></sup> This is accomplished through the song's protagonist, who, in pseudo-<a href="/wiki/African_American_Vernacular_English.html" title="African American Vernacular English">black dialect</a>, implies that despite his freedom, he is homesick for the <a href="/wiki/Plantation.html" title="Plantation">plantation</a> of his birth:</p>
<dl>
<dd>I wish I was in de land ob cotton,</dd>
<dd>Old times dar am not forgotten;</dd>
<dd>Look away! Look away! Look away! Dixie Land.</dd>
<dd>In Dixie Land whar I was born in,</dd>
<dd>Early on one frosty mornin,</dd>
<dd>Look away! Look away! Look away! Dixie Land.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The remaining verses drift into the common minstrel idiom of a comical plantation scenario, "supposedly [depicting] the gayer side of life for slaves on Southern plantations":<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a  title="">[11]</a></sup></p>
<dl>
<dd>Old Missus marry "Will-de-weaber,"</dd>
<dd>Willium was a gay deceaber;</dd>
<dd>Look away! Look away! Look away! Dixie Land.</dd>
<dd>But when he put his arm around'er,</dd>
<dd>He smilled as fierce as a forty-pound'er,</dd>
<dd>Look away! Look away! Look away! Dixie Land.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The final verse mixes <a href="/wiki/Nonsense.html" title="Nonsense">nonsense</a> and dance steps with the freed-slave scenario:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Dar's buck-wheat cake an 'Ingen' batter,</dd>
<dd>Makes you fat or a little fatter;</dd>
<dd>Look away! Look away! Look away! Dixie Land.</dd>
<dd>Den hoe it down an scratch your grabble,</dd>
<dd>To Dixie land I'm bound to trabble.</dd>
<dd>Look away! Look away! Look away! Dixie Land.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a  title="">[12]</a></sup></dd>
</dl>
<p>The lyrics use many common phrases found in minstrel tunes of the day—"I wish I was in . . ." dates to at least "<a href="/wiki/Clare_de_Kitchen.html" title="Clare de Kitchen">Clare de Kitchen</a>" (early 1830s), and "Away down south in . . ." appears in many more songs, including Emmett's "<a href="/wiki/I%27m_Gwine_ober_de_Mountain.html" title="I'm Gwine ober de Mountain">I'm Gwine ober de Mountain</a>" (1843). The second <a href="/wiki/Stanza.html" title="Stanza">stanza</a> clearly echoes "Gumbo Chaff" from the 1830s: "Den Missus she did marry Big Bill de weaver / Soon she found out he was a gay deceiver."<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a  title="">[13]</a></sup> The final stanza rewords portions of Emmett's own "De Wild Goose-Nation": "De tarapin he thot it was time for to trabble / He screw aron his tail and begin to scratch grabble."<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a  title="">[14]</a></sup> Even the phrase "Dixie's land" had been used in Emmett's "Johnny Roach" and "I Ain't Got Time to Tarry", both first performed earlier in 1859.</p>
<p>As with other minstrel material, "Dixie" entered common circulation among blackface performers, and many of them added their own verses or altered the song in other ways. Emmett himself adopted the tune for a pseudo-African American <a href="/wiki/Spiritual_%28music%29.html" title="Spiritual (music)">spiritual</a> in the 1870s or 1880s. The chorus changed to:</p>
<dl>
<dd>I wish I was in Canaan</dd>
<dd>Oaber dar—Oaber dar,</dd>
<dd>In Canaan's lann de color'd man</dd>
<dd>Can lib an die in cloaber</dd>
<dd>Oaber dar—Oaber dar,</dd>
<dd>Oaber dar in de lann ob Canaan.<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a  title="">[15]</a></sup></dd>

<p>Both Union and Confederate composers produced war versions of the song during the <a href="/wiki/American_Civil_War.html" title="American Civil War">American Civil War</a>. These variants standardized the spelling and made the song more militant, injecting into the lyrics specific references to the conflict or to Northern or Southern pride. This <a href="/wiki/Confederate_States_of_American.html" title="Confederate States of American">Confederate</a> verse by <a href="/wiki/Albert_Pike.html" title="Albert Pike">Albert Pike</a> is representative:</p>

<p>"The New Dixie!: The True 'Dixie' for Northern Singers" takes a different approach, turning the original song on its head:</p>

<dl>
<dd>Hooray! Hooray!</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>

<dd>Nor lib no die in Dixie<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a  title="">[18]</a></sup></dd>
</dl>
<p>Soldiers on both sides wrote endless <a href="/wiki/Parody.html" title="Parody">parody</a> versions of the song. Often these discussed the banalities of camp life: "Pork and cabbage in the pot, / It goes in cold and comes out hot," or, "Vinegar put right on red beet, / It makes them always fit to eat". Others were more nonsensical: "Way down South in the fields of cotton, / Vinegar shoes and paper stockings".<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a  title="">[19]</a></sup></p>
<p>Aside from its being rendered in standard English, the chorus was the only section not regularly altered, even for parodies:</p>

<p>According to tradition, <a href="/wiki/Ohio.html" title="Ohio">Ohio</a>-born minstrel show composer Daniel Decatur Emmett wrote "Dixie" around 1859. Over his lifetime, Emmett often recounted the story of its composition, and details vary with each account. For example, in various versions of the story, Emmett claimed to have written "Dixie" in a few minutes, in a single night, and over a few days.<sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a  title="">[21]</a></sup> An 1872 edition of <i><a href="/wiki/The_New_York_Clipper.html" title="The New York Clipper">The New York Clipper</a></i> provides one of the earliest accounts, claiming that on a Saturday night shortly after Emmett had been taken on as songwriter for the Bryant's Minstrels, Jerry Bryant told him they would need a new walkaround by the following Monday. By this account, Emmett shut himself inside his <a href="/wiki/New_York_City.html" title="New York City">New York</a> flat and wrote the song that Sunday evening.<sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a  title="">[22]</a></sup></p>
<p>Other details emerge in later accounts. In one, Emmett claimed that "Suddenly, . . . I jumped up and sat down at the table to work. In less than an hour I had the first verse and chorus. After that it was easy."<sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a  title="">[23]</a></sup> In another version, Emmett stared out at the rainy evening and thought, "I wish I was in Dixie." Then, "Like a flash the thought suggested the first line of the walk-around, and a little later the minstrel, fiddle in hand, was working out the melody"<sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a  title="">[24]</a></sup> (a different story has it that Emmett's wife uttered the famous line).<sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a  title="">[25]</a></sup> Yet another variant, dated to 1903, further changes the details: "I was standing by the window, gazing out at the drizzly, raw day, and the old circus feeling came over me. I hummed the old refrain, 'I wish I was in Dixie,' and the inspiration struck me. I took my pen and in ten minutes had written the first verses with music. The remaining verses were easy."<sup id="_ref-24" class="reference"><a  title="">[26]</a></sup> In his final years, Emmett even claimed to have written the song years before he had moved to New York.<sup id="_ref-Sacks_and_Sacks_161_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[27]</a></sup> A <i><a href="/wiki/Washington_Post.html" title="Washington Post">Washington Post</a></i> article supports this, giving a composition date of 1843.<sup id="_ref-25" class="reference"><a  title="">[28]</a></sup></p>
<p>Emmett published "Dixie" (under the title "I Wish I Was in Dixie's Land") on <a href="/wiki/June_21.html" title="June 21">21 June</a> <a href="/wiki/1860.html" title="1860">1860</a> through <a href="/wiki/Firth%2C_Pond_%26_Company.html" title="Firth, Pond &amp; Company">Firth, Pond &amp; Co.</a> in New York. The original <a href="/wiki/Manuscript.html" title="Manuscript">manuscript</a> has been lost; extant copies were made during Emmett's retirement, starting in the 1890s.</p>
<p>Emmett's tardiness in <a href="/wiki/Copyright.html" title="Copyright">copyrighting</a> the song allowed it to proliferate among other minstrel groups and <a href="/wiki/Variety_show.html" title="Variety show">variety show</a> performers. Rival editions and variations multiplied in <a href="/wiki/Songbook.html" title="Songbook">songbooks</a>, <a href="/wiki/Newspaper.html" title="Newspaper">newspapers</a> and <a href="/wiki/Broadside.html" title="Broadside">broadsides</a>.

Other publishers attributed completely made-up composers with the song: "Jerry Blossom" and "Dixie, Jr.", among others. The most serious of these challenges during Emmett's lifetime came from Southerner <a href="/wiki/William_Shakespeare_Hays.html" title="William Shakespeare Hays">William Shakespeare Hays</a>; this claimant attempted to prove his allegations through a Southern historical society, but he died before they could produce any conclusive evidence. By 1908, four years after Emmett's death, no fewer than 37 people had claimed the song as theirs.<sup id="_ref-26" class="reference"><a  title="">[29]</a></sup></p>
<p>"Dixie" is the only song Emmett ever claimed to have written in a burst of inspiration, and analysis of Emmett's notes and writings shows "a meticulous copyist, [who] spent countless hours collecting and composing songs and sayings for the minstrel stage . . .&#160;; little evidence was left for the improvisational moment."<sup id="_ref-27" class="reference"><a  title="">[30]</a></sup> <i>The New York Clipper</i> wrote in 1872 that "[Emmett's] claim to authorship of 'Dixie' was and is still disputed, both in and out of the minstrel profession."<sup id="_ref-28" class="reference"><a  title="">[31]</a></sup>Emmett himself said, "Show people generally, if not always, have the chance to hear every local song as they pass through the different sections of [the] country, and particularly so with minstrel companies, who are always on the look out for songs and sayings that will answer their business."<sup id="_ref-29" class="reference"><a  title="">[32]</a></sup> He claimed at one point to have based the first part of "Dixie" on "Come Philander Let's Be Marchin, Every One for His True Love Searchin", which he described as a "song of his childhood days". Musical analysis does show some similarities in the <a href="/wiki/Melody.html" title="Melody">melodic</a> outline, but the songs are not closely related.<sup id="_ref-30" class="reference"><a  title="">[33]</a></sup> Emmett also credited "Dixie" to an old circus song.<sup id="_ref-Sacks_and_Sacks_161_1" class="reference"><a  title="">[27]</a></sup> Despite the disputed authorship, Firth, Pond &amp; Co. paid Emmett $300 for all rights to "Dixie" on <a href="/wiki/February_11.html" title="February 11">11 February</a> <a href="/wiki/1861.html" title="1861">1861</a>, perhaps fearing complications spurred by the impending Civil War.<sup id="_ref-31" class="reference"><a  title="">[34]</a></sup></p>

<h3>African American origin?</h3>
<p>On at least one occasion, Emmett attributed "Dixie" to an unnamed Southern black man,<sup id="_ref-Sacks_and_Sacks_161_2" class="reference"><a  title="">[27]</a></sup> and some of his contemporaries said that the song was based on an old <a href="/wiki/African_American_music.html" title="African American music">African American</a> <a href="/wiki/Folk_song.html" title="Folk song">folk tune</a>. Taken at face value, these claims are hardly surprising, as minstrels often billed themselves as authentic delineators of slave material. Names of these chance-met black songwriters were rarely given.</p>

<p>However, a <a href="/wiki/Mount_Vernon%2C_Ohio.html" title="Mount Vernon, Ohio">Mount Vernon</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ohio.html" title="Ohio">Ohio</a>, tradition, which dates to the 1910s or 1920s at the latest,<sup id="_ref-32" class="reference"><a  title="">[35]</a></sup> lends some credence to this notion. Many Mount Vernon residents claim that Emmett collaborated informally with a pair of black musicians named Ben and Lew Snowden. Those who remember the Snowden brothers describe them as "informal", "spontaneous", "creative", and "relatively free of concern over ownership" of their songs.<sup id="_ref-33" class="reference"><a  title="">[36]</a></sup> The Snowden brothers were part of the <a href="/wiki/Snowden_Family_Band.html" title="Snowden Family Band">Snowden Family Band</a>, which was well known for traveling about the region. That Emmett might have met and played with these local celebrities is hardly surprising. The story is well enough known that the grave marker for Ben and Lew Snowden, set in 1976 by the black <a href="/wiki/American_Legion.html" title="American Legion">American Legion</a> post, reads, "They taught 'Dixie' to Dan Emmett".<sup id="_ref-34" class="reference"><a  title="">[37]</a></sup></p>
<p>However, the Snowden theory has one serious hole. While Emmett likely did meet and play with Ben and Lew Snowden when he retired to <a href="/wiki/Knox_County%2C_Ohio.html" title="Knox County, Ohio">Knox County</a>, the Snowden brothers would have been only small children at the time Emmett composed "Dixie". Howard L. Sacks and Judith Sacks suggest that the Ohio legend may in fact be off by a generation, and that Emmett could have collaborated instead with the Snowden parents, Thomas and Ellen. This idea dates to at least 1978, in a genealogical history of the Robert Greer family of Knox County.<sup id="_ref-35" class="reference"><a  title="">[38]</a></sup></p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Circumstantial_evidence.html" title="Circumstantial evidence">Circumstantial evidence</a> suggests that this is possible. Emmett's grandparents owned the farm adjacent to the Snowden homestead, and Emmett's father was one of a few blacksmiths to whom Thomas Snowden could have brought his horses for shoeing. Furthermore, an unpublished biography of Emmett, written in 1935 by a friend of the Emmett family, Mary McClane, says that Emmett visited Mt. Vernon several times from 1835 until the 1860s and toured the surrounding area giving fiddle performances.<sup id="_ref-36" class="reference"><a  title="">[39]</a></sup> Emmett certainly refers to Knox County in other songs, including "<a href="/wiki/Seely_Simpkins_Jig.html" title="Seely Simpkins Jig">Seely Simpkins Jig</a>", which refers to a fiddler there, and "<a href="/wiki/Owl_Creek_Quickstep.html" title="Owl Creek Quickstep">Owl Creek Quickstep</a>", which is named for an early settlement in the area.<sup id="_ref-37" class="reference"><a  title="">[40]</a></sup></p>
<p>Advocates of the Snowden theory believe that the lyrics of "Dixie" are a protest through <a href="/wiki/Irony.html" title="Irony">irony</a> and parody against the institution of slavery. The references to "Cimmon seed an' sandy bottom" in one version of the song may refer to <a href="/wiki/Nanjemoy%2C_Maryland.html" title="Nanjemoy, Maryland">Nanjemoy</a>, <a href="/wiki/Maryland.html" title="Maryland">Maryland</a>, Ellen Snowden's birthplace, and located in an area that was known for its persimmons and sandy, wet lowlands.<sup id="_ref-38" class="reference"><a  title="">[41]</a></sup> Slaves rarely knew their exact birth date, instead recalling broad details that someone was born, for example, "Early on one frosty mornin'". A domestic slave, as Ellen Snowden had been, would have been well placed to witness a love affair between "Old Missus" and "Will-de-weaber". Food imagery, such as "buck-wheat cake" and "'Ingen' batter", further points to a writer who had some experience as a cook.<sup id="_ref-39" class="reference"><a  title="">[42]</a></sup></p>
<p>A 1950 article by Ada Bedell Wootton claims that Ben and Lew Snowden sometimes played with Dan Emmett during the minstrel's retirement.<sup id="_ref-40" class="reference"><a  title="">[43]</a></sup> At his death in 1923, Lew Snowden owned a small box of newspaper clippings asserting Emmett's authorship of "Dixie". He also had a small framed photograph of Emmett, a fixture on the Snowden house's wall for years, with the text "Author of 'Dixie'!" written under the minstrel's name. Nevertheless, many scholars, such as E. Lawrence Abel, dismiss the Snowden claims outright.<sup id="_ref-Abel_49_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[44]</a></sup></p>

It appeared second to last on the bill, perhaps an indication of the Bryants' lack of faith that the song could carry the minstrel show's entire finale.<sup id="_ref-41" class="reference"><a  title="">[45]</a></sup> The walkaround was billed as a "plantation song and dance".<sup id="_ref-42" class="reference"><a  title="">[46]</a></sup> It was a runaway success, and the Bryants quickly made it their standard closing number.</p>
<p>"Dixie" quickly gained wide recognition and status as a minstrel standard, and it helped rekindle interest in plantation material from other troupes, particularly in the third act. It became a favorite of <a href="/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln.html" title="Abraham Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln's</a> and was played during his campaign in 1860 and at his <a href="/wiki/Inauguration.html" title="Inauguration">inauguration</a> in 1861. The <i>New York Clipper</i> wrote that it was "one of the most popular compositions ever produced" and that it had "been sung, whistled, and played in every quarter of the globe."<sup id="_ref-43" class="reference"><a  title="">[47]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Buckley%27s_Serenaders.html" title="Buckley's Serenaders">Buckley's Serenaders</a> performed the song in <a href="/wiki/London.html" title="London">London</a> in late 1860, and by the end of the decade, it had found its way into the repertoire of British sailors. As the American Civil War broke out, one New Yorker wrote,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Dixie" has become an institution, an irrepressible institution in this section of the country . . . As a consequence, whenever "Dixie" is produced, the pen drops from the fingers of the plodding clerk, spectacles from the nose and the paper from the hands of the merchant, the needle from the nimble digits of the maid or matron, and all hands go hobbling, bobbling in time with the magical music of "Dixie."<sup id="_ref-44" class="reference"><a  title="">[48]</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The song even added a new term to the American lexicon: "Whistling 'Dixie'" is a <a href="/wiki/Slang.html" title="Slang">slang</a> expression meaning "[engaging] in unrealistically rosy fantasizing".<sup id="_ref-45" class="reference"><a  title="">[49]</a></sup> For example, "Don't just sit there whistling 'Dixie'!" is a reprimand against inaction, and "You ain't just whistling 'Dixie'!" indicates that the addressee is serious about the matter at hand.</p>
<p>The <a  class="new" title="Rumsey and Newcomb Minstrels">Rumsey and Newcomb Minstrels</a> brought "Dixie" to <a href="/wiki/New_Orleans%2C_Louisiana.html" title="New Orleans, Louisiana">New Orleans</a> in March 1860; the walkaround became the hit of their show. That April, <a href="/wiki/Mrs._John_Wood.html" title="Mrs. John Wood">Mrs. John Wood</a> sang "Dixie" in a <a href="/wiki/John_Brougham.html" title="John Brougham">John Brougham</a> <a href="/wiki/Burlesque.html" title="Burlesque">burlesque</a> called <i><a href="/wiki/Po-ca-hon-tas%2C_or_The_Gentle_Savage.html" title="Po-ca-hon-tas, or The Gentle Savage">Po-ca-hon-tas, or The Gentle Savage</a></i>, increasing the song's popularity in New Orleans. On the surface "Dixie" seems an unlikely candidate for a Southern hit; it has a Northern composer, stars a black protagonist, is intended as a dance song, and lacks any of the patriotic bluster of most national hymns and marches. Had it not been for the atmosphere of <a href="/wiki/Sectionalism.html" title="Sectionalism">sectionalism</a> in which "Dixie" debuted, it might have faded into obscurity.<sup id="_ref-46" class="reference"><a  title="">[50]</a></sup> Nevertheless, the refrain "In Dixie Land I'll took my stand / To lib an die in Dixie", coupled with the first verse and its sanguine picture of the South, hit a chord.

<p>New Orleans publisher <a href="/wiki/Philip_Werlein.html" title="Philip Werlein">P. P. Werlein</a> took advantage and published "Dixie" in New Orleans. He credited music to J. C.

Werlein's version, subtitled "Sung by Mrs. John Wood", was the first "Dixie" to do away with the faux Negro dialect and misspellings. The publication did not go unnoticed, and Firth Pond &amp; Co. threatened to sue.

<p>In May 1861 Confederate <a href="/wiki/Henry_Hotze.html" title="Henry Hotze">Henry Hotze</a> wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is marvellous with what wild-fire rapidity this tune "Dixie" has spread over the whole South.

<p>Southerners who shunned the song's low origins and comedic nature changed the lyrics, usually to focus on Southern pride and the war.<sup id="_ref-52" class="reference"><a  title="">[57]</a></sup> Albert Pike's enjoyed the most popularity; the <i>Natchez (Mississippi) Courier</i> published it on <a href="/wiki/May_30.html" title="May 30">30 May</a> <a href="/wiki/1861.html" title="1861">1861</a> as "The War Song of Dixie", followed by Werlein, who again credited Viereck for composition. <a href="/wiki/Henry_Throop_Stanton.html" title="Henry Throop Stanton">Henry Throop Stanton</a> published another war-themed "Dixie", which he dedicated to "the Boys in Virginia".<sup id="_ref-QuotedInAbel36_1" class="reference"><a  title="">[16]</a></sup> The defiant "In Dixie Land I'll take my stand / To live and die in Dixie" were the only lines used with any consistency.

<p>Southerners who rallied to the song proved reluctant to acknowledge a <a href="/wiki/Yankee.html" title="Yankee">Yankee</a> as its composer. Accordingly, some ascribed it a longer tradition as a folk song. Poet <a href="/wiki/John_Hill_Hewitt.html" title="John Hill Hewitt">John Hill Hewitt</a> wrote in 1862 that "The homely air of 'Dixie', of extremely doubtful origin . . .

<p>Meanwhile, many Northerners took offense to the South's appropriation of "Dixie". Before even the fall of <a href="/wiki/Fort_Sumter.html" title="Fort Sumter">Fort Sumter</a>, Frances J. Crosby published "Dixie for the Union" and "Dixie Unionized". The tune formed part of the repertoire of both Union <a href="/wiki/Band_%28music%29.html" title="Band (music)">bands</a> and common troops until 1863. Broadsides circulated with titles like "The Union 'Dixie'" or "The New Dixie, the True 'Dixie' for Northern Singers". Emmett himself arranged "Dixie" for the military in a book of <a href="/wiki/Fife_%28musical_instrument%29.html" title="Fife (musical instrument)">fife</a> instruction in 1862, and a 1904 work by Charles Burleigh Galbreath claims that Emmett gave his official sanction to Crosby's Union lyrics.<sup id="_ref-54" class="reference"><a  title="">[59]</a></sup></p>
<p>Northerners, Emmett among them, also declared that the "Dixie Land" of the song was actually in the North. One common story, still cited today, claimed that Dixie was a <a href="/wiki/Manhattan.html" title="Manhattan">Manhattan</a> slave owner who had sent his slaves south just before New York's 1827 banning of slavery. The stories had little effect; for most Americans "Dixie" was synonymous with the South.<sup id="_ref-55" class="reference"><a  title="">[60]</a></sup></p>

<p>"Dixie" slowly re-entered Northern repertoires, mostly in private performances. New Yorkers resurrected stories about "Dixie" being a part of Manhattan, thus reclaiming the song for themselves. The <i><a  class="new" title="New York Weekly">New York Weekly</a></i> wrote, "... no one ever heard of Dixie's land being other than Manhattan Island until recently, when it has been erroneously supposed to refer to the South, from its connection with pathetic negro allegory."<sup id="_ref-57" class="reference"><a  title="">[62]</a></sup> In 1888 the publishers of a <a href="/wiki/Boston%2C_Massachusetts.html" title="Boston, Massachusetts">Boston</a> songbook included "Dixie" as a "patriotic song", and in 1895 the <a href="/wiki/Confederate_Veterans%27_Association.html" title="Confederate Veterans' Association">Confederate Veterans' Association</a> suggested a celebration in honor of "Dixie" and Emmett in Washington as a bipartisan tribute. One of the planners noted that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In this era of peace between the sections . . . thousands of people from every portion of the United States will be only too glad to unite with the ex-confederates in the proposed demonstration, and already some of the leading men who fought on the Union side are enthusiastically in favor of carrying out the programme. Dixie is as lively and popular an air today as it ever was, and its reputation is not confined to the American continent . . . [W]herever it is played by a big, strong band the auditors cannot help keeping time to the music.<sup id="_ref-58" class="reference"><a  title="">[63]</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, "Dixie" was still most strongly associated with the South. Northern singers and writers often used it for parody or as a <a href="/wiki/Quotation.html" title="Quotation">quotation</a> in other pieces to establish a person or setting as Southern. For example, <a href="/wiki/African_American.html" title="African American">African Americans</a> <a href="/wiki/Eubie_Blake.html" title="Eubie Blake">Eubie Blake</a> and <a href="/wiki/Noble_Sissle.html" title="Noble Sissle">Noble Sissle</a> quoted "Dixie" in the song "Banana Days" for their 1921 <a href="/wiki/Musical_theatre.html" title="Musical theatre">musical</a> <i><a href="/wiki/Shuffle_Along.html" title="Shuffle Along">Shuffle Along</a></i>. In 1905 the <a href="/wiki/United_Daughters_of_the_Confederacy.html" title="United Daughters of the Confederacy">United Daughters of the Confederacy</a> mounted a campaign to acknowledge an official Southern version of the song (one that would purge it forever of its African American associations).<sup id="_ref-Abel_49_1" class="reference"><a  title="">[44]</a></sup> Although they obtained the support of the <a href="/wiki/United_Confederate_Veterans.html" title="United Confederate Veterans">United Confederate Veterans</a> and the <a href="/wiki/United_Sons_of_Confederate_Veterans.html" title="United Sons of Confederate Veterans">United Sons of Confederate Veterans</a>, Emmett's death the year before turned sentiments against the project, and the groups were ultimately unsuccessful in having any of the 22 entries universally adopted.</p>
<p>As African Americans entered minstrelsy, they exploited the song's popularity in the South by playing "Dixie" as they first arrived in a Southern town. According to <a href="/wiki/Tom_Fletcher.html" title="Tom Fletcher">Tom Fletcher</a>, a black minstrel of the time, it tended to please those who might otherwise be antagonistic to the arrival of a group of black men.<sup id="_ref-59" class="reference"><a  title="">[64]</a></sup></p>

<p>Still, "Dixie" was not rejected outright in the North. An article in the <i><a href="/wiki/New_York_Tribune.html" title="New York Tribune">New York Tribune</a></i>, c. 1908, said that "though 'Dixie' came to be looked upon as characteristically a song of the South, the hearts of the Northern people never grew cold to it. President Lincoln loved it, and to-day it is the most popular song in the country, irrespective of section."<sup id="_ref-60" class="reference"><a  title="">[65]</a></sup> As late as 1934, the music journal <i><a href="/wiki/The_Etude.html" title="The Etude">The Etude</a></i> asserted that "the sectional sentiment attached to <i>Dixie</i> has been long forgotten; and today it is heard everywhere—North, East, South, West."<sup id="_ref-61" class="reference"><a  title="">[66]</a></sup></p>
<p>"Dixie" had become Emmett's most enduring legacy. In the 1900 census of Knox County, Emmett's occupation is given as "author of Dixie".<sup id="_ref-62" class="reference"><a  title="">[67]</a></sup> The band at Emmett's funeral played "Dixie" as he was lowered into his grave. His grave marker, placed 20 years after his death, reads,</p>
<center>To the Memory of</center>
<center>Daniel Decatur Emmett</center>
<center>1815—1904</center>
<center>Whose Song 'Dixie Land' inspired the courage</center>
<center>and Devotion of the Southern People and now</center>
<center>Thrills the Hearts of a Reunited Nation.<sup id="_ref-63" class="reference"><a  title="">[68]</a></sup></center>

<h2>"Dixie" opposed</h2>
<p>Beginning in the <a href="/wiki/American_Civil_Rights_Movement_%281955-1968%29.html" title="American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968)">American Civil Rights Movement</a> in the 1950s and 1960s, however, African Americans have frequently challenged "Dixie" as a <a href="/wiki/Racism.html" title="Racism">racist</a> relic of the Confederacy and a reminder of decades of white domination and <a href="/wiki/Racial_segregation.html" title="Racial segregation">segregation</a>. These feelings were amplified when white opponents to civil rights began answering songs such as "<a href="/wiki/We_Shall_Overcome.html" title="We Shall Overcome">We Shall Overcome</a>" with the unofficial Confederate anthem.<sup id="_ref-64" class="reference"><a  title="">[69]</a></sup></p>
<p>The earliest of these protests came from students of Southern universities, where "Dixie" was a staple of a number of marching bands. In 1966 a student of the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Mississippi.html" title="University of Mississippi">University of Mississippi</a> named Irvin Walker noted, "Can you imagine what it's like to have all these white people stand up around you for the song, and you stay sitting there, a Negro?" His classmate, Earnest Watson, added, "I feel like standing up for the song if I'm a student. But you got to realize what it means to most of them. Sure, I wish they'd have some <a href="/wiki/Fight_song.html" title="Fight song">fight song</a> I could stand up and cheer for. But not 'Dixie,' man. Not that one. That's the worst thing about going to the games. If they wouldn't play 'Dixie' so much, it'd be O.K."<sup id="_ref-65" class="reference"><a  title="">[70]</a></sup> In 1967 black cadets at <a href="/wiki/The_Citadel_%28Military_College%29.html" title="The Citadel (Military College)">The Citadel</a> refused to stand for "Dixie" or to sing and perform it at football games. Similar protests have since occurred at the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Virginia.html" title="University of Virginia">University of Virginia</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Georgia_Institute_of_Technology.html" title="Georgia Institute of Technology">Georgia Institute of Technology</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Tulane_University.html" title="Tulane University">Tulane University</a>. In 2002, the University of Mississippi's vice chancellors attempted to compromise by adding more general American pieces to the band's playlist and by restricting the playing of "Dixie" to twice per game.</p>
<p>The debate has since moved beyond student populations. Members of the 75th <a href="/wiki/United_States_Army_Band.html" title="United States Army Band">United States Army Band</a> protested "Dixie" in 1971. In 1989 three black Georgia senators walked out when the Miss Georgia Sweet Potato Queen sang "Dixie" in the Georgia chamber. Meanwhile, many black musicologists have challenged the song's racist origins. For example, Sam Dennison writes that "Today, the performance of 'Dixie' still conjures visions of an unrepentant, militarily recalcitrant South, ready to reassert its aged theories of white supremacy at any moment . . . This is why the playing of 'Dixie' still causes hostile reactions."<sup id="_ref-66" class="reference"><a  title="">[71]</a></sup></p>
<p>On the other hand, for many Southerners, "Dixie", like the <a href="/wiki/Confederate_flag.html" title="Confederate flag">Confederate flag</a>, is a symbol of Southern heritage and identity.<sup id="_ref-67" class="reference"><a  title="">[72]</a></sup> Others consider the song a part of the patriotic American repertoire on a par with "<a href="/wiki/America_the_Beautiful.html" title="America the Beautiful">America the Beautiful</a>" and "<a href="/wiki/Yankee_Doodle.html" title="Yankee Doodle">Yankee Doodle</a>". For example, Chief Justice <a href="/wiki/William_Rehnquist.html" title="William Rehnquist">William Rehnquist</a> regularly included "Dixie" in his annual <a  class="new" title="Sing-along">sing-along</a> for the 4th Circuit Judicial Conference in <a href="/wiki/Virginia.html" title="Virginia">Virginia</a>. However, its performance prompted some African American lawyers to avoid the event. White lawyer George C. Freeman, Jr., who attended Rehnquist's June 1999 gathering, defended the song: "I think all that stuff about reliving history is overblown . . . I really think that the past is the past."<sup id="_ref-68" class="reference"><a  title="">[73]</a></sup></p>
<p>Performers who choose to sing "Dixie" today usually remove the faux dialect and combine the song with other pieces. For example, <a  class="new" title="Rene Marie">Rene Marie's</a> jazz version mixes "Dixie" with "<a href="/wiki/Strange_Fruit.html" title="Strange Fruit">Strange Fruit</a>", a <a href="/wiki/Billie_Holiday.html" title="Billie Holiday">Billie Holiday</a> song about a <a href="/wiki/Lynching.html" title="Lynching">lynching</a>. <a href="/wiki/Mickey_Newbury.html" title="Mickey Newbury">Mickey Newbury's</a> "<a href="/wiki/An_American_Trilogy.html" title="An American Trilogy">An American Trilogy</a>" (often performed by <a href="/wiki/Elvis_Presley.html" title="Elvis Presley">Elvis Presley</a>) combines "Dixie" with the Union's "<a href="/wiki/Battle_Hymn_of_the_Republic.html" title="Battle Hymn of the Republic">Battle Hymn of the Republic</a>" and the African American spiritual "<a href="/wiki/All_My_Trials.html" title="All My Trials">All My Trials</a>".</p>
<p>However, in modern times "Dixie" is usually heard as an instrumental piece. Thus, to countless people "Dixie" signifies nothing more than "Southern United States".<sup id="_ref-Sacks_and_Sacks_159_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[74]</a></sup> This interpretation has been reinforced through years of <a href="/wiki/American_popular_culture.html" title="American popular culture">American popular culture</a>. For example, the soundtracks of cartoons featuring Southern characters like <a href="/wiki/Foghorn_Leghorn.html" title="Foghorn Leghorn">Foghorn Leghorn</a> often play "Dixie" to quickly set the scene. On the television series <i><a href="/wiki/The_Dukes_of_Hazzard.html" title="The Dukes of Hazzard">The Dukes of Hazzard</a></i>, which takes place in <a href="/wiki/Georgia_%28U.S._state%29.html" title="Georgia (U.S. state)">Georgia</a>, the car horn of the <a href="/wiki/General_Lee_%28car%29.html" title="General Lee (car)">General Lee</a> plays part of the melody from the song. Sacks and Sacks argue that such apparently innocent associations only further serve to tie "Dixie" to its blackface origins, as these comedic programs are, like the minstrel show, "inelegant, parodic [and] dialect-ridden".<sup id="_ref-Sacks_and_Sacks_159_1" class="reference"><a  title="">[74]</a></sup> However, "Dixie" signals "Southern" in more serious fare, as well. <a href="/wiki/Ken_Burns.html" title="Ken Burns">Ken Burns</a> makes use of instrumental versions in his <i><a href="/wiki/The_Civil_War_%28documentary%29.html" title="The Civil War (documentary)">Civil War</a></i> documentary, for example.</p>
