<p><b>Bodyline</b>, also known as <i>Fast Leg Theory</i>, was a <a href="/wiki/Cricket.html" title="Cricket">cricketing</a> tactic devised by the <a href="/wiki/English_cricket_team.html" title="English cricket team">English cricket team</a> for their 1932–33 tour of <a href="/wiki/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australia</a>, specifically to combat the extraordinary <a href="/wiki/Batting_%28cricket%29.html" title="Batting (cricket)">batting</a> skill of Australia's <a href="/wiki/Don_Bradman.html" title="Don Bradman">Don Bradman</a>. Bodyline <a href="/wiki/Bowler_%28cricket%29.html" title="Bowler (cricket)">bowlers</a> deliberately aimed the <a href="/wiki/Cricket_ball.html" title="Cricket ball">cricket ball</a> at the bodies of <a href="/wiki/Batsman.html" title="Batsman">batsmen</a>, in the hope of creating legside deflections that could be caught by one of several fielders located in the quadrant of the field behind square leg.</p>
<p>This tactic caused several injuries to Australian players and led to ill feeling between the two national teams. The controversy eventually spilled into the diplomatic arena. Over the next two decades, several laws of cricket were changed to prevent this kind of tactic being used again.</p>

<h2>Genesis of Bodyline</h2>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Australian_cricket_team.html" title="Australian cricket team">Australian cricket team</a> toured <a href="/wiki/England.html" title="England">England</a> in <a href="/wiki/1930_in_sports.html" title="1930 in sports">1930</a>. Australia won the five-<a href="/wiki/Test_cricket.html" title="Test cricket">Test</a> series 2-1, with Don Bradman scoring an astounding 974 <a href="/wiki/Run_%28cricket%29.html" title="Run (cricket)">runs</a> at a <a href="/wiki/Batting_average.html" title="Batting average">batting average</a> of 139.14, an aggregate record that stands to this day.</p>
<p>After the series, <a href="/wiki/Douglas_Jardine.html" title="Douglas Jardine">Douglas Jardine</a> – who was later appointed England's captain for the 1932–33 English tour of Australia – devised a plan with <a href="/wiki/Nottinghamshire.html" title="Nottinghamshire">Nottinghamshire</a> captain <a href="/wiki/Arthur_Carr.html" title="Arthur Carr">Arthur Carr</a> and his two <a href="/wiki/Fast_bowling.html" title="Fast bowling">fast bowlers</a> <a href="/wiki/Harold_Larwood.html" title="Harold Larwood">Harold Larwood</a> and <a href="/wiki/Bill_Voce.html" title="Bill Voce">Bill Voce</a> to combat Bradman's extraordinary skills. At a meeting in <a href="/wiki/London.html" title="London">London</a>'s Piccadilly Hotel, the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Oxford.html" title="University of Oxford">Oxford</a>-educated Jardine asked Larwood and Voce if they could bowl on leg <a href="/wiki/Stump_%28cricket%29.html" title="Stump (cricket)">stump</a> and make the ball come up into the body of the batsman. The bowlers agreed they could, and that it might prove effective.</p>
<p>Accompanying this <a href="/wiki/Line_and_length.html" title="Line and length">bowling line</a> would be a cordon of close <a href="/wiki/Fielding_%28cricket%29.html" title="Fielding (cricket)">fielders</a> set on the <a href="/wiki/Leg_side.html" title="Leg side">leg side</a>. The result was that the batsman had to choose to either take evasive action from balls aimed at his body and head, or attempt to fend the ball away with the <a href="/wiki/Cricket_bat.html" title="Cricket bat">bat</a>, possibly giving catching chances to the close-set leg side field.</p>
<p>Larwood and Voce practised the plan over the next two seasons of English <a href="/wiki/County_cricket.html" title="County cricket">county cricket</a>, terrorising their opponents as Nottinghamshire finished near the top of the competition each year. By the time the English team left for Australia in October <a href="/wiki/1932_in_sports.html" title="1932 in sports">1932</a>, Larwood and Voce, along with Bill Bowes from <a href="/wiki/Yorkshire.html" title="Yorkshire">Yorkshire</a>, had perfected their attack.</p>

<p><a name="The_1932.E2.80.9333_English_tour" id="The_1932.E2.80.9333_English_tour"></a></p>
<h2>The 1932–33 English tour</h2>
<p>The English players first tried their tactic in a <a href="/wiki/First-class_cricket.html" title="First-class cricket">first-class</a> tour match against an Australian XI in <a href="/wiki/Perth%2C_Western_Australia.html" title="Perth, Western Australia">Perth</a>, a game in which Jardine rested and gave the captaincy duties to his deputy <a href="/wiki/Bob_Wyatt.html" title="Bob Wyatt">Bob Wyatt</a>. Seeing the bruising balls hit the Australian batsmen on several occasions in this game and the next angered the spectators.</p>
<p>The English players and management were consistent in referring to their tactic as <i>fast leg theory</i> because they considered it to be a variant of the established — and relatively harmless — <a href="/wiki/Leg_theory.html" title="Leg theory">leg theory</a> tactic. The Australian press came up with the far more evocative and inflammatory term, <i>Bodyline</i> (<a  title="">see below</a>). The reporting of the series in England described the tactic as <i>fast leg theory</i>, which caused serious misunderstandings, as neither the English public nor the Board of the <a href="/wiki/Marylebone_Cricket_Club.html" title="Marylebone Cricket Club">Marylebone Cricket Club</a> (MCC) — the governing body of English cricket — could understand why the Australians were complaining about a commonly used tactic and came to the conclusion that the Australian cricket authorities and public were sore losers and "squealers".</p>
<p>In the Test matches, Bradman countered Bodyline by moving toward the leg side, away from the line of the ball, and cutting it into the vacant <a href="/wiki/Off_side.html" title="Off side">off side</a> field. Whilst this was dubious in terms of <a href="/wiki/Batting_%28cricket%29.html" title="Batting (cricket)">batting technique</a>, it seemed the best way to cope with the barrage, and Bradman <a href="/wiki/Batting_average.html" title="Batting average">averaged</a> a creditable 56.57 in the series (compared to his career average of 99.94), while being struck above the waist by the ball only once. His team-mates fared worse, performing poorly and taking many hits on the body.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>Whilst moderately successful as a tactic (England regained <a href="/wiki/The_Ashes.html" title="The Ashes">The Ashes</a> with a 4-1 margin), the Australian crowds abhorred Bodyline as vicious and unsporting. Matters came to a head in the third Test at <a href="/wiki/Adelaide.html" title="Adelaide">Adelaide</a>, when Larwood struck Australian captain <a href="/wiki/Bill_Woodfull.html" title="Bill Woodfull">Bill Woodfull</a> above the heart and fractured <a href="/wiki/Wicket-keeper.html" title="Wicket-keeper">wicket-keeper</a> <a href="/wiki/Bert_Oldfield.html" title="Bert Oldfield">Bert Oldfield</a>'s skull (although this was from a top <a href="/wiki/List_of_cricket_terms#E.html" title="List of cricket terms">edge</a>). Tension and feelings ran so high that a riot was narrowly averted as police stationed themselves between the players and enraged spectators. However, at the time England were not using the Bodyline tactics. Woodfull was struck when he was bent over his bat and wicket – and not when upright as often imagined. The crowd was incensed, and popular imagination blurred, when Jardine ordered his team to move to Bodyline positions immediately after Woodfull's injury.</p>
<p>In a famous quotation, Bill Woodfull said to the England tour manager <a href="/wiki/Plum_Warner.html" title="Plum Warner">Pelham Warner</a>, when the latter came to express his sympathy for Woodfull's injury: "I don't want to see you, Mr Warner. There are two teams out there. One is trying to play cricket and the other is not."</p>
<p>At the end of the fourth day's play the <a href="/wiki/Cricket_Australia.html" title="Cricket Australia">Australian Board of Control for Cricket</a> sent the following cable to the MCC in <a href="/wiki/London.html" title="London">London</a>:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Bodyline bowling assumed such proportions as to menace best interests of game, making protection of body by batsmen the main consideration. Causing intensely bitter feeling between players as well as injury. In our opinion is unsportsmanlike. Unless stopped at once likely to upset friendly relations existing between Australia and England.</i></dd>

Bert Oldfield staggers away with his skull fractured.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>This escalated into a diplomatic incident between the countries as the MCC — supported by the British public and still under the impression that their <i>fast leg theory</i> tactic was harmless — took serious offence at being branded "unsportsmanlike" and demanded a retraction. With <a href="/wiki/World_War_I.html" title="World War I">World War I</a> still fresh in people's memories and the first rumblings of <a href="/wiki/World_War_II.html" title="World War II">World War II</a> beginning, many people saw Bodyline as fracturing an international relationship that needed to remain strong.</p>
<p>Jardine, and by extension the entire English team, threatened to withdraw from the fourth and fifth Tests unless the Australian Board withdrew the accusation of unsporting behaviour. Public reaction in both England and Australia was outrage directed at the other nation. The <a href="/wiki/Governors_of_South_Australia.html" title="Governors of South Australia">Governor</a> of <a href="/wiki/South_Australia.html" title="South Australia">South Australia</a>, <a href="/wiki/Alexander_Hore-Ruthven%2C_1st_Earl_of_Gowrie.html" title="Alexander Hore-Ruthven, 1st Earl of Gowrie">Alexander Hore-Ruthven</a>, who was in England at the time, expressed his concern to British <a href="/wiki/Secretary_of_State_for_Dominion_Affairs.html" title="Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs">Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs</a> <a href="/wiki/James_Henry_Thomas.html" title="James Henry Thomas">James Henry Thomas</a> that this would cause a significant impact on trade between the nations.</p>
<p>The standoff was settled only when <a href="/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Australia.html" title="Prime Minister of Australia">Australian Prime Minister</a> <a href="/wiki/Joseph_Lyons.html" title="Joseph Lyons">Joseph Lyons</a> met with members of the Australian Board and outlined to them the severe economic hardships that could be caused in Australia if the British public boycotted Australian trade. Given this understanding, the Board withdrew the allegation of unsportsmanlike behaviour two days before the fourth Test, thus saving the tour.</p>
<p>The English team continued to bowl Bodyline in the remaining two Tests, but slower pitches meant the Australians, although frequently bruised, sustained no further serious injuries.</p>

<h2>Bodyline in England</h2>
<p>Bodyline continued to be bowled occasionally in the 1933 English season — most notably by <a href="/wiki/Nottinghamshire_County_Cricket_Club.html" title="Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club">Nottinghamshire</a>, who had Carr, Voce and Larwood in their team. This gave the English crowds their first chance to see what all the fuss was about. Farnes, the <a href="/wiki/Cambridge_University_Cricket_Club.html" title="Cambridge University Cricket Club">Cambridge University</a> fast bowler also bowled it in the university match, hitting a few <a href="/wiki/Oxford_University_Cricket_Club.html" title="Oxford University Cricket Club">Oxford</a> batsmen.</p>
<p>Jardine himself had to face bodyline bowling in a Test match. The <a href="/wiki/West_Indian_cricket_team.html" title="West Indian cricket team">West Indian cricket team</a> toured England in 1933, and, in the second Test at <a href="/wiki/Old_Trafford_%28cricket%29.html" title="Old Trafford (cricket)">Old Trafford</a>, <a href="/wiki/Jackie_Grant.html" title="Jackie Grant">Jackie Grant</a>, their captain, decided to try bodyline. He had a couple of fast bowlers, <a href="/wiki/Manny_Martindale.html" title="Manny Martindale">Manny Martindale</a> and <a href="/wiki/Learie_Constantine.html" title="Learie Constantine">Learie Constantine</a>. Facing bodyline tactics for the first time, England first suffered, falling to 134 for 4, with <a href="/wiki/Wally_Hammond.html" title="Wally Hammond">Wally Hammond</a> being hit on the chin, though he recovered to continue his innings. Then Jardine himself faced Martindale and Constantine. Jardine never flinched. He played right back to the bouncers, standing on tiptoe, and, no doubt partly because he didn't care for the <a href="/wiki/Batting_%28cricket%29.html" title="Batting (cricket)">hook shot</a>, played them with a dead bat. Whilst the Old Trafford pitch was not as suited to bodyline as the hard Australian wickets, Martindale did take 5 for 73, but Constantine only took 1 for 55. Jardine himself made 127, his only Test century.</p>
<p>In the second West Indian innings, Clark bowled bodyline back to the West Indians, taking 2 for 64. <a  class="external text" title="http://www.cricinfo.com/link_to_database/ARCHIVE/1930S/1933/WI_IN_ENG/WI_ENG_T2_22-25JUL1933.html">The match</a> in the end was drawn; it was also the highest-profile game in which bodyline was bowled in England.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Origin of the term &quot;Bodyline&quot;">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Origin_of_the_term_.22Bodyline.22" id="Origin_of_the_term_.22Bodyline.22"></a></p>
<h2>Origin of the term "Bodyline"</h2>
<p>In 1932, <a href="/wiki/Sydney%2C_Australia.html" title="Sydney, Australia">Sydney</a> journalist <a  class="new" title="Hugh Buggy">Hugh Buggy</a> who worked for <i>The Sun</i>, and who happened to be a colleague of <a href="/wiki/Jack_Fingleton.html" title="Jack Fingleton">Jack Fingleton</a>, sent a telegram to his newspaper from the Test after a day's play. As a substitute for "in the line of the body" he used the term "bodyline", to keep the cost down.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Changes to the laws of cricket">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Changes_to_the_laws_of_cricket" id="Changes_to_the_laws_of_cricket"></a></p>
<h2>Changes to the laws of cricket</h2>
<p>As a direct consequence of the 1932–33 tour, the MCC introduced a new rule to the <a href="/wiki/Laws_of_cricket.html" title="Laws of cricket">laws of cricket</a> in 1934. Specifically, <a href="/wiki/Umpire_%28cricket%29.html" title="Umpire (cricket)">umpires</a> were now given the power — and the responsibility — to intervene if they considered a bowler was deliberately aiming at a batsman with intent to injure.</p>
<p>Some 25 years later, another rule was introduced banning the placement of more than two fielders in the quadrant of the field behind square leg. Although this rule was not principally intended to prevent leg theory, it diluted the potency of short-pitched leg theory, as it allowed for fewer catching positions on the leg side.</p>
<p>Later law changes, under the heading of "Intimidatory Short Pitched Bowling", also restricted the number of "<a href="/wiki/Bouncer_%28cricket%29.html" title="Bouncer (cricket)">bouncers</a>" which may be bowled in an <a href="/wiki/Over_%28cricket%29.html" title="Over (cricket)">over</a>. Nevertheless, the tactic of intimidating the batsman is still used to an extent that would have been shocking in 1933, although it is less dangerous now because today's players wear helmets and generally far more protective gear. The <a href="/wiki/West_Indian_cricket_team.html" title="West Indian cricket team">West Indies teams</a> of the 1980s, which regularly fielded a bowling attack comprising some of the best fast bowlers in cricket history, were perhaps the most feared exponents.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Cultural impact of Bodyline">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Cultural_impact_of_Bodyline" id="Cultural_impact_of_Bodyline"></a></p>
<h2>Cultural impact of Bodyline</h2>
<p>Following the 1932–33 series, several authors – including many of the players involved – released books expressing various points of view about Bodyline. Many argued that it was a scourge on cricket and must be stamped out, while some did not see what all the fuss was about.</p>
<p>The MCC asked <a href="/wiki/Harold_Larwood.html" title="Harold Larwood">Harold Larwood</a> to sign an apology to them for his bowling in Australia, making his selection for England again conditional upon it. Larwood was furious at the notion, pointing out that he had been following orders from his upper-class captain, and that was where any blame should lie. Larwood never played for England again, and became vilified in his own country. In retrospect, this event is seen by many as the first step in breaking down the class distinction in English cricket.</p>
<p>Outside the sport, there were significant consequences for Anglo-Australian relations, which remained strained, until the outbreak of World War II made cooperation paramount. Business between the two countries was adversely affected as citizens of each country displayed a preference for not buying goods manufactured in the other. Australian commerce also suffered in British colonies in Asia: the <i>North China Daily News</i> published a pro-Bodyline editorial, denouncing Australians as sore losers. An Australian journalist reported that several business deals in <a href="/wiki/Hong_Kong.html" title="Hong Kong">Hong Kong</a> and <a href="/wiki/Shanghai.html" title="Shanghai">Shanghai</a> were lost by Australians because of local reactions.</p>
<p>English immigrants in Australia found themselves shunned and persecuted by locals, and Australian visitors to England were treated similarly. Some years later a statue of <a href="/wiki/Prince_Albert_of_Saxe-Coburg-Gotha.html" title="Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha">Prince Albert</a> in <a href="/wiki/Sydney.html" title="Sydney">Sydney</a> was vandalised, with an ear being knocked off and the word "BODYLINE" painted on it.</p>

<p>Both before and after World War II, numerous satirical cartoons and comedy skits were written, mostly in Australia, based on events of the Bodyline tour. Generally, they poked fun at the English.</p>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/1984_in_television.html" title="1984 in television">1984</a>, Australia's <a href="/wiki/Network_Ten.html" title="Network Ten">Network Ten</a> produced a television miniseries titled <i>Bodyline: It's Just Not Cricket</i>, dramatising the events of the 1932–33 English tour of Australia. It starred <a href="/wiki/Gary_Sweet.html" title="Gary Sweet">Gary Sweet</a> as Don Bradman and <a href="/wiki/Hugo_Weaving.html" title="Hugo Weaving">Hugo Weaving</a> as Douglas Jardine. The series took some liberties with historical accuracy for the sake of drama, including a depiction of angry Australian fans burning an English flag at the Adelaide Test, an event which was never documented. Larwood, having emigrated to Australia in 1950 to escape ongoing vilification in England, received several threatening and obscene phone calls after the series aired.</p>
<p>To this day, the Bodyline tour remains one of the most significant events in the <a href="/wiki/History_of_cricket.html" title="History of cricket">history of cricket</a>, and strong in the consciousness of many cricket followers. In a poll of cricket journalists, commentators, and players in <a href="/wiki/2004_in_sports.html" title="2004 in sports">2004</a>, the Bodyline tour was ranked the most important event in cricket history.</p>
