The success of Rejewski and his colleagues jump-started <a href="/wiki/Great_Britain.html" title="Great Britain">British</a> reading of Enigma in <a href="/wiki/World_War_II.html" title="World War II">World War II</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/Military_espionage.html" title="Military espionage">intelligence</a> so gained, code-named "<a href="/wiki/ULTRA.html" title="ULTRA">Ultra</a>", contributed, perhaps decisively, to the <a href="/wiki/End_of_World_War_II_in_Europe.html" title="End of World War II in Europe">defeat of Nazi Germany</a><sup><a  title="">(Note 1)</a></sup>.</p>
<p>While studying mathematics at <a href="/wiki/Pozna%C5%84_University.html" title="Poznań University">Poznań University</a>, Rejewski attended a secret <a href="/wiki/Cryptology.html" title="Cryptology">cryptology</a> course conducted by the Polish <a href="/wiki/General_Staff.html" title="General Staff">General Staff</a>'s <a href="/wiki/Biuro_Szyfr%C3%B3w.html" title="Biuro Szyfrów">Cipher Bureau</a>, which he joined full-time in 1932. The Bureau had achieved little success reading Enigma and set Rejewski to work on the problem in late 1932. After only a few weeks, he had deduced the secret internal wiring of the Enigma. Rejewski and two mathematician colleagues then developed an assortment of techniques for the regular <a href="/wiki/Decryption.html" title="Decryption">decryption</a> of Enigma messages. Rejewski's contributions included devising the cryptologic "<a href="/wiki/Card_catalog_%28cryptology%29.html" title="Card catalog (cryptology)">card catalog</a>", derived using his "<a href="/wiki/Cyclometer.html" title="Cyclometer">cyclometer</a>", and the "<a href="/wiki/Bomba_%28cryptography%29.html" title="Bomba (cryptography)">bomba</a>".</p>
<p>Five weeks before the <a href="/wiki/Polish_September_Campaign.html" title="Polish September Campaign">German invasion of Poland</a> in 1939, Rejewski and his colleagues presented their results on Enigma decryption to <a href="/wiki/France.html" title="France">French</a> and <a href="/wiki/Great_Britain.html" title="Great Britain">British</a> <a href="/wiki/Military_espionage.html" title="Military espionage">intelligence</a> representatives. Shortly after the outbreak of war, the Polish cryptologists were evacuated to <a href="/wiki/France.html" title="France">France</a>, where they continued their work in collaboration with the British and French. They were again compelled to evacuate after the <a href="/wiki/Fall_of_France.html" title="Fall of France">fall of France</a> in June 1940, but within months returned to work undercover in <a href="/wiki/Vichy_France.html" title="Vichy France">Vichy France</a>. After the country was fully occupied by Germany in November 1942, Rejewski and fellow mathematician <a href="/wiki/Henryk_Zygalski.html" title="Henryk Zygalski">Henryk Zygalski</a> fled via Spain to Britain. There they worked at a Polish Army unit, solving low-level German ciphers. In 1946 Rejewski returned to his family in Poland and worked as an accountant, remaining silent about his cryptologic work until 1967.</p>

<p>Marian Rejewski was born <a href="/wiki/August_16.html" title="August 16">August 16</a>, <a href="/wiki/1905.html" title="1905">1905</a>, in <a href="/wiki/Bydgoszcz.html" title="Bydgoszcz">Bydgoszcz</a>.<sup><a  title="">(Note 2)</a></sup> His parents were Józef, a <a href="/wiki/Cigar.html" title="Cigar">cigar</a> merchant, and Matylda, née Thoms. He attended a German-speaking <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Königliches Gymnasium zu Bromberg</span></i> (Royal Grammar School in <a href="/wiki/Bydgoszcz.html" title="Bydgoszcz">Bydgoszcz</a>) and completed high school with his <i><span lang="pl" xml:lang="pl"><a href="/wiki/Matura.html" title="Matura">matura</a></span></i> in 1923. Rejewski then studied <a href="/wiki/Mathematics.html" title="Mathematics">mathematics</a> at <a href="/wiki/Adam_Mickiewicz_University_in_Pozna%C5%84.html" title="Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznań">Poznań University</a>, graduating on <a href="/wiki/March_1.html" title="March 1">March 1</a>, <a href="/wiki/1929.html" title="1929">1929</a>.</p>
<p>In early 1929, shortly before he graduated, Rejewski started attending a secret cryptology course organized for selected German-speaking mathematics students by the Polish General Staff's <a href="/wiki/Biuro_Szyfr%C3%B3w.html" title="Biuro Szyfrów">Cipher Bureau</a> (<i><span lang="pl" xml:lang="pl">Biuro Szyfrów</span></i>). Rejewski and fellow students <a href="/wiki/Henryk_Zygalski.html" title="Henryk Zygalski">Henryk Zygalski</a> and <a href="/wiki/Jerzy_R%C3%B3%C5%BCycki.html" title="Jerzy Różycki">Jerzy Różycki</a> were among the few who could keep up with the course while balancing the demands of their normal studies. Rejewski graduated with a master's degree in mathematics on <a href="/wiki/March_1.html" title="March 1">1 March</a> 1929; his thesis was titled "Theory of double periodic functions of the second and third kind and its applications". He began the first year of a two-year <a href="/wiki/Actuary.html" title="Actuary">actuarial statistics</a> course at <a href="/wiki/G%C3%B6ttingen.html" title="Göttingen">Göttingen</a>, Germany, which he was not to complete, for, while home for the summer in 1930, Rejewski accepted an offer of a mathematics teaching assistantship at Poznań University. At the same time, he also began working part-time for the Cipher Bureau, which had by then concluded the cryptology course and had set up an outpost at Poznań to decrypt intercepted German <a href="/wiki/Radio.html" title="Radio">radio</a> messages. Rejewski worked some twelve hours a week near the Mathematics Institute in an underground vault referred to as the "Black Chamber".<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a  title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>In the summer of 1932, the Poznań branch of the Cipher Bureau was disbanded. On <a href="/wiki/September_1.html" title="September 1">September 1</a>, <a href="/wiki/1932.html" title="1932">1932</a>, as a civilian employee, Rejewski joined the Cipher Bureau at the General Staff building (<a href="/wiki/Pa%C5%82ac_Saski.html" title="Pałac Saski">the Saxon Palace</a>) in <a href="/wiki/Warsaw.html" title="Warsaw">Warsaw</a>, as did Zygalski and Różycki. Their first assignment was to work out a four-letter <a href="/wiki/Code_%28cryptography%29.html" title="Code (cryptography)">code</a> used by the <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><a href="/wiki/Kriegsmarine.html" title="Kriegsmarine">Kriegsmarine</a></span></i>, the German Navy. Progress on solving this system was initially slow, but sped up considerably after a coded message exchange was received—a short test signal apparently in the form of a question and answer. The cryptologists guessed correctly that the question was, "When was <a href="/wiki/Frederick_the_Great.html" title="Frederick the Great">Frederick the Great</a> born?"<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a  title="">[2]</a></sup></p>

<h2>The Enigma machine</h2>
<p>In October 1932, while work on the Naval code was still underway, Rejewski was set to work, alone and in secret, on the output of the new standard German cipher machine, the <a href="/wiki/Enigma_machine.html" title="Enigma machine">Enigma</a> I, which was coming into widespread use. While the Cipher Bureau had, by later report, succeeded in solving an earlier, plugboard-less Enigma<sup><a  title="">(Note 3)</a></sup>, it had had no success with the Enigma I<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a  title="">[3]</a></sup>.</p>
<div class="thumb tright">

The <a href="/wiki/Enigma_machine.html" title="Enigma machine">Enigma machine</a>, solved by Rejewski in 1932, was widely used by Germany's military services to secure their communications.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The Enigma machine was an <a href="/wiki/Electromechanical.html" title="Electromechanical">electromechanical</a> device, equipped with a 26-letter <a href="/wiki/Typewriter_keyboard.html" title="Typewriter keyboard">keyboard</a> and a set of 26 lamps, corresponding to the letters of the <a href="/wiki/Latin_alphabet.html" title="Latin alphabet">alphabet</a>. Inside was a set of wired drums ("<a href="/wiki/Rotor_machine.html" title="Rotor machine">rotors</a>" and a "<a href="/wiki/Reflector_%28cipher_machine%29.html" title="Reflector (cipher machine)">reflector</a>") which scrambled the input. The machine also featured a <a href="/wiki/Plugboard.html" title="Plugboard">plugboard</a> to swap pairs of letters. To encipher a letter, the operator pushed the relevant key and noted down which of the lamps lit. Each key press caused one or more rotors to advance, and thus the encipherment varied from one key press to the next. In order for two operators to communicate, both Enigma machines had to be set up in exactly the same way. The large number of possibilities for setting the rotors and the plugboard combined to form an astronomical number of configurations, each of which would produce a different cipher. The settings were changed daily, with the consequence that the machine had to be "broken" anew each day if the messages were to be read continually.</p>
<p>To decrypt Enigma messages, three pieces of information were needed:</p>
<ol>
<li>A general understanding of how Enigma functioned</li>
<li>The wiring of the rotors</li>
<li>The daily settings: the sequence and orientations of the rotors (of which there were three initially), and the plug connections on the plugboard</li>
</ol>
<p>Rejewski had only the first at his disposal, based on information already acquired by the Cipher Bureau<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a  title="">[4]</a></sup>.</p>

A <a href="/wiki/Cycle_%28mathematics%29.html" title="Cycle (mathematics)">cycle</a> formed by the first and fourth letters of a set of indicators. Rejewski exploited these cycles to deduce the Enigma rotor wiring in 1932, and thereafter to solve the daily message settings.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>First, Rejewski tackled the problem of finding the wiring of the rotors. To do this, he pioneered the use of <a href="/wiki/Pure_mathematics.html" title="Pure mathematics">pure mathematics</a> in <a href="/wiki/Cryptanalysis.html" title="Cryptanalysis">cryptanalysis</a>. Previous methods had largely exploited <a href="/wiki/Linguistics.html" title="Linguistics">linguistic patterns</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Statistics.html" title="Statistics">statistics</a> of <a href="/wiki/Natural_language.html" title="Natural language">natural-language</a> texts — <a href="/wiki/Frequency_analysis.html" title="Frequency analysis">letter-frequency analysis</a>. Rejewski, however, applied techniques from <a href="/wiki/Group_theory.html" title="Group theory">group theory</a> — <a href="/wiki/Theorem.html" title="Theorem">theorems</a> about <a href="/wiki/Permutation.html" title="Permutation">permutations</a> — in his attack on Enigma. These mathematical techniques, combined with material supplied by <a href="/wiki/France.html" title="France">French</a> <a href="/wiki/Military_intelligence.html" title="Military intelligence">military intelligence</a>, enabled him to reconstruct the internal wirings of the machine's rotors and nonrotating reflector. "The solution", historian <a href="/wiki/David_Kahn.html" title="David Kahn">David Kahn</a> writes, "was Rejewski's own stunning achievement, one that elevates him to the pantheon of the greatest cryptanalysts of all time"<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a  title="">[5]</a></sup>. Rejewski used a mathematical theorem that one mathematics professor has since described as "the theorem that won World War II"<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a  title="">[6]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Rejewski studied the first six letters of all the Enigma messages intercepted on a single day. For security, each message sent on Enigma was encrypted using a different starting position of the three rotors, chosen by the operator. This was termed the <i>message setting</i>, and was three letters long. To convey this to the receiving operator, a sending operator began each message by sending the message setting in a disguised form — a six-letter <i>indicator</i>. The indicator was formed using the Enigma with the rotors set to a common global setting for that day, termed the <i>ground setting</i>, shared by all operators. Unfortunately for the Germans, the particular way the indicator was constructed introduced a fundamental weakness into the system.</p>
<p>For example, suppose the operator chose the message setting <tt>KYG</tt> for a message. The operator would first set the Enigma's rotors to the ground setting, which might be <tt>GBL</tt> on that particular day, and then encrypt the message setting on the Enigma <i>twice</i>; that is, the operator would enter <tt>KYGKYG</tt> (which might come out to something like <tt>QZKBLX</tt>). The operator would then reposition the rotors at <tt>KYG</tt>, and encrypt the actual message. A receiving operator could reverse the process to recover first the message setting, then the message itself. The repetition of the message setting was apparently meant as an error check to detect <a href="/wiki/Garble.html" title="Garble">garbles</a>, but it had the unforeseen effect of greatly weakening the cipher. Due to the indicator's repetition of the message setting, Rejewski knew that, in the <a href="/wiki/Plaintext.html" title="Plaintext">plaintext</a> of the indicator, the first and fourth letters were the same, the second and fifth were the same, and the third and sixth were the same. These relations could be exploited to break into the cipher.</p>
<p>Rejewski studied these related pairs of letters. For example, if there were four messages that had the following indicators on the same day: <tt>BJGTDN</tt>, <tt>LIFBAB</tt>, <tt>ETULZR</tt>, <tt>TFREII</tt>, then by looking at the first and fourth letters of each set, he knew that certain pairs of letters were related. <tt>B</tt> was related to <tt>T</tt>, <tt>L</tt> was related to <tt>B</tt>, <tt>E</tt> was related to <tt>L</tt>, and <tt>T</tt> was related to <tt>E</tt>: (<tt>B</tt>,<tt>T</tt>), (<tt>L</tt>,<tt>B</tt>), (<tt>E</tt>,<tt>L</tt>), and (<tt>T</tt>,<tt>E</tt>). If he had enough different messages to work with, he could build entire sequences of relationships: the letter <tt>B</tt> was related to <tt>T</tt>, which was related to <tt>E</tt>, which was related to <tt>L</tt>, which was related to <tt>B</tt> (see diagram). This was a "cycle of 4", since it took four jumps until it got back to the start letter. Another cycle on the same day might be <tt>A</tt><img class='tex' src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/math/8/3/e/83e37b7246fdfcb99b2754210ebeae27.png" alt="\rightarrow" /><tt>F</tt><img class='tex' src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/math/8/3/e/83e37b7246fdfcb99b2754210ebeae27.png" alt="\rightarrow" /><tt>W</tt><img class='tex' src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/math/8/3/e/83e37b7246fdfcb99b2754210ebeae27.png" alt="\rightarrow" /><tt>A</tt>, or a "cycle of 3". If there were enough messages on a given day, all the letters of the alphabet might be covered by a number of different cycles of various sizes. The cycles would be consistent for one day, and then would change to a different set of cycles the next day. Similar analysis could be done on the 2nd and 5th letters, and the 3rd and 6th, identifying the cycles in each case and the number of steps in each cycle.</p>
<p>Using the data thus gained, combined with Enigma operators' tendency to choose predictable letter combinations as indicators (such as girlfriends' initials or a pattern of keys that they saw on the Enigma keyboard), Rejewski was able to deduce six <a href="/wiki/Permutation.html" title="Permutation">permutations</a> corresponding to the encipherment at six consecutive positions of the Enigma machine. These permutations could be described by six <a href="/wiki/Equation.html" title="Equation">equations</a> with various unknowns, representing the wiring within the entry drum, rotors, reflector, and plugboard<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a  title="">[7]</a></sup>.</p>

<p><a name="Assistance_from_French_Intelligence" id="Assistance_from_French_Intelligence"></a></p>
<h3>Assistance from French Intelligence</h3>
<p>At this point Rejewski ran into difficulty: the large number of unknowns made the equations complex. He would later comment in 1980 that it was still not known whether such a set of six equations was solvable without further data. But he was assisted by cryptographic documents that a section of the French intelligence organization (the <a  class="new" title="Deuxième Bureau">Deuxième Bureau</a>), under future General <a href="/wiki/Gustave_Bertrand.html" title="Gustave Bertrand">Gustave Bertrand</a>, had obtained and passed on to the Polish Cipher Bureau. The documents had been procured from a <a href="/wiki/Traitor.html" title="Traitor">traitor</a> in the German cipher office, <a href="/wiki/Hans-Thilo_Schmidt.html" title="Hans-Thilo Schmidt">Hans-Thilo Schmidt</a>, and included the Enigma settings for the months of September and October 1932. On December 9 or 10<sup><a  title="">(Note 4)</a></sup>, 1932, the documents were given to Rejewski, who used their information to eliminate the effect of the plugboard from the equations. With the reduced number of unknowns, solving the equations became a tractable problem.</p>
<p>Another obstacle had to be overcome, however. The military Enigma had been modified from the commercial Enigma, of which Rejewski had had an actual example to study. In the commercial machine, the keys were connected to the entry drum in German keyboard order ("QWERTZU…"). However, in the military Enigma, the connections had instead been wired in alphabetical order: "ABCDEF…" This new wiring sequence foiled British codebreakers working on Enigma, who dismissed the "ABCDEF…" wiring as too obvious. Rejewski, perhaps guided by an intuition about a German fondness for order, simply guessed that the wiring was the normal alphabetic ordering. He later recalled that, after he had made this assumption, "from my pencil, as by magic, began to issue numbers designating the connections in rotor <i>N</i>. Thus the connections in one rotor, the right-hand rotor, were finally known"<sup id="_ref-Kozaczuk258_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[8]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The settings provided by French Intelligence covered two months which straddled a changeover period for the rotor ordering. A different rotor happened to be in the right-hand position for the second month, and so the wirings of two rotors could be recovered by the same method<sup><a  title="">(Note 5)</a></sup>. This simplified the analysis, and by the end of the year, the wirings of all three rotors and the reflector had been recovered. An example message in an Enigma instruction manual provided a sequence of <a href="/wiki/Plaintext.html" title="Plaintext">plaintext</a> and corresponding <a href="/wiki/Ciphertext.html" title="Ciphertext">ciphertext</a> enciphered at a given setting; this helped Rejewski eliminate remaining ambiguity from the wiring<sup id="_ref-Kozaczuk258_1" class="reference"><a  title="">[8]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>There has been speculation as to whether the rotor wirings could have been solved without the documents supplied by French Intelligence. Rejewski recalled in 1980 that another way had been found that could have been used to achieve this, but that the method was "imperfect and tedious" and relied on chance. In 2005, mathematician John Lawrence published a paper arguing that it would have taken four years for this method to have had a reasonable likelihood of success<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a  title="">[9]</a></sup>. Rejewski wrote that "the conclusion is that the intelligence material furnished to us should be regarded as having been decisive to solution of the machine"<sup id="_ref-Kozaczuk258_2" class="reference"><a  title="">[8]</a></sup>.</p>

<h2>Methods for solving the daily Enigma settings</h2>
<p>After Rejewski had determined the wiring in the remaining rotors, he was joined in early 1933 by Różycki and Zygalski in devising methods and equipment to break Enigma ciphers routinely<sup><a  title="">(Note 6)</a></sup>. Rejewski later recalled:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now we had the machine, but we didn't have the <a href="/wiki/Key_%28cryptography%29.html" title="Key (cryptography)">keys</a> and we couldn't very well require Bertrand to keep on supplying us with the keys every month ... The situation had reversed itself: before, we'd had the keys but we hadn't had the machine — we solved the machine; now we had the machine but we didn't have the keys. We had to work out methods to find the daily keys.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a  title="">[10]</a></sup></p>

</div>
</div>
<p>A number of methods and devices had to be invented in response to continual improvements in German operating procedure and to the Enigma machine itself. The earliest method for reconstructing daily keys was the "<a href="/wiki/Grill_%28cryptology%29.html" title="Grill (cryptology)">grill</a>", based on the fact that the plugboard's connections exchanged only six pairs of letters, leaving fourteen letters unchanged. Next was Różycki's "<a href="/wiki/Clock_%28cryptology%29.html" title="Clock (cryptology)">clock</a>" method, which sometimes made it possible to determine which rotor was at the right-hand side of the Enigma machine on a given day.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a  title="">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p>After <a href="/wiki/October_1.html" title="October 1">1 October</a> <a href="/wiki/1936.html" title="1936">1936</a>, German procedure changed, increasing the number of plugboard connections. As a result, the grill method became considerably less effective. However, a method using a <a href="/wiki/Card_catalog_%28cryptology%29.html" title="Card catalog (cryptology)">card catalog</a> had been devised around 1934 or 1935, and was independent of the number of plugboard connections. The catalog was constructed using Rejewski's "<a href="/wiki/Cyclometer.html" title="Cyclometer">cyclometer</a>", a special-purpose device for creating a catalog of permutations. Once the catalog was complete, the permutation could be looked up in the catalog, yielding the Enigma rotor settings for that day.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a  title="">[12]</a></sup></p>
<p>The cyclometer comprised two sets of Enigma rotors, and was used to determine the length and number of cycles of the permutations that could be generated by the Enigma machine. Even with the cyclometer, preparing the catalog was a long and difficult task. Each position of the Enigma machine (there were 17,576 positions) had to be examined for each possible sequence of rotors (there were 6 possible sequences); therefore, the catalog comprised 105,456 entries. The preparation of the catalog took over a year, but when it was ready about 1935, it made obtaining daily keys a matter of 12–20 minutes.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a  title="">[13]</a></sup> However, on November 1 or 2, 1937, the Germans replaced the <a href="/wiki/Reflector_%28cipher_machine%29.html" title="Reflector (cipher machine)">reflector</a> in their Enigma machines, which meant that the entire catalog had to be recalculated from scratch. Nonetheless, by January 1938 the Cipher Bureau's German section was reading a remarkable 75% of Enigma intercepts, and according to Rejewski, with only a minimal increase in personnel, this could easily have been increased to 90%.<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a  title="">[14]</a></sup></p>

<p>In 1937 Rejewski, along with the German section of the Cipher Bureau, transferred to a secret facility near <a href="/wiki/Pyry.html" title="Pyry">Pyry</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Kabaty_Woods.html" title="Kabaty Woods">Kabaty Woods</a> south of Warsaw. On <a href="/wiki/September_15.html" title="September 15">September 15</a>, <a href="/wiki/1938.html" title="1938">1938</a>, new rules for enciphering message keys (a new "indicator procedure") were put into effect by the Germans, making the techniques then in use obsolete.<sup><a  title="">(Note 7)</a></sup> The Polish cryptanalysts rapidly responded with new techniques. One was Rejewski's <i><span lang="pl" xml:lang="pl"><a href="/wiki/Bomba_%28cryptography%29.html" title="Bomba (cryptography)">bomba</a></span></i>, an electrically powered aggregate of six Enigmas, which enabled the daily keys to be solved in about two hours. Six bombas were built and ready for use by mid-November 1938.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a  title="">[15]</a></sup> The bomba exploited the fact that the plugboard connections did not affect all the letters; therefore, when another change to German operating procedure occurred on <a href="/wiki/January_1.html" title="January 1">1 January</a> <a href="/wiki/1939.html" title="1939">1939</a>, increasing the number of plugboard connections, the usefulness of the machines was greatly reduced. The British <a href="/wiki/Bombe.html" title="Bombe">bombe</a>, the main tool that would be used to break Enigma messages during World War II, would be named after, and likely inspired by, the Polish bomba, although the cryptanalytic methods embodied by the two machines were very different.<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a  title="">[16]</a></sup></p>
<p>A manual method was invented around the same time by Zygalski, that of "<a href="/wiki/Perforated_sheets.html" title="Perforated sheets">perforated sheets</a>" ("Zygalski sheets"), which was independent of the number of plugboard connections. However, application of both the bomba and Zygalski's sheets was complicated by yet another change to the Enigma machine on <a href="/wiki/December_15.html" title="December 15">15 December</a> <a href="/wiki/1938.html" title="1938">1938</a>. The Germans had supplied Enigma operators with an additional two rotors to supplement the original three, and this increased the complexity of decryption tenfold. Building ten times as many bombes was beyond the Biuro's ability—that many bombes would have cost fifteen times their entire annual equipment budget. The following month, things became even worse when the number of plugboard cables increased from six to ten. Instead of twelve letters being swapped before entering the rotor scrambler, there were now twenty swapped letters, reducing the effectiveness of the bomba and increasing the number of possible plugboard settings by more than a thousandfold.<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a  title="">[17]</a></sup></p>

<p>As it became clear that war was imminent and Polish resources were insufficient to keep pace with the evolution of Enigma encryption (ie due to the Poles' difficulty in producing in time the required 60 series of "<a href="/wiki/Zygalski_sheets.html" title="Zygalski sheets">Zygalski sheets</a>"), the Polish General Staff and government decided to let their Western allies in on the secret.

<p>The Poles' gift of Enigma decryption to their Western allies, a month before the outbreak of World War II, came not a moment too soon. Knowledge that the cipher was crackable was a morale boost to Allied cryptanalysts. The British were able to manufacture at least two complete sets of perforated sheets—they sent one to <a href="/wiki/PC_Bruno.html" title="PC Bruno">PC Bruno</a>, outside Paris, in mid-December 1939—and began reading Enigma within months of the outbreak of war.</p>
<p>Without the Polish assistance, British code-breakers would, at the very least, have been considerably delayed in reading Enigma. Author Hugh Sebag-Montefiore concludes that substantial breaks into German Army and Air Force Enigma ciphers by the British would have occurred only after November 1941 at the earliest, after an Enigma machine and key lists had been captured, and similarly Naval Enigma only after late 1942.<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a  title="">[19]</a></sup> Former <a href="/wiki/Bletchley_Park.html" title="Bletchley Park">Bletchley Park</a> cryptologist <a href="/wiki/Gordon_Welchman.html" title="Gordon Welchman">Gordon Welchman</a> goes further, writing that the Army and Air Force Enigma section, <a href="/wiki/Hut_6.html" title="Hut 6">Hut 6</a>, "would never have gotten off the ground if we had not learned from the Poles, in the nick of time, the details both of the German military ... Enigma machine, and of the operating procedures that were in use".<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a  title="">[20]</a></sup></p>
<p>Intelligence gained from solving high-level German ciphers—intelligence codenamed "<a href="/wiki/Ultra.html" title="Ultra">Ultra</a>" by the British and Americans—came chiefly from Enigma decrypts. While the exact contribution of Ultra intelligence to Allied victory is disputed, Kozaczuk and Straszak note that "it is widely believed that Ultra saved the world at least two years of war and possibly prevented <a href="/wiki/Hitler.html" title="Hitler">Hitler</a> from winning."<sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a  title="">[21]</a></sup> The English historian Sir <a href="/wiki/Harry_Hinsley.html" title="Harry Hinsley">Harry Hinsley</a>, who worked at Bletchley Park, similarly assessed it as having "shortened the war by not less than two years and probably by four years". <sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a  title="">[22]</a></sup> The availability of Ultra was due in large part to the early Polish work on Enigma.</p>

<p>During September 1940 they returned to work in secret in unoccupied southern (Vichy) France.

Vichy France itself was liable to be occupied by German troops, and Cadix's radio transmissions were increasingly at risk of detection by the <i>Funkabwehr</i>, a German unit tasked with locating enemy radio transmitters. Indeed, on <a href="/wiki/November_6.html" title="November 6">6 November</a> a <a href="/wiki/Pickup_truck.html" title="Pickup truck">pickup truck</a> equipped with a circular <a href="/wiki/Antenna_%28radio%29.html" title="Antenna (radio)">antenna</a> arrived at the gate of the chateau where the cryptologists were operating.

<h3>Escape from France</h3>
<p>The Poles were split into twos and threes. Rejewski and Zygalski were sent to <a href="/wiki/Nice.html" title="Nice">Nice</a> on <a href="/wiki/November_11.html" title="November 11">11 November</a>, which was in a zone occupied by the Italians.

<p>The plan was to smuggle themselves over the <a href="/wiki/Pyrenees.html" title="Pyrenees">Pyrenees</a> across into <a href="/wiki/Spain.html" title="Spain">Spain</a>. Accompanied by a local guide, Rejewski and Zygalski began their trek through the Pyrenees on <a href="/wiki/January_29.html" title="January 29">29 January</a> 1943. They avoided German and Vichy patrols, but near midnight and near the border, their guide pulled out a <a href="/wiki/Pistol.html" title="Pistol">pistol</a> and demanded they hand over the rest of their money. Despite being robbed, they succeeded in reaching the Spanish side of the border, only to be arrested by Spanish security police within hours. The Poles were sent first to a prison in <a  class="new" title="Séo de Urgel">Séo de Urgel</a> until <a href="/wiki/March_24.html" title="March 24">24 March</a>, then moved to a prison at <a href="/wiki/Lerida.html" title="Lerida">Lerida</a>.

<p>Enigma decryption, however, had become an exclusively British and American domain; the two mathematicians who, with their late colleague, had laid the foundations for Allied Enigma decryption were now excluded from the opportunity of making further contributions to their métier. British code-breaker <a  class="new" title="Alan Stripp">Alan Stripp</a> suggests that by that time, at Bletchley Park, "very few even knew about the Polish contribution" because of the strict secrecy and the observance of the "<a href="/wiki/Need-to-know.html" title="Need-to-know">need-to-know</a>" principle.

<p>On <a href="/wiki/November_21.html" title="November 21">November 21</a>, <a href="/wiki/1946.html" title="1946">1946</a>, Rejewski, having been discharged from the Polish Army in Britain, returned to Poland to be reunited with his wife, Irena Maria Rejewska (née Lewandowska, whom Rejewski had married on <a href="/wiki/June_20.html" title="June 20">20 June</a> <a href="/wiki/1934.html" title="1934">1934</a>) and their two children, Andrzej (born 1936) and Janina (born 1939, who would follow in her father's footsteps to become a mathematician). One option now open to Rejewski was to resume teaching mathematics at a university in <a href="/wiki/Pozna%C5%84.html" title="Poznań">Poznań</a> or <a href="/wiki/Szczecin.html" title="Szczecin">Szczecin</a>, as suggested by his old <a href="/wiki/Pozna%C5%84_University.html" title="Poznań University">Poznań University</a> professor, <a href="/wiki/Zdzis%C5%82aw_Krygowski.html" title="Zdzisław Krygowski">Zdzisław Krygowski</a>. Taking a university post, however, would have entailed yet another separation from his family and his elderly in-laws, with whom the Rejewskis were now living in <a href="/wiki/Bydgoszcz.html" title="Bydgoszcz">Bydgoszcz</a>. A grievous blow to Rejewski, too, soon after his return, was the death in summer 1947 of his 11-year-old son Andrzej from <a href="/wiki/Poliomyelitis.html" title="Poliomyelitis">poliomyelitis</a>. Instead, Rejewski took a position in <a href="/wiki/Bydgoszcz.html" title="Bydgoszcz">Bydgoszcz</a> as a supervisor in the sales section of a cable manufacturing plant, <a  class="new" title="Kabel Polski">Kabel Polski</a> (Polish Cable).</p>
<p>The Polish <a href="/wiki/S%C5%82u%C5%BCba_Bezpiecze%C5%84stwa.html" title="Służba Bezpieczeństwa">Security Service</a> repeatedly investigated him between 1949 and 1958 but never found out about his history of success with Enigma; in 1950 they demanded that he be fired from his employment<sup id="_ref-28" class="reference"><a  title="">[30]</a></sup>. Thereafter, he worked briefly at the State Surveying Company as a supervisor, then at the Union of Surveyors of Poland. Between 1951 and 1954 he was employed at the Branch Union of Timber and Varied Manufactures Cooperative. From 1954 until his retirement in February 1967, he worked as a bookkeeper at the Provincial Union of Labour Cooperatives.</p>
<p>Until this point, Rejewski had remained silent about his prewar and wartime work. Shortly after his retirement, he wrote a memoir of his work on Enigma and deposited it at the Military Historical Institute. In 1969 he moved back with his family to Warsaw<sup id="_ref-29" class="reference"><a  title="">[31]</a></sup>. When the role of the Poles in the Enigma story emerged in 1973, Rejewski published a number of papers on his cryptologic work and contributed generously to articles, books and television programs the world over on the subject. He maintained a lively correspondence with his wartime French host, General <a href="/wiki/Gustave_Bertrand.html" title="Gustave Bertrand">Gustave Bertrand</a>, author of the first book published on <i><a href="/wiki/Enigma_machine.html" title="Enigma machine">Enigma</a></i> (1973), which Rejewski at Bertrand's suggestion began translating into Polish. A few years before his death, Rejewski broke <a href="/wiki/Encipher.html" title="Encipher">enciphered</a> correspondence of <a href="/wiki/J%C3%B3zef_Pi%C5%82sudski.html" title="Józef Piłsudski">Józef Piłsudski</a> and his fellow <a href="/wiki/Polish_Socialist_Party.html" title="Polish Socialist Party">Polish Socialist</a> conspirators from 1904<sup id="_ref-30" class="reference"><a  title="">[32]</a></sup>. On <a href="/wiki/August_12.html" title="August 12">12 August</a> <a href="/wiki/1978.html" title="1978">1978</a>, he received the Officer's Cross of the Order of <a href="/wiki/Polonia_Restituta.html" title="Polonia Restituta">Polonia Restituta</a><sup id="_ref-31" class="reference"><a  title="">[33]</a></sup>.

<p>The story of Rejewski and his co-workers has been celebrated both in Poland and abroad. He was decorated with a number of Polish medals, both before and after World War II, and after the Enigma story had become public knowledge. In 2000, Rejewski and his colleagues Zygalski and Różycki were posthumously awarded the <a  class="new" title="Grand Cross of the Order of the Rebirth of Poland">Grand Cross of the Order of the Rebirth of Poland</a>. On <a href="/wiki/July_4.html" title="July 4">July 4</a>, <a href="/wiki/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>, Rejewski's daughter received the <a href="/wiki/War_Medal_1939%E2%80%931945.html" title="War Medal 1939–1945">War Medal 1939–1945</a> on his behalf, presented by the <a href="/wiki/British_Chief_of_the_Defence_Staff.html" title="British Chief of the Defence Staff">British Chief of the Defence Staff</a><sup id="_ref-32" class="reference"><a  title="">[34]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>In 1979 Rejewski and his colleagues became the heroes of <i><a  class="new" title="Sekret Enigmy">Sekret Enigmy</a></i> ("The Enigma Secret"), a Polish-produced movie <a href="/wiki/Thriller.html" title="Thriller">thriller</a> documenting, with a few embellishments, the Polish solution of Enigma. Shortly afterwards a Polish <a href="/wiki/Television_serial.html" title="Television serial">TV series</a> was produced with a similar theme, <i>Tajemnice Enigmy</i> ("The Secrets of Enigma"). In 1983, a Polish <a href="/wiki/Postage_stamp.html" title="Postage stamp">postage stamp</a> marked the 50th anniversary of the German military Enigma's first solution. Memorials to the trio have been unveiled at Bletchley Park and the Polish Embassy in the UK, and at <a href="/wiki/Uz%C3%A8s.html" title="Uzès">Uzès</a> in France. In Rejewski's home city of Bydgoszcz, a street and school have been named for him, a plaque placed on the building where he had lived, and a sculpture commissioned (pictured above, left). In 2005 a postcard (below, center) was issued on the 100th anniversary of Rejewski's birth.</p>

<li>An early Naval Enigma model (the "O Bar" machine) had been solved before 1931 by the Polish Cipher Bureau, but it did not have the plugboard of the later standard Enigma <sup id="_ref-34" class="reference"><a  title="">[36]</a></sup>. Mahon cites, as his source for "most of the information I have collected about prewar days", <a href="/wiki/Alan_Turing.html" title="Alan Turing">Alan Turing</a>, who had received it from the "Polish cryptographers", who Mahon says had done "nearly all the early work on German Naval Enigma [and] handed over the details of their very considerable achievements just before the outbreak of war."</li>
<li>Some writers, after Bloch (1987), argue that Rejewski is more likely to have received these documents in mid-November 1932, rather than 9/10 December.</li>
<li>Lawrence (2004) shows how Rejewski could have adapted his method to solve for the second rotor, even if the settings lists had not straddled the quarterly changeover period.</li>
<li>More Enigma settings were provided to the Polish Cipher Bureau by French Intelligence, but these were never passed on to Rejewski and his colleagues. A possible explanation for this is that the Poles wished to remain independent of French assistance for reading Enigma, and without outside help the cryptologists were forced to develop their own self-sufficient techniques.</li>
<li>The Navy had already changed its Enigma indicator procedure on <a href="/wiki/May_1.html" title="May 1">1 May</a> <a href="/wiki/1937.html" title="1937">1937</a>.
