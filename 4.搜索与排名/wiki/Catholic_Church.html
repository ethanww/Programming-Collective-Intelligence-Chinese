<h2>Terminology</h2>
<p>The Church described in this article uses many names to describe itself, the most common being simply "the Church".<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a  title="">[4]</a></sup> It has not declared any of these names to be <i>the</i> name by which it should be known. However, in view of the sensibilities of other Churches, it refers to itself in its relations with them as either "the Catholic Church"<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a  title="">[5]</a></sup> or "the Roman Catholic Church".<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a  title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>Divergent usages attach a certain ambiguity to each of the terms <i>Roman Catholic Church</i> and <i>Catholic Church</i>. Some, in spite of the usage of the <a href="/wiki/Holy_See.html" title="Holy See">Holy See</a>, apply the term <i>Roman Catholic Church</i> only to the <a href="/wiki/Latin_Rite.html" title="Latin Rite">Western or Latin</a> Church, including those parts that follow a liturgical rite other than the Roman, but excluding the <a href="/wiki/Eastern_Rite_Catholic_Churches.html" title="Eastern Rite Catholic Churches">Eastern-Rite</a> <a href="/wiki/Particular_Church.html" title="Particular Church">particular Churches</a> that are in <a href="/wiki/Full_communion.html" title="Full communion">full</a> <a href="/wiki/Communion_%28Christian%29.html" title="Communion (Christian)">communion</a> with the Pope, and are part of the same Church, taken as a whole. As for the term <i>Catholic Church</i>, <a href="/wiki/Oriental_Orthodoxy.html" title="Oriental Orthodoxy">Oriental Orthodox</a>, <a href="/wiki/Eastern_Orthodox_Church.html" title="Eastern Orthodox Church">Eastern Orthodox</a>, <a href="/wiki/Lutheran.html" title="Lutheran">Lutheran</a>, <a href="/wiki/Anglican.html" title="Anglican">Anglican</a>, <a href="/wiki/Old_Catholic_Church.html" title="Old Catholic Church">Old-Catholic</a>, and other Christians claim to be, or to be part of, the Catholic Church. For their understandings of the term, see <a href="/wiki/Catholicism.html" title="Catholicism">Catholicism</a>, <a href="/wiki/Catholic.html" title="Catholic">Catholic</a>, and <a href="/wiki/One%2C_Holy%2C_Catholic%2C_and_Apostolic_Church.html" title="One, Holy, Catholic, and Apostolic Church">One, Holy, Catholic, and Apostolic Church</a>.</p>
<p>The probably sixth-century <a href="/wiki/Decretum_Gelasianum.html" title="Decretum Gelasianum">Decretum Gelasianum</a> speaks of books by certain heretics and schismatics as rejected and banished from "omni Romana catholica et apostolica ecclesia",<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a  title="">[7]</a></sup> a phrase which probably means "the whole catholic and apostolic Church of Rome" (i.e. the see of Rome), but which, in a version<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a  title="">[8]</a></sup> that also mistranslates "repudiata .. eliminata" not as "(the books) <i>have been</i> rejected ... banished"<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a  title="">[9]</a></sup> but as "<i>is to be</i> rejected ... eliminated", has also been interpreted as meaning "the whole <i>Roman Catholic</i> and Apostolic Church."</p>
<p>While, apart from such doubtful cases, Protestants were the first to use the term <i>Roman Catholic</i> to distinguish the whole of the Church faithful to the Bishop of Rome from theirs, Catholics themselves employed it as early as the seventeenth century, both in English and in Latin ("Ecclesia catholica romana") and French ("Église catholique romaine"),<a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13121a.htm">[8]</a> to profess their faith in the importance of communion with the see of Rome. However, this is generally not the Church's preferred term, because of its use by some to posit a distinction between "the <i>Roman</i> Catholic Church" and another supposed larger body that <i>they</i> call "the Catholic Church". In its relations with other Christians, the Church therefore prefers to refer to itself as "the Catholic Church", rather than "the Roman Catholic Church", while in internal use the far most common term is simply "the Church", which appears many hundreds of times in the <i><a href="/wiki/Catechism_of_the_Catholic_Church.html" title="Catechism of the Catholic Church">Catechism of the Catholic Church</a></i>, against the 24 times that "the Catholic Church" appears, while "the Roman Catholic Church" does not appear at all.</p>
<p>Although most other Christian denominations prefer the term <i>Roman Catholic Church</i>, some of them formally accept the term <i>Catholic</i>, as shown, for instance, in the joint documents referred to above. In non-formal use, even members of groups that dispute the Church's right to this name commonly understand <i>Catholic</i> as referring to it. Indeed, as far back as 397, Saint <a href="/wiki/Augustine_of_Hippo.html" title="Augustine of Hippo">Augustine of Hippo</a> remarked that the term was commonly thus understood even by those whom he qualified as "<a href="/wiki/Heresy.html" title="Heresy">heretics</a>":</p>
<dl>
<dd>… the name itself of Catholic, which, not without reason, amid so many heresies, the Church has thus retained; so that, though all heretics wish to be called Catholics, yet when a stranger asks where the Catholic Church meets, no heretic will venture to point to his own chapel or house.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a  title="">[10]</a></sup></dd>
</dl>
<p>For reasons of simplicity and clarity, the simpler term, "Catholic Church", is freely used within this article without suggesting acceptance of any claims thought to be implicit in that term, while "Roman Catholic Church" is used without endorsing the view that the Church in question is merely part of some larger "Catholic Church". Both terms are treated within this article simply as alternative names for the entire Church "which is governed by the successor of Peter and by the bishops in communion with him" (<i><a href="/wiki/Lumen_gentium.html" title="Lumen gentium">Lumen gentium</a></i>, 8).<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a  title="">[11]</a></sup></p>

<p>Following the decline of the Roman Empire, the Church underwent a time of missionary activity and expansion. The success of monasticism gave rise to various centers of learning, most famously in Ireland and Gaul, and contributed to the <a href="/wiki/Carolingian_Renaissance.html" title="Carolingian Renaissance">Carolingian Renaissance</a>.

<p>Beginning around 1184, and continuing through the Reformation, a number of historical movements involving the Catholic Church, broadly referred to as the Inquisition, were aimed at securing religious and doctrinal unity within Christianity through conversion, and sometimes persecution, of alleged <a href="/wiki/Heretic.html" title="Heretic">heretics</a>.

<p>The Council of Trent and its reforms provided the theme for the next 300 years of Catholic history. The period lay an emphasis on catechesis and missionary work, in which the <a href="/wiki/Jesuit.html" title="Jesuit">Jesuit</a> and <a href="/wiki/Franciscan.html" title="Franciscan">Franciscan</a> orders were prominent. The 18th and 19th century Church found itself facing not only the teachings of Protestantism, but also <a href="/wiki/Age_of_Enlightenment.html" title="Age of Enlightenment">Enlightenment</a> and <a href="/wiki/Modernist.html" title="Modernist">Modernist</a> teachings about the nature of the human person, the state, and morality.

<p>The <a href="/wiki/First_Vatican_Council.html" title="First Vatican Council">First Vatican Council</a> (1869–1870) affirmed the doctrine of <a href="/wiki/Papal_infallibility.html" title="Papal infallibility">papal infallibility</a> which Catholics hold to be in continuity with the history of <a href="/wiki/Petrine_supremacy.html" title="Petrine supremacy">Petrine supremacy</a> in the Church, but <a href="/wiki/Eastern_Orthodox.html" title="Eastern Orthodox">Eastern Orthodox</a> and <a href="/wiki/Protestant.html" title="Protestant">Protestant</a> churches consider it a theological innovation.</p>

<p>The core beliefs of the Catholic Church are shared by the majority of other Trinitarian Christian groups. Its <a href="/wiki/Catechesis.html" title="Catechesis">catechesis</a> makes use of the <a href="/wiki/Nicene_Creed.html" title="Nicene Creed">Nicene Creed</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Apostles%27_Creed.html" title="Apostles' Creed">Apostles' Creed</a>, which are accepted also by most major Christian <a href="/wiki/Religious_denomination.html" title="Religious denomination">denominations</a>. The <i><a href="/wiki/Catechism_of_the_Catholic_Church.html" title="Catechism of the Catholic Church">Catechism of the Catholic Church</a></i> (964 pages in the Latin edition) gives a rather detailed account of its beliefs. The Compendium of the Catechism of the Catholic Church, first published in 2005 and in English in 2006, is a much more concise version of the Catechism, in question and answer form.</p>

<h3>Scripture and Tradition</h3>
<p>The principal sources for the teachings of the Catholic Church are the <a href="/wiki/Bible.html" title="Bible">Sacred Scriptures</a> and Sacred Tradition. The original language of most of the <a href="/wiki/Old_Testament.html" title="Old Testament">Old Testament</a> is <a href="/wiki/Hebrew_language.html" title="Hebrew language">Hebrew</a> or <a href="/wiki/Aramaic_language.html" title="Aramaic language">Aramaic</a>, but several books or portions of books were written in <a href="/wiki/Greek_language.html" title="Greek language">Greek</a>. The <a href="/wiki/New_Testament.html" title="New Testament">New Testament</a> was also written in Greek.</p>
<p>In his 1943 encyclical letter, <a href="/wiki/Divino_Afflante_Spiritu.html" title="Divino Afflante Spiritu">Divino Afflante Spiritu</a>, <a href="/wiki/Pope_Pius_XII.html" title="Pope Pius XII">Pope Pius XII</a> encouraged Biblical scholars to study diligently these original languages and other cognate languages, so as to arrive at a deeper and fuller knowledge of the meaning of the sacred texts, stating that "the original text ... having been written by the inspired author himself, has more authority and greater weight than any even the very best translation, whether ancient or modern" (<i><a  class="external text" title="http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xii/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xii_enc_30091943_divino-afflante-spiritu_en.html">Divino Afflante Spiritu, 16</a></i>).</p>
<p>There is a variety of sources for knowledge of Sacred Tradition, originally passed from the apostles in the form of oral tradition. Many of the writings of the Early Church Fathers reflect teachings of Sacred Tradition, such as <a href="/wiki/Apostolic_succession.html" title="Apostolic succession">apostolic succession</a>.</p>

<p><a name="Nature_of_God" id="Nature_of_God"></a></p>
<h3>Nature of God</h3>
<p>Catholicism is <a href="/wiki/Monotheism.html" title="Monotheism">monotheistic</a>: it acknowledges that God is one, eternal, all-powerful, all-knowing and omnipresent. God exists as distinct from and prior to his creation (that is, everything which is not God, and which depends directly on him for existence) and yet is still present intimately in His creation. In the <a href="/wiki/First_Vatican_Council.html" title="First Vatican Council">First Vatican Council</a> the Church has taught that, while by the natural light of human reason God can be known in his works as origin and end of all created things,<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a  title="">[18]</a></sup> God has also chosen to reveal himself and his will supernaturally in the ways indicated in the Letter to the Hebrews 1:1–2.</p>
<p>Catholicism is also <a href="/wiki/Trinitarianism.html" title="Trinitarianism">Trinitarian</a>: it believes that, while God is one in nature, essence, and being, this one God exists in three divine persons, each identical with the one essence, whose only distinctions are in their relations to one another: the Father's relationship to the Son, the Son's relationship to the Father, and the relations of both to the Holy Spirit, constitute the one God as a Trinity.</p>

</div>
<p>A Catholic is baptized in the name (singular) of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit — not three gods, but one God subsisting in three Persons. While sharing in the one divine essence, the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are distinct, not simply three "masks" or manifestations of one Person. The faith of the Church and of the individual Christian is based on a relationship with these three Persons of the one God.</p>
<p>The Catholic Church believes that God has revealed himself to humanity as Father to his only-begotten Son, who is in an eternal relationship with the Father: "No one knows the Son except the Father, just as no one knows the Father except the Son and those to whom the Son chooses to reveal Him."<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a  title="">[19]</a></sup></p>
<p>Catholics believe that God the Son, the <a href="/wiki/Divine_Logos.html" title="Divine Logos">Divine Logos</a>, the second of the three Persons of God, became <a href="/wiki/Incarnation.html" title="Incarnation">incarnate</a> as <a href="/wiki/Jesus_Christ.html" title="Jesus Christ">Jesus Christ</a>, a human being, born of the <a href="/wiki/Blessed_Virgin_Mary.html" title="Blessed Virgin Mary">Virgin Mary</a>. He remained truly divine and was at the same time truly human. In what he said, and by how he lived, he taught how to live, and revealed God as Love, the giver of unmerited favours or Graces.</p>
<p>After Jesus' <a href="/wiki/Crucifixion.html" title="Crucifixion">crucifixion</a> and <a href="/wiki/Resurrection.html" title="Resurrection">resurrection</a>, his followers, foremost among them the <a href="/wiki/Twelve_Apostles.html" title="Twelve Apostles">Apostles</a>, spread more and more extensively their faith in Jesus Christ with a vigour that they attributed to the presence of the Holy Spirit, the third of the three Persons of God, sent upon them by Jesus Christ.</p>

<h3>Humanity's separation from God</h3>
<p>Human beings, in Catholic belief, were originally created to live in union with God. Through the disobedience of the first humans, that relationship was broken and sin and death came into the world.<sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a  title="">[20]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/The_Fall_of_Man.html" title="The Fall of Man">The Fall</a> left humans in a state called <a href="/wiki/Original_sin.html" title="Original sin">original sin</a>, that is, separated from their original state of intimacy with God which carried into death through the idea of the individual human soul being immortal. But when Jesus came into the world, being both God and man, he was able through his sacrifice to reconcile humanity with God. By becoming one in Christ, through the Church, humanity was once again capable of intimacy with God but also offered a much more amazing gift: participation in the Divine Life on Earth, which will reach its fullness in heaven in the <a href="/wiki/Beatific_Vision.html" title="Beatific Vision">Beatific Vision</a>.</p>

<p>The Church is, as scripture states, "the body of Christ,"<sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a  title="">[21]</a></sup> and Catholics teach that it is one united body of believers both in heaven and on earth. There is therefore only one true, visible and physical Church, not several. And to this one Church, originally founded on Peter and the Apostles, Jesus gave a mandate to be the authoritative teacher and guardian of the faith. To transmit Christ's divine revelation, the apostles were given the mandate to "preach the Gospel," which they performed both orally and in writing, and which they preserved by leaving bishops as their successors. Thus, the <i>Catechism</i> states "the apostolic preaching, which is expressed in a special way in the inspired books, was to be preserved in a continuous line of succession until the end of time.

The Magisterium does, however, encourage its flock to read Sacred Scripture.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="/wiki/Catechism_of_the_Catholic_Church.html" title="Catechism of the Catholic Church">Catechism of the Catholic Church</a>, "the Church's first purpose is to be the sacrament of the inner union of men with God."

<h3>Salvation</h3>
<p>The Church teaches that salvation to eternal life is God's will for all people, and that God grants it to sinners as a free gift, a grace, through the sacrifice of Christ. Man cannot, in the strict sense, merit anything from God.<sup id="_ref-37" class="reference"><a  title="">[38]</a></sup> It is God who justifies, that is, who frees from sin by a free gift of holiness (sanctifying grace, also known as habitual or deifying grace). Man can accept the gift God gives through faith in Jesus Christ<sup id="_ref-38" class="reference"><a  title="">[39]</a></sup> and through baptism.<sup id="_ref-39" class="reference"><a  title="">[40]</a></sup> Man can also refuse the gift. Human cooperation is needed, in line with a new capacity to adhere to the divine will that God provides.<sup id="_ref-40" class="reference"><a  title="">[41]</a></sup> The faith of a Christian is not without works, otherwise it would be dead.<sup id="_ref-41" class="reference"><a  title="">[42]</a></sup> In this sense, "by works a man is justified, and not by faith alone,"<sup id="_ref-42" class="reference"><a  title="">[43]</a></sup> and eternal life is, at one and the same time, grace and the reward given by God for good works and merits.<sup id="_ref-43" class="reference"><a  title="">[44]</a></sup> Faith, and subsequently works, are a result of God's grace - thus, it is only because of grace that the believer can be said to "merit" salvation.</p>
<p>The Catholic Church teaches that through the graces Jesus won for humanity by sacrificing himself on the cross, salvation is possible even for those outside the visible boundaries of the Church. Christians and even non-Christians, if in life they respond positively to the grace and truth that God reveals to them through the mercy of Christ may be saved. This may sometimes include awareness of an obligation to become part of the Catholic Church. In such cases, "they could not be saved who, knowing that the Catholic Church was founded as necessary by God through Christ, would refuse either to enter it, or to remain in it."<sup id="_ref-44" class="reference"><a  title="">[45]</a></sup></p>

<p>Catholic teachings stress forgiveness, doing good to others, especially those most in need, and on the sanctity of life. Though Catholics were pacifists in the earliest days of the Church (witnessed by the fact that Christians were forbidden to join the Roman Army, part of the reason behind their political persecution in the empire, as explained in even high school history textbooks such as Carl Koch's "The Catholic Church"), only some Catholics hold that position today, with various analyses of "just war theory" more widely held. (However, it should be noted that the point of the Catholic just war criteria is to prevent and limit war rather than to justify it — as explained by Thomas Aquinas in the Summa Theologiae, Secunda Pars, Q. 40., and virtually every theologian who followed him). Also, though capital punishment has not itself been absolutely condemned by the Church, it has come under increasing criticism by theologians and Church leaders — Pope John Paul II, for instance, himself opposed capital punishment in all instances as being immoral because there are other options for punishment and deterrence in the modern world and he, along with most other modern Catholic theologians, held that if capital punishment were ever moral (a position some dispute), it would only be justifiable when there was no other option for the protection of the lives of others. In his encyclical "Evangelium Vitae" (The Gospel of Life) issued March 25, 1995 after four years of consultations with the world's Catholic bishops, John Paul II wrote that execution is only appropriate "in cases of absolute necessity, in other words, when it would not be possible otherwise to defend society. Today, however, as a result of steady improvement in the organization of the penal system, such cases are very rare, if not practically nonexistent." This position is also held by Avery Cardinal Dulles, Msgr. William Smith, Germain Grisez and the other major thinkers among Catholic moral theologians today.</p>

<p>The Catholic Church affirms the sanctity of all human life from conception to natural death. The Church believes that each person is made in the "image and likeness of God," and that human life should not be weighed against other values such as economy, convenience, personal preferences, or social engineering. Therefore, the Church opposes activities that they believe destroy or devalue divinely created life, including <a href="/wiki/Euthanasia.html" title="Euthanasia">euthanasia</a>, <a href="/wiki/Eugenics.html" title="Eugenics">eugenics</a> and <a href="/wiki/Abortion.html" title="Abortion">abortion</a>.</p>
<p>Many believe that the Church teaches that sex is sinful and an impairment to a grace-filled life.

<p>The Catholic Church is fundamentally liturgical in its public life of worship. Liturgy is derived from the Greek for "work of the people." The Second Vatican Council stated that "it is in the liturgy, especially in the divine sacrifice of the Eucharist, that 'the work of our redemption is accomplished,' and it is through the liturgy especially that the faithful are enabled to express in their lives and manifest to others the mystery of Christ and the real nature of the true Church."

<p>While the Catholic Church sees itself as the Church founded by Christ, it recognizes that many of the salvific elements of the Gospel are found in other Churches also. The <a href="/wiki/Second_Vatican_Council.html" title="Second Vatican Council">Second Vatican Council</a> document, <a href="/wiki/Lumen_Gentium.html" title="Lumen Gentium">Lumen Gentium</a>, 8, says that the sole Church of Christ as "<a href="/wiki/%22Subsistit_in%22_in_Lumen_Gentium.html" title="&quot;Subsistit in&quot; in Lumen Gentium">subsists in</a>", rather than simply "is" the Catholic Church, in view of its following statement: "Nevertheless, many elements of sanctification and truth are found outside its visible confines. Since these are gifts belonging to the Church of Christ, they are forces impelling towards Catholic unity."</p>

While relations with the <a href="/wiki/Eastern_Orthodox_Church.html" title="Eastern Orthodox Church">Eastern Orthodox Churches</a> were strained in the 1990s over property issues in countries that were formerly Soviet-dominated, these differences are not solved (<a href="/wiki/Lviv.html" title="Lviv">Lviv</a>-<a href="/wiki/Kiev.html" title="Kiev">Kiev</a>).

<p>What most obviously distinguishes the Catholic Church from other Christian bodies is the link between its members and the Pope. The <a href="/wiki/Catechism_of_the_Catholic_Church.html" title="Catechism of the Catholic Church">Catechism of the Catholic Church</a>, 882, quoting the Second Vatican Council’s document <i><a href="/wiki/Lumen_Gentium.html" title="Lumen Gentium">Lumen Gentium</a></i>, states: "The <i>Pope</i>, Bishop of Rome and Peter’s successor, ‘is the perpetual and visible source and foundation of the unity both of the bishops and of the whole company of the faithful.’"<sup id="_ref-54" class="reference"><a  title="">[55]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Pope is referred to as the Vicar of Christ and the Supreme Pontiff of the Universal Church. He may sometimes also use the less formal title of "Servant of the Servants of God". Applying to him the term "absolute" would, however, give a false impression: he is not free to issue decrees at whim. Instead, his charge forces on him awareness that he, even more than other bishops, is "tied", bound, by an obligation of strictest fidelity to the teaching transmitted down the centuries in increasingly developed form within the Catholic Church.</p>
<p>In certain limited and extraordinary circumstances, this papal primacy, which is referred to also as the Pope's Petrine authority or function, involves <a href="/wiki/Papal_infallibility.html" title="Papal infallibility">papal infallibility</a>, i.e. the <a href="/wiki/Dogmatic_definition.html" title="Dogmatic definition">definitive</a> character of the teaching on matters of faith and morals that he propounds solemnly as visible head of the Church.

<p>The cardinalate is not an integral part of the theological structure of the Catholic Church, but largely an honorific distinction that has its origins in the 1059 assignation of the right of electing the Pope exclusively to the principal clergy of Rome and the bishops of the seven "suburbicarian" sees. Because of their resulting importance, the term "cardinal" (from Latin "cardo", meaning "hinge") was applied to them. In the twelfth century the practice of appointing ecclesiastics from outside Rome as cardinals began. Each cardinal is still assigned a church in Rome as his "titular church" or is linked with one of the <a href="/wiki/Suburbicarian_diocese.html" title="Suburbicarian diocese">suburbicarian dioceses</a>.</p>

<p>Priests may perform many functions not directly connected with ordinary pastoral activity, such as study, research, teaching or office work.

All Rites of the Catholic Church maintain the ancient tradition that, after ordination, marriage is not allowed. Even a married priest whose wife dies may not then marry again.</p>

<p>Since the <a href="/wiki/Second_Vatican_Council.html" title="Second Vatican Council">Second Vatican Council</a>, the Latin Church again admits married men of mature age to ordination as Permanent deacons. "Deacons are ordained as a sacramental sign to the Church and to the world of Christ, who came 'to serve and not to be served.' The entire Church is called by Christ to serve, and the deacon, in virtue of his sacramental ordination and through his various ministries, is to be a servant in a servant-Church. As ministers of Word, deacons proclaim the Gospel, preach, and teach in the name of the Church. As ministers of Sacrament, deacons baptize, lead the faithful in prayer, witness marriages, and conduct wake and funeral services. As ministers of Charity, deacons are leaders in identifying the needs of others, then marshalling the Church's resources to meet those needs. Deacons are also dedicated to eliminating the injustices or inequities that cause such needs."<a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.usccb.org/deacon/faqs.shtml">[9]</a>.</p>
<p>Candidates for the Diaconate go through a Diaconate Formation program that is designed based on the contemporaneous needs of their Diocese but must meet minimum standards set by the Bishops Conference in their home country. Upon completion of their formation program and acceptance by their local Bishop, Candidates receive the Sacrament of Holy Orders through Ordination. Generally, following Ordination, a Deacon is assigned by his Bishop to a local Parish in which he will perform his ministry and serve the local church and community.</p>

<p>All baptized members of the Catholic Church are called <a href="/wiki/Faithful.html" title="Faithful">faithful</a>, truly equal in dignity and in the work to build the Church. All are called to share in Christ's priestly, prophetic, and royal office.<sup id="_ref-55" class="reference"><a  title="">[56]</a></sup> While a certain percentage of the faithful perform roles related to serving the ministerial priesthood (hierarchy) and giving eschatological witness (consecrated life), the great majority of the faithful perform a specific role of exercising the three offices of Christ by "engaging in temporal affairs and directing them according to God's will...to illuminate and order all temporal things."<sup id="_ref-56" class="reference"><a  title="">[57]</a></sup> These are the <a href="/wiki/Laity.html" title="Laity">laity</a>, whom John Paul II urged in <i>Christifideles laici</i> "to take an active, conscientious and responsible part in the mission of the Church," for they not only belong to the Church, but "<i>are the Church.</i>" (Italics in the original)</p>
<p>Equipped with the common priesthood in <a href="/wiki/Baptism.html" title="Baptism">baptism</a>, these ordinary Catholics — e.g., mothers, farmers, businessmen, writers, politicians — are to take initiative in "discovering or inventing the means for permeating social, political, and economic realities with the demands of Christian doctrine and life."<sup id="_ref-57" class="reference"><a  title="">[58]</a></sup> They exercise the common, baptism-based <i>priestly office</i> by offering their works as spiritual sacrifices,<sup id="_ref-58" class="reference"><a  title="">[59]</a></sup> the <i>prophetic office</i> by their word and testimony of life in the ordinary circumstances of the world,<sup id="_ref-59" class="reference"><a  title="">[60]</a></sup> and the <i>kingly office</i> by self-mastery and conforming worldly institutions to the norms of justice.<sup id="_ref-60" class="reference"><a  title="">[61]</a></sup></p>
<p>This theology of the laity, called a "characteristic mark" of Vatican II by Paul VI and John Paul II, was complemented, and in some cases influenced, by the rise of many lay ecclesial movements and structures in the 20th century: examples are <a href="/wiki/Focolare.html" title="Focolare">Focolare</a>, <a href="/wiki/Neocatechumenal_Way.html" title="Neocatechumenal Way">Neocatechumenal Way</a>, <a href="/wiki/Communion_and_Liberation.html" title="Communion and Liberation">Communion and Liberation</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/Personal_prelature_of_Opus_Dei.html" title="Personal prelature of Opus Dei">personal prelature of Opus Dei</a>.<br clear="all" /></p>

<p>Within the Catholic Church, the Consecrated Life refers to the following: the Religious Life, eremitical life, consecrated virginity, societies of consecrated life and secular institutes. All of these are ways of Christian living by those who have made the prescribed public profession and vow that is recognized in Church Law.<sup id="_ref-61" class="reference"><a  title="">[62]</a></sup> Those who have made their profession and vow are not, however, part of the Church hierarchy, unless they are also ordained priests.<sup id="_ref-62" class="reference"><a  title="">[63]</a></sup> They commit themselves, for the love of God, to observe as binding certain counsels from the Christian Gospel. Most who feel called to following Christ in a more exacting way join what are called <i>Religious Institutes</i>,<sup id="_ref-63" class="reference"><a  title="">[64]</a></sup> often referred to in everyday life as religious orders or religious congregations, in which they follow a common rule under the leadership of a superior.

<p>The number of Catholics in the world continues to increase, particularly in <a href="/wiki/Africa.html" title="Africa">Africa</a> and <a href="/wiki/Asia.html" title="Asia">Asia</a>, although the religion has lost much of its political influence in the "First World" (e.g. Europe, USA).

In most industrialized countries, church attendance has decreased since the 19th century, though it remains higher than that of other "mainline" Churches.</p>
<p>According to <a href="/wiki/Canon_law_%28Catholic_Church%29.html" title="Canon law (Catholic Church)">Canon law</a>, members are those who have been baptized in or, on making a profession of faith, have been received into the Catholic Church. They remain members, even if unfaithful to their obligations or even if excommunicated, unless they formally renounce membership by, for instance, joining another religion or denomination. However, in countries where a question on religion is included in the census, the number given in the <i>Statistical Yearbook of the Church</i> (see above) is that of the census returns; thus, for instance, in the case of New Zealand, where 27.5% of the population classified themselves in the 2001 census as being of no religion, the number of canonical Catholics is doubtless higher than the number appearing in the <i>Statistical Yearbook of the Church</i>. Furthermore, since Catholic population is the usual basis for assessing each diocese's contribution to national-level offices and services and the levy on each parish for diocesan initiatives, there is a temptation, not always resisted, for bishops and parish clergy in countries that do not have detailed census reports on religion to under-report the number of Catholics in their area.</p>

<p>Over the centuries, the Catholic Church has encountered criticisms for numerous reasons. (Some particular controversies are discussed in separate articles. See, for instance, on the charge of anti-Semitism, <a href="/wiki/Relations_between_Catholicism_and_Judaism.html" title="Relations between Catholicism and Judaism">Relations between Catholicism and Judaism</a>.) <a href="/wiki/Pope_John_Paul_II.html" title="Pope John Paul II">Pope John Paul II</a> acknowledged publicly that certain members (including leadership) of the Catholic Church have sometimes been involved in questionable activities, and asked God to forgive the sins of its members, both in action and omission. <i>See also: <a href="/wiki/Criticism_of_the_Catholic_Church.html" title="Criticism of the Catholic Church">Criticism of the Catholic Church</a></i>.</p>
<p>And at the same time, it has been seen by many people of different religions as a great force for good, as an "expert in humanity" and even as a model of management being seen by them as the oldest and biggest existing institution in the world. <a href="/wiki/John_Paul_II.html" title="John Paul II">John Paul II</a> was hailed upon his death as an outstanding world leader esteemed as having helped the world progress towards moral regeneration.</p>
<p>The number of criticisms and persecutions it has received through the centuries and his reading of sacred scripture inspired John Paul II to suggest that the term <i><a href="/wiki/Sign_of_contradiction.html" title="Sign of contradiction">sign of contradiction</a></i> is a "distinctive definition of Christ and of his Church."</p>

<p>Many <a href="/wiki/The_Age_of_Enlightenment.html" title="The Age of Enlightenment">enlightenment philosophers</a> perceived the Church's doctrines as superstitious and hindering the progress of civilization. In the most famous instance, many criticized it for the 1633 trial of <a href="/wiki/Galileo_Galilei.html" title="Galileo Galilei">Galileo Galilei</a>, in which the Church condemned his advancement of the heliocentric system of Catholic priest <a href="/wiki/Nicolaus_Copernicus.html" title="Nicolaus Copernicus">Nicolaus Copernicus</a>, in favour of a geocentric system. <a href="/wiki/Pope_John_Paul_II.html" title="Pope John Paul II">Pope John Paul II</a> publicly apologized for the Church's actions in that trial on <a href="/wiki/October_31.html" title="October 31">31 October</a> <a href="/wiki/1992.html" title="1992">1992</a>.

Historian of hospitals, Guenter Risse, says that the Church spearheaded the development of a hospital system geared towards the marginalized.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>While it is criticized in many places, the Catholic Church also has contributed much to society through its Social Doctrine which has guided leaders to promote social justice and by setting up the <a href="/wiki/Hospital.html" title="Hospital">hospital</a> system in Medieval Europe, a system which was different from the merely reciprocal hospitality of the Greeks and family-based obligations of the Romans. These hospitals were established to cater to "particular social groups marginalized by poverty, sickness, and age," according to historian of hospitals, <a  class="new" title="Guenter Risse">Guenter Risse</a>.<sup id="_ref-73" class="reference"><a  title="">[74]</a></sup></p>
<p>"During the thirteenth century" writes <a href="/wiki/James_Joseph_Walsh.html" title="James Joseph Walsh">J.J.Walsh</a>, "an immense number of [these] hospitals were built. The Italian cities were the leaders of the movement. Milan had no less than a dozen hospitals and Florence before the end of the Fourteenth century had some thirty hospitals. Some of these were very beautiful buildings. At Milan a portion of the general hospital was designed by <a href="/wiki/Donato_Bramante.html" title="Donato Bramante">Bramante</a> and another part of it by <a href="/wiki/Michelangelo.html" title="Michelangelo">Michelangelo</a>. The <i>Hospital of the innocents</i><sup id="_ref-74" class="reference"><a  title="">[75]</a></sup> in Florence for foundlings was an architectural gem. The Hospital of Sienna, built in honor of <a href="/wiki/Catherine_of_Siena.html" title="Catherine of Siena">St. Catherine</a>, has been famous ever since. Everywhere throughout Europe this hospital movement spread. <a href="/wiki/Rudolf_Virchow.html" title="Rudolf Virchow">Virchow</a>, the great German pathologist, in an article on hospitals, showed that every city of Germany of five thousand inhabitants had its hospital. He traced all of this hospital movement to <a href="/wiki/Pope_Innocent_III.html" title="Pope Innocent III">Pope Innocent III</a>, and though he was least papistically inclined, Virchow did not hesitate to give extremely high praise to this pontiff for all that he had accomplished for the benefit of children and suffering mankind."<sup id="_ref-75" class="reference"><a  title="">[76]</a></sup></p>
<p>The beauty and efficiency of the Italian hospitals inspired even some who were otherwise critical of the Church. The German historian <a href="/wiki/Ludwig_von_Pastor.html" title="Ludwig von Pastor">Ludwig von Pastor</a> recounts the words of <a href="/wiki/Martin_Luther.html" title="Martin Luther">Martin Luther</a> who, while journeying to Rome in the winter of 1510-1511, had occasion to visit some of these hospitals:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In Italy, he remarks, the hospitals are handsomely built, and admirably provided with excellent food and drink, careful attendants and learned physicians. The beds and bedding are clean, and the walls are covered with paintings. When a patient is brought in, his clothes are removed in the presence of a notary who makes a faithful inventory of them, and they are kept safely. A white smock is put on him and he is laid on a comfortable bed, with clean linen. Presently two doctors come to him, and the servants bring him food and drink in clean glasses, showing him all possible attention.<sup id="_ref-76" class="reference"><a  title="">[77]</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Catholic Church as opus proprium, says Benedict XVI in Deus Caritas Est, has conducted throughout the centuries from its very beginning and continues to conduct many charitable services — hospitals, schools, poverty alleviation programs, among others. The Catholic Church remains the largest humanitarian organization in the world and is a leading voice for the poor.</p>

<p><a name="Clerical_celibacy" id="Clerical_celibacy"></a></p>
<h3>Clerical celibacy</h3>
<p>The Catholic Church requires <a href="/wiki/Celibacy.html" title="Celibacy">celibacy</a> for Latin-Rite priests (with some minor exceptions) and all bishops. Voluntary celibacy has always been common in the Church and was generally the preferred state for priests and bishops. It is claimed that celibacy became mandatory for priests only in the eleventh century; others say, for instance: "(I)t may fairly be said that by the time of <a href="/wiki/Pope_Leo_I.html" title="Pope Leo I">St. Leo the Great</a> the law of celibacy was generally recognized in the West,"<a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03481a.htm">[10]</a> that the eleventh-century regulations on this matter, as on simony, should clearly not be interpreted as meaning that either non-celibacy or simony were previously permitted, <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/g7-reform1.html">[11]</a>, and that the rule of total continence by the clergy (refraining from sexual relations with a wife married before ordination - thus, logically, not marrying after ordination) dates back to the origin of the Church.<a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cclergy/documents/rc_con_cclergy_doc_01011993_bfoun_en.html">[12]</a> <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.christendom-awake.org/pages/mcgovern/celhist1.html">[13]</a></p>
<p>Pope John Paul II in <a  class="external text" title="http://www.ewtn.com/library/papaldoc/jp2shep.htm"><i>Pastores Dabo Vobis</i></a> stated that the "unchanging" essence of ordination "configures the priest to Jesus Christ the Head and Spouse of the Church." Thus, he said, "The Church, as the Spouse of Jesus Christ, wishes to be loved by the priest in the total and exclusive manner in which Jesus Christ her Head and Spouse loved her."</p>
<p>This teaching continues to be debated for a variety of reasons. First, many believe celibacy was not required of the apostles, though others think the apostles did leave their wives (cf. Luke 18:28-30). Second, this requirement excludes a great number of otherwise qualified men from the priesthood, qualifications which according to the defenders of celibacy should be determined not by merely human hermeneutics but by the hermeneutics of the divine will. Third, some say that resisting the natural sexual impulse in this way is unrealistic and harmful for a healthy life, a criticism which is countered by the faith in the power of grace and of man, made in the image of God who is Love. Sexual scandals among priests, the defenders say, are a breach of the Church's teaching, not a result of it, especially since only a small percentage of priests have been involved. Fourth, it is said that mandatory celibacy distances priests from this experience of life, compromising their moral authority in the pastoral sphere, although its defenders argue that the Church's moral authority is rather enhanced by a life of total self-giving in imitation of Christ, a practical application of Vatican II teaching that "man cannot fully find himself except through a sincere gift of himself." (<a  class="external text" title="http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_cons_19651207_gaudium-et-spes_en.html"><i>Gaudium et spes</i> 26</a>)</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Joseph_Cardinal_Ratzinger.html" title="Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger">Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger</a> in <i>Salt of the Earth</i> also explained that this practice is based on Jesus' preaching on the <a href="/wiki/Eunuchs.html" title="Eunuchs">eunuchs</a> or celibates "for the sake of the kingdom of heaven" which links with God's decision in the Old Testament to confer the priesthood to a specific tribe, that of Levi, and who unlike the other tribes did not receive from God any land — an essential need for one's posterity as a wife and children are today — but had "God himself as its inheritance." (Num 1:48-53)</p>

<p>The Catholic Church undertook one of the most comprehensive reforms in its history during the <a href="/wiki/Second_Vatican_Council.html" title="Second Vatican Council">Second Vatican Council</a> (1962–1965) and the decade which followed. For changes in the liturgy, see <a href="/wiki/Mass_of_Paul_VI.html" title="Mass of Paul VI">Mass of Paul VI</a>. The Church stressed more than before what it saw as positive rather than what it saw as negative in other Christian communities, other religions, and the aspirations of human beings in general. It encouraged the up-to-date renewal of religious life. And it empowered episcopal conferences to enact adaptations in disciplines such as abstinence from meat on Fridays.</p>
<p>Some Catholics, who have become known as <a href="/wiki/Traditionalist_Catholic.html" title="Traditionalist Catholic">traditionalist Catholics</a>, rejected many of these changes, which they viewed as inconsistent with what the Church had always taught. Among the most controversial of changes was the adoption of a new rite of Mass, which traditionalist Catholics view as watered down, "protestantized", or even invalid.</p>

<p>In 2002, a major scandal erupted in the U.S. Catholic Church when a wealth of allegations of priests sexually abusing children surfaced. Adding to the furor were revelations that the Church was aware of some of the abusive priests, and simply shuffled them from congregation to congregation instead of taking action. The scandal led to the resignation of Cardinal Bernard Law from the Boston archdiocese. It also led to a common perception — 64% of those polled, in one survey — that Catholic priests "frequently abused children," while the data show that only 1.5-1.8% of Catholic priests are accused of child sexual abuse. <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.catholicleague.org/research/abuse_in_social_context.htm">[14]</a></p>
<p>The <a  class="external text" title="http://www.americancatholic.org/news/clergysexabuse/johnjaycns.asp">The Catholic News Service</a> reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>About 4 percent of U.S. priests ministering from 1950 to 2002 were accused of sex abuse with a minor, according to the first comprehensive national study of the issue. The study said that 4,392 clergymen—almost all priests—were accused of abusing 10,667 people, with 75 percent of the incidents taking place between 1960 and 1984. During the same time frame there were 109,694 priests, it said. Sex-abuse related costs totaled $573 million, with $219 million covered by insurance companies, said the study done by the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The study listed the main characteristics of the sex abuse incidents reported. These included: -- An overwhelming majority of the victims, 81 percent, were males. The most vulnerable were boys aged 11 to 14, representing more than 40 percent of the victims. This goes against the trend in the general U.S. society where the main problem is men abusing girls.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Ireland, a number of high-profile cases of sexual abuse of children by Catholic priests and brothers have contributed to a significant decline in influence of the Church in recent years.</p>
<p>Since 2001, the adjudication of charges of sexual abuse by clergy is no longer within the competence of the local bishop, but is reserved to the <a href="/wiki/Congregation_for_the_Doctrine_of_the_Faith.html" title="Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith">Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith</a> in Rome, in accord with Pope John Paul II's Apostolic Letter <a  class="external text" title="http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/motu_proprio/documents/hf_jp-ii_motu-proprio_20020110_sacramentorum-sanctitatis-tutela_lt.html"><i>Sacramentorum sanctitatis tutela</i></a> and its <a  class="external text" title="http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_20010518_epistula_graviora%20delicta_lt.html">accompanying norms</a> (both documents in Latin).
