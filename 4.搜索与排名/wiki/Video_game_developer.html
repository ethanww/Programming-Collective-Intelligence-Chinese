<h2>Types of developers</h2>
<p>Video game developers fall into one of three main categories: <b>third-party developers</b>, <b>in-house developers</b>, and the smaller <b>independents</b>. Developers usually employ a staff of <a href="/wiki/Game_programmer.html" title="Game programmer">programmers</a>, <a href="/wiki/Game_designer.html" title="Game designer">game designers</a>, <a href="/wiki/Game_artist.html" title="Game artist">artists</a>, sound engineers, <a href="/wiki/Game_producer.html" title="Game producer">producers</a> and <a href="/wiki/Game_tester.html" title="Game tester">testers</a>, though some of these roles may be <a href="/wiki/Outsourcing.html" title="Outsourcing">outsourced</a>. Confusingly, an individual person in any one of these roles may be referred to as a "video game developer".</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Third-party developers">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Third-party_developers" id="Third-party_developers"></a></p>
<h3>Third-party developers</h3>

</div>
</div>
<p><b>Third-party developers</b> are usually called upon by a <a href="/wiki/Video_game_publisher.html" title="Video game publisher">video game publisher</a> to develop a title for one or more <a href="/wiki/Video_game_console.html" title="Video game console">systems</a>. Both the publisher and the developer have a great deal of say as to the <a href="/wiki/Game_design.html" title="Game design">design</a> and <a  class="new" title="Video game content">content</a> of the game. In general, though, the publisher's wishes trump the developer's, as the publisher is paying the developer to create the game.</p>
<p>The business arrangement between the developer and publisher is governed by a <a href="/wiki/Contract.html" title="Contract">contract</a>, which specifies a list of <a href="/wiki/Milestone.html" title="Milestone">milestones</a>, intended to be delivered every four to eight weeks. By receiving updated milestones, the publisher is able to verify that work is progressing quickly enough to meet the publisher's deadline; and to give direction to the developer if the game is turning out other than as expected in some way. When each milestone is completed and accepted, the publisher pays the developer an advance on <a href="/wiki/Royalties.html" title="Royalties">royalties</a>. The developer uses this money to fund its <a href="/wiki/Payroll.html" title="Payroll">payroll</a> and otherwise fund its operations.</p>
<p>Successful developers may maintain several teams working on different games for different publishers. In general, however, third-party developers tend to be small, and comprised of a single, closely-knit team.</p>
<p>Third-party game development is a volatile business, as small developers may be entirely dependent on money from one publisher. A single cancelled game can be lethal to a small developer. Because of this, many of the smaller development companies last only a few years or sometimes only a few months. The continual struggle to get payment for milestones and to line up the next game contract is a persistent distraction to the management of every game developer.</p>
<p>A common and desirable "exit strategy" for an extremely successful video game developer is to sell the company to a publisher, and thus become an in-house developer.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: In-house developers">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="In-house_developers" id="In-house_developers"></a></p>
<h3>In-house developers</h3>
<p>Many video game publishers maintain <b>in-house developers</b>, or <b>studios</b>. The size of the teams vary depending on the games, but they can number from a few people to the dozens. In the case of <a href="/wiki/MMORPG.html" title="MMORPG">MMORPGs</a> and the largest video games, the team size may number over 100.</p>
<p>In-house development teams tend to have more freedom as to the design and content of a game, compared to the teams third-party developers. Part of the reason for this is that since the developers are employees of the publisher, their interests are as exactly aligned with those of the publisher as is possible. The publisher can therefore spend much less effort making sure that the developer's decisions do not enrich the developer at the ultimate expense of the publisher.</p>
<p>In recent years the larger publishers have acquired several third-party developers. While these development teams are now technically "in-house" they often continue to operate in an autonomous manner, each with its own culture and work practices. For example: <a href="/wiki/Activision.html" title="Activision">Activision</a> acquired <a href="/wiki/Raven_Software.html" title="Raven Software">Raven</a> (1997), <a href="/wiki/Neversoft.html" title="Neversoft">Neversoft</a> (1999), <a href="/wiki/Z-Axis_Ltd..html" title="Z-Axis Ltd.">Z-Axis</a> (2001), <a href="/wiki/Treyarch.html" title="Treyarch">Treyarch</a> (2001), <a href="/wiki/Luxoflux.html" title="Luxoflux">Luxoflux</a> (2002), <a href="/wiki/Shaba_Games.html" title="Shaba Games">Shaba</a> (2002), <a href="/wiki/Infinity_Ward.html" title="Infinity Ward">Infinity Ward</a> (2003) and <a href="/wiki/Vicarious_Visions.html" title="Vicarious Visions">Vicarious Visions</a> (2005). All these developers continue to operate much as they did before acquisition, with the primary differences being in exclusivity and the financial details.</p>
<p>History has shown that publishers tend to be more forgiving of their own development teams going over budget and missing deadlines than third-party developers.</p>
<p>An in-house development team that works for a console hardware manufacturer is also known as a <a href="/wiki/First-party_developer.html" title="First-party developer">first-party developer</a>. A company that is closely tied to a console manufacturer (or occasionally a publisher) is known as a <a href="/wiki/Second-party_developer.html" title="Second-party developer">second-party developer</a>. Rather confusingly the publishers themselves are sometimes referred to as <a href="/wiki/Third-party_developer.html" title="Third-party developer">third-party developers</a> in the context of their relationships with the console manufacturers (Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo). This particular distinction of first, second and third party developers does not generally apply to PC games development.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Independent developers">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Independent_developers" id="Independent_developers"></a></p>
<h3>Independent developers</h3>
<p><b>Independents</b> are small software developers that are not owned by or beholden to a single publisher.</p>
<p>Some of these developers self-publish their games, relying on the <a href="/wiki/Internet.html" title="Internet">Internet</a> and word of mouth for publicity. Without the huge marketing budgets of mainstream publishers, their products never get as much recognition or popular acclaim as those of larger publishers. However, they are free to explore experimental themes and styles of gameplay that mainstream publishers would not risk their money on.</p>
<p>Other independent developers create game software for a number of <a href="/wiki/Video_game_publishers.html" title="Video game publishers">video game publishers</a> on various gaming platforms. In recent years this model has been in decline, with the larger publishers such as <a href="/wiki/Electronic_Arts.html" title="Electronic Arts">Electronic Arts</a> and <a href="/wiki/Activision.html" title="Activision">Activision</a> increasingly turning to internal studios -- usually former independent developers that they have acquired -- for the majority of their development needs.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Quality of life">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Quality_of_life" id="Quality_of_life"></a></p>
<h2>Quality of life</h2>
<p>Video game development in the <a href="/wiki/United_States.html" title="United States">United States</a> is performed in an extremely casual business environment. T-shirts and sandals are common work attire, and work hours are usually flexible; many developers start the work day at 10:00 AM, though employees usually work at least a full 40 hours a week. Employees are paid fairly well for what seems to <i>outsiders</i> to be light work. Many developers have some sort of <a href="/wiki/Profit-sharing.html" title="Profit-sharing">profit-sharing</a> plan to reward their employees.</p>
<p>Many find this type of environment rewarding and pleasurable, both professionally and personally. However, the industry is also known to require generally high working hours of its employees, sometimes at a level which is seen as unsustainable and destructive. <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://ea-spouse.livejournal.com/274.html">[1]</a></p>
<p>It should be noted that in addition to being within the <a href="/wiki/Software.html" title="Software">software</a> industry, game development is also within the <a href="/wiki/Entertainment.html" title="Entertainment">entertainment</a> industry, and most sectors of the entertainment industry (such as <a href="/wiki/Movie.html" title="Movie">movies</a> and <a href="/wiki/Television.html" title="Television">television</a>) are generally known for requiring long working hours and dedication from their employees. The creative rewards of entertainment industries in general attract more potential <a href="/wiki/Workforce.html" title="Workforce">labor</a> to the industry than some others, creating a competitive <a href="/wiki/Labor_market.html" title="Labor market">labor market</a> within the industry and thus requiring a higher level of performance from those who wish to remain competitive as employees. However, even given this, many feel that current working conditions in the industry are causing significant deterioration of the quality of life of its employees, and within industry communities (such as the <a href="/wiki/IGDA.html" title="IGDA">IGDA</a>) there is an increasing amount of discussion about the problem. Factors such as 'crunch time', described below, tend to heighten the overload.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Crunch time">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Crunch_time" id="Crunch_time"></a></p>
<h3>Crunch time</h3>
<p>Most video game developers are notorious for overworking their employees. "Crunch time" is the point at which management realizes that the team is experiencing "slippage": it is not going to achieve everything needed in order to complete the milestone on time, meaning the publisher will not pay the developer until the milestone is indeed completed; and since most development companies are such small operations, this presents a real risk that the company won't be able to pay its employees on time. Worse threats occur when it becomes apparent that the team won't be able to ship the game, as a whole, on time.</p>
<p>An extremely common management response to this is to invoke "crunch time", dictating a 60- to 80-hour work week with work over the weekends, in the hope that the team will be able to catch up. The complexity of the workflow in video game creation makes it very difficult to manage the team's schedules, meaning that it is an unusual project that does not surprise its managers with slippage at some point.</p>
<p>Controversially, employees in the United States are not paid <a href="/wiki/Overtime.html" title="Overtime">overtime</a> pay when crunching, as all developers maintain salaried employees. Salaried employees are classified as exempt, who are not paid by the hour, and are classified as "professionals". Therefore, most state laws on overtime pay do not apply. A notable exception is <a href="/wiki/California.html" title="California">California</a> where software developers are specifically protected by enforcing a minimum hourly wage (for every hour worked) to be considered exempt. As of 2006, this minimum salary works out to about <a href="/wiki/United_States_dollar.html" title="United States dollar">USD</a>$99K/yr, assumming a 40 hr week.</p>
<p>Attention to crunching came to something of a head in <a href="/wiki/2004_in_video_gaming.html" title="2004 in video gaming">2004</a> when a <a href="/wiki/Blog.html" title="Blog">blog</a> entry titled "ea_spouse", a manifesto of sorts, was published. Railing against the cruelty of crunch time, it was posted by <a  class="new" title="Erin Hoffman">Erin Hoffman</a>, the then-<a href="/wiki/Fiancee.html" title="Fiancee">fiancee</a> of <a href="/wiki/Electronic_Arts.html" title="Electronic Arts">Electronic Arts</a> developer <a  class="new" title="Leander Hasty">Leander Hasty</a> (Hasty and Hoffman have since wed, and have joined an independent development firm, <a  class="new" title="1st Playable Productions">1st Playable Productions</a> <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.1stplayable.com/">[2]</a>, as well as founding a website oriented towards the discussion of the game development environment industrywide, <a  class="new" title="Gamewatch">Gamewatch</a> <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.gamewatch.org">[3]</a>.) Hoffman said her life was being indirectly destroyed by the company's work policy. This led to a great deal of debate in the industry, but without any visible changes until March <a href="/wiki/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>, when Electronic Arts internally announced that it was planning to extend overtime pay to some of its employees not currently eligible.</p>
<p>The underlying problem of poor scheduling remains. Game developers, especially newer ones, have a reputation for allowing excess enthusiasm for a project to override good sense, with reality as to the immense amount of work that has been taken on setting in after the commercial schedule has already been decided. Effective and realistic project planning - and especially good <i>milestoning</i>, the process of breaking down a project into specific and manageable goals and predicting a realistic timeline for each one - by development companies can help prevent the worst of crunch-time situations.</p>
