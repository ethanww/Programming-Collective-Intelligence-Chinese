<p>In <a href="/wiki/Scientology.html" title="Scientology">Scientology</a> doctrine, <b>space opera</b> was the term used by Scientology founder <a href="/wiki/L._Ron_Hubbard.html" title="L.

The following descriptions of space opera incidents are seen as nonfiction in the <a href="/wiki/Scientology_beliefs_and_practices.html" title="Scientology beliefs and practices">beliefs of Scientology</a> <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.scientology.org/gloss.htm#SPACEOPERA">[1]</a> and has led to Scientology being characterized by some critics and commentators as a <a href="/wiki/UFO_religion.html" title="UFO religion">UFO religion</a> (Partridge, <i>UFO Religions</i>). Hubbard claimed that the modern-day <a href="/wiki/Science_fiction.html" title="Science fiction">science fiction</a> genre of <a href="/wiki/Space_opera.html" title="Space opera">space opera</a> is merely an <a href="/wiki/Unconscious_mind.html" title="Unconscious mind">unconscious</a> <a href="/wiki/Recollection.html" title="Recollection">recollection</a> of real events from millions of years ago.

<p>Scientology's doctrines famously include the story of <a href="/wiki/Xenu.html" title="Xenu">Xenu</a>, the ruler of the <a  title="">Galactic Confederacy</a> who brought billions of frozen people to Earth 75 million years ago, stacked them around <a href="/wiki/Volcano.html" title="Volcano">volcanoes</a> and blew them up with <a href="/wiki/Hydrogen_bomb.html" title="Hydrogen bomb">hydrogen bombs</a>, creating swarms of disembodied alien souls known as <a href="/wiki/Body_Thetan.html" title="Body Thetan">Body Thetans</a>. Xenu is only one element of Scientology beliefs in alien civilizations. Such doctrines have existed in Scientology virtually since its beginning<sup id="_ref-TimeVenus_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[1]</a></sup>: in the 1950s Hubbard wrote and lectured about civilizations such as <a href="/wiki/Helatrobus.html" title="Helatrobus">Helatrobus</a>, the <a  title="">Espinol Confederacy</a> and <a  title="">Arslycus</a>, and in the 1960s he introduced Xenu's Galactic Confederacy. He described repeated instances of their using brainwashing <a href="/wiki/Implant_%28Scientology%29.html" title="Implant (Scientology)">implants</a> on hapless beings. He also spoke of alien invasions of <a href="/wiki/Earth.html" title="Earth">Earth</a>, such as that carried out around 6235 BC by the <a  title="">Fifth Invader Force</a>, who were "very strange insect-like creature[s] with unthinkably horrible hands."</p>

<h2>Scientology and science fiction</h2>
<p>Often members of the Church will publicly deny the existence of specific space opera doctrines, or attempt to minimize their importance. <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://experts.about.com/q/Scientology-1751/L-Ron-Hubbard-space.htm?zIr=1#r">[3]</a> However, Scientology has many graduated levels through which one can progress. Many who remain at relatively 'low' levels in the church are unaware of much of the space opera doctrines, which mostly begin at <a href="/wiki/Operating_Thetan.html" title="Operating Thetan">Operating Thetan</a> level three, or "OT III". <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.xenu.net/archive/ot/">[4]</a> Because the secret information imparted to members is to be kept secret from others who have not attained that level, the member must publicly deny its existence when asked. OT III recipients must sign a waiver promising never to reveal its secrets before they are given the manila envelope containing the Xenu knowledge. <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/story/9363363/inside_scientology?rnd=1145498469125&amp;has-player=true&amp;version=6.0.12.872">[5]</a> It is knowledge so dangerous, members are told, anyone learning this material before he is ready could die.</p>
<p>Many members who remain in the <a href="/wiki/Church_of_Scientology.html" title="Church of Scientology">Church of Scientology</a> have objected to Scientology being painted as a <a href="/wiki/Science_fiction.html" title="Science fiction">science fiction</a> fantasy <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://observer.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,6903,1217884,00.html">[6]</a>. <i>Space opera</i> is defined in the <i>Official Scientology and Dianetics Glossary</i> as:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"of or relating to time periods … millions of years ago which concerned activities in this and other galaxies. Space opera has space travel, spaceships, spacemen, intergalactic travel, wars, conflicts, other beings, civilizations and societies, and other planets and galaxies. It is not fiction and concerns actual incidents and things that occurred on the [whole] track. [<i>in the past</i>]" (<i><a  class="external text" title="http://www.scientology.org/p_jpg/gloss.htm#SPACEOPERA">Official Scientology and Dianetics Glossary</a></i>)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Particularly during its early years, Scientology had many links with science fiction. Hubbard was originally a <a href="/wiki/Pulp_magazine.html" title="Pulp magazine">pulp</a> science fiction and adventure story writer, his book <i><a  title="Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health">Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health</a></i> was first publicised through <a href="/wiki/John_W._Campbell.html" title="John W. Campbell">John W. Campbell</a>'s magazine <i><a href="/wiki/Astounding_Science_Fiction.html" title="Astounding Science Fiction">Astounding Science Fiction</a></i> and many of his early followers were recruited from the science fiction milieu. Indeed, Hubbard returned to science fiction in the 1980s with his books <i><a href="/wiki/Battlefield_Earth.html" title="Battlefield Earth">Battlefield Earth</a></i> and the ten-volume <i><a href="/wiki/Mission_Earth_%28novel%29.html" title="Mission Earth (novel)">Mission Earth</a></i> series.</p>
<p>Many science-fictional references can be found in Hubbard's Scientology-related works. Scientologists could find themselves living in "<a href="/wiki/Robot.html" title="Robot">robot</a> bodies" in past lives, being killed by "<a href="/wiki/Raygun.html" title="Raygun">zap guns</a>", living aboard spaceships or flying "space wagons" capable of travelling <i>"a <a href="/wiki/Trillion.html" title="Trillion">trillion</a> <a href="/wiki/Light_year.html" title="Light year">light years</a> per day"</i>. ("The Helatrobus Implants") Scientology magazines even now are often illustrated with pictures of spaceships and exploding stars, and some Scientology books published during the 1960s and 1970s depicted science fiction scenes on their dustjackets.</p>
<p>Hubbard later dramatised the story of Xenu as a <a href="/wiki/Film.html" title="Film">film</a> script, <i>Revolt in the Stars</i>, in the late 1970s, but failed to find a studio willing to buy the work. His novels <i>Battlefield Earth</i> and <i>Mission Earth</i> are not directly related to Scientology, but critics have noted a similarity between some themes of these later novels and Scientology doctrine, particularly <i>"the very strong opposition against 20th century psychology and psychiatry, which is seen as a major source of evil."</i> <sup id="_ref-Frenschkowski_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Rather than Scientology being based on science fiction, however, Hubbard argued that science fiction was actually an unconscious recollection of real past lives that could be uncovered in detail through Scientology <a href="/wiki/Auditing_%28Scientology%29.html" title="Auditing (Scientology)">auditing</a>:</p>
<dl>
<dd>[Y]ou say, well, this is science fiction. No. No, no. No. The only part of science fiction they are, is the mistakes the science fiction writers have made while writing about their own past. ("The Helatrobus Implants")</dd>

<h2>Scientology's view of the universe</h2>
<p>Scientology doctrine holds that the human spirit is manifested as what it terms <a href="/wiki/Thetan.html" title="Thetan">thetan</a>, a spiritual being roughly corresponding to religious and philosophical conceptions of the <a href="/wiki/Soul.html" title="Soul">soul</a>, which is immortal and theoretically immensely powerful, but is currently imprisoned in mortal human bodies and unable to reach its full potential. Thetans are credited with having created the universe trillions of years ago and with having the potential for <i>"knowing and willing cause over life, thought, matter, energy, space and time"</i>: the ability to operate free of the encumbrances of the material universe.</p>
<p>However, over the <i>"trillennia"</i>, thetans have been repeatedly subjected to the depredations of beings in the material or "<a href="/wiki/MEST_%28Scientology%29.html" title="MEST (Scientology)">MEST</a>" universe. In the ongoing conflict between "theta" (good) and "entheta" (bad), material beings have captured, tortured and brainwashed thetans to make them more tractable. Xenu's galactic genocide was the most famous example of such methods but was not by any means the only such incident related in Scientology doctrine.</p>
<p>According to Hubbard, there have been many other such incidents, and alien involvement in Earth's affairs is still ongoing. The result is that thetans today are severely "aberrated" by billions of years of mistreatment in past lives, causing mental and physical problems such as illness, insanity and war. The only way to resolve this is said to be through Scientology's "auditing" or counselling methods. During Scientology auditing sessions, the Scientologist confronts and handles a series of past lives and key incidents which they may have experienced.</p>
<p>Hubbard described many key incidents on the "whole track" (<i>"the moment to moment record of a person’s existence in this universe in picture and impression form"</i> <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.scientology.org/p_jpg/gloss.htm#WHOLETRACK">[7]</a>) in his writings and lectures. He also gave details of various alien civilizations, their roles and their histories — most of which seem to have involved the mass brainwashing of thetans with "<a href="/wiki/Implant_%28Scientology%29.html" title="Implant (Scientology)">implants</a>" (false memories).</p>

<p><a name="Scientologists_and_space_opera" id="Scientologists_and_space_opera"></a></p>
<h2>Scientologists and space opera</h2>
<p>Some aspects of Scientology space opera are revealed only in higher-level Scientology courses. For instance, the story of Xenu is part of the <a href="/wiki/Operating_Thetan.html" title="Operating Thetan">Operating Thetan</a> level III course, which requires an extensive (and expensive) preparatory series of courses. Only high-level Scientologists are given access to such "Advanced Technology" materials. This has not always been the case, as the Church of Scientology was initially quite open about its beliefs in space opera. Some "advanced" material was withdrawn from public circulation from the late 1960s onwards (although old copies can still be found in some public library collections, due to the Church's energetic policy of book donations).</p>
<p>Much Scientology space opera is nonetheless still accessible to "ordinary" Scientologists and in materials which are readily available to the general public. The <i>Dianetics and Scientology Technical Dictionary</i> (<a  class="internal">ISBN 0-88404-037-2</a>) contains many definitions for extraterrestrial civilizations and brainwashing incidents, and many of L. Ron Hubbard's publicly available works contain extensive references to space opera. Within Scientology, internal magazines often publicize aspects of space opera to entry-level "<a href="/wiki/Clear_%28Scientology%29.html" title="Clear (Scientology)">preclear</a>" Scientologists. For instance, <i>International Scientology News</i> issue 3 contains an advertisement for volume 10 of Hubbard's <i>Research and Discovery Series</i> (<a  class="internal">ISBN 0-88404-218-9</a>), which says in part:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Your mind is completely <b>UNPREPARED</b> for what is about to <b>HAPPEN</b> to your <b>REALITY ...</b></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>Volume 10: The Infinite Potential of Theta</i> is unsurpassed: Nowhere will you find more knowledge about the mysterious ENTITIES, also known as theta bodies, those inhabitants of every human being that talk to him, and lead him astray. Nowhere are you likely to find more concentrated data about the <i>BETWEEN LIVES AREAS</i> and LRH's eye-popping discovery of <i><a  title="">BODIES IN PAWN</a></i>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Do YOU have a body in pawn?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Read <i>Volume 10</i>, for once you know ALL about it, you won't have to worry about nightmares, inexplicable <a href="/wiki/Somatic.html" title="Somatic">somatics</a>, disturbing visio images of cylindrical tanks, bodies floating in green fluid ...</dd>
<dd>(<i>International Scientology News</i> issue 3, 1997; formatting as per original)</dd>
</dl>
<p>It is not clear to what degree the typical Scientologist personally shares the official belief in "space opera", though the above advertisement features in an "entry-level" publication. The views of a number of individual Scientologists were recorded in the 1960 book <i><a href="/wiki/Have_You_Lived_Before_This_Life%3F.html" title="Have You Lived Before This Life?">Have You Lived Before This Life?</a></i> (<a  class="internal">ISBN 0-88404-958-2</a>). It describes "past life" episodes as recounted by 43 Scientologists undergoing Scientology auditing during a conference in <a href="/wiki/London.html" title="London">London</a> in 1958 <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://198.95.10.34/book/html/sl12m.htm">[8]</a>. The participants in the conference reported having lived past lives including the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>A past life as a robot working in a factory in space, which had gold animals hanging around it which <i>"appeared solid but periodically imploded or exploded"</i>. It ground up discs to make small animals, which were then <i>"inflated after blowing up through a totem and a cat devil"</i> before being sent to other planets. A planet blew up, and the robot was blamed. He was drugged and forced to work the grinder.</li>
<li>A past life <i>"55,<a href="/wiki/Quintillion.html" title="Quintillion">000,000,000,000,000,000</a> years ago"</i> in which the being had to do outside repairs on a space ship. He suffered radiation burns and fell off, plunging into an ocean on the planet below. A <a href="/wiki/Manta_ray.html" title="Manta ray">manta ray</a> killed him and he in turn inhabited the manta ray.</li>
<li>A past life as a trouble-making free being on <a href="/wiki/Mars_%28planet%29.html" title="Mars (planet)">Mars</a> <i>"469,476,600 years ago"</i>. He tried to inhabit a "doll body", but he was captured and beaten up. The being was zapped with a ray gun by a Martian bishop in front of a congregation chanting <i>"God is Love"</i>, before being run over by a large car and a steamroller. He was then frozen in an ice cube and dropped on Planet ZX 432, where he took another robot body and zapped and killed another robot. He took off in a <a href="/wiki/Flying_saucer.html" title="Flying saucer">flying saucer</a>, and died when it exploded.</li>
<li>A past life in which a being went to a planet where the forces of good were fighting evil black magic forces. After 74,000 years of battle, implants and hallucinations, he lost the fight, and joined the black magic side. He went to another planet on a space ship, where he was <i>"deceived into a love affair with a robot decked out as a beautiful red-haired girl."</i></li>
<li>Being transformed into an intergalactic <a href="/wiki/Walrus.html" title="Walrus">walrus</a> which perished after falling out of a flying saucer.</li>
<li>Being <i>"a very happy being who strayed to the planet Nostra 23,064,000,000 years ago"</i>.</li>

The volcano on the cover of <i>Dianetics</i> is conjectured to refer to the Xenu story; according to Hubbard, <i>"man responds to an exploding volcano."</i></div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Non-Scientologists have, on the whole, not reacted with much sympathy to Scientology space opera. However, Hubbard claimed that the power of past life implants was such that non-Scientologists would involuntarily react to depictions of space opera incidents. In the wake of Hubbard's revelation of Xenu's act of mass murder, images from the Xenu story and the related implants were exploited to improve Scientology's recruitment prospects.</p>
<p>Hubbard is reported to have ordered that Scientology books be reissued with covers based on images from OT III <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.religio.de/atack/occ4.html#108">[9]</a>. The 1968 and subsequent reprints of <i><a  title="Dianetics">Dianetics</a></i> have had covers depicting an exploding volcano, apparently alluding to the volcanoes in the Xenu story — <i>"Man responds to an exploding volcano"</i> (Hubbard, "Assists"). Other cover images may reference Xenu as well: the cover of the 1972 edition of <i><a  title="Dianetics: The Evolution of a Science">Dianetics: The Evolution of a Science</a></i> shows pictures of uniformed men in white helmets carrying boxes in and out of a spaceship, which may refer to the transportation of Xenu's victims. These images were supposed to have a lasting impact on non-Scientologists:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A special 'Book Mission' was sent out to promote these books, now empowered and made irresistible by the addition of these overwhelming symbols or images. Organization staff were assured that if they simply held up one of the books, revealing its cover, that any bookstore owner would immediately order crateloads of them. A customs officer, seeing any of the book covers in one's luggage, would immediately pass one on through.<br />
(Corydon)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since the 1980s, the volcano has also been depicted in television commercials advertising <i>Dianetics</i>.</p>

<h3>Arslycus</h3>
<p><b>Arslycus</b> (pronounced "ars-LYE-cus") was an ancient civilization located in space, rather than on a planet, as this was at a time when <i>"nobody had invented planets yet."</i> Hubbard described it as being notorious for its mind-numbingly tedious jobs, putting thetans to work for <i>"ten thousand lives in Arslycus, on the average"</i>, spent doing nothing better than polishing bricks.</p>
<p>The civilization was ultimately destroyed when <i>"one of these slaves suddenly got the big idea of mass"</i> and Arslycus <i>"broke to pieces and scattered around in that particular part of the sky as being of too great a mass to sustain itself"</i>. This was, apparently, <i>"about the point where you got the law of gravity coming in strongly. And after that the law of gravity began to affect itself on the universe more and more and more and more and you started to get all kinds of suns and planets and the most fantastic array of things."</i> (<i>Philadelphia Doctorate Course</i> lectures, <a href="/wiki/December_1.html" title="December 1">1 December</a> <a href="/wiki/1952.html" title="1952">1952</a>)</p>

<h3>Espinol Confederacy</h3>
<p>The <b>Espinol Confederacy</b> is a lesser but apparently still extant alien civilization, said by Hubbard to have lasted <i>"something on the order of a few hundred thousand years."</i> ("The ITSA Line") It used to control Earth's Solar System, which was "Sun 12" of the "Espinol United Stars" (formal name: <i>"Espinol United Stars, or the Espinol United Moons, Planets, and Asteroids: This Quarter of the Universe is Ours"</i>). The Espinols abandoned the Solar System in AD 1150, <i>"when a group on Mars was finally abolished and vanished"</i>, and since then have used the system as a dumping ground for convicts.

It ruled a broad swath of the galaxy, and lasted for <i>"eighty trillion years"</i>. ("The ITSA Line") 75 million years ago, at the time of Xenu's mass murder, the Galactic Confederacy comprised 26 stars and 76 planets, including Earth (then called Teegeeack). Its inhabitants <i>"were walking around in clothes which looked very remarkably like the clothes they wear this very minute. And the cars they drove looked exactly the same and the trains they ran looked the same and the boats they had looked the same. Circa 1950, 1960."</i> ("Assists") Modern civilization closely resembles that of the Galactic Confederacy 75 million years ago because of an unconscious re-enactment of Xenu's "<a  title="">R6 implants</a>".</p>

The <a href="/wiki/Himalaya.html" title="Himalaya">Himalaya</a>, said by Hubbard to be the site of the defeat of the Third Battalion of the Fifth Invader Force, circa 6235 BC.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>According to Hubbard, the Solar System has been occupied repeatedly — and sometimes concurrently — by multiple <b>Invader Forces</b>. They were discussed in detail in a 1952 lecture, "The Role of Earth", in which Hubbard described the conflict between the Fourth Invader Force (already occupying the Solar System) and the Fifth Invader Force (which invaded without knowing that the Fourth Invader Force was already in residence).</p>
<p>The Fifth Invader Force renamed the Solar System as <i>"Space Station 33"</i> but <i>"without suspecting that the Fourth Invader Force had been there for God knows how many skillion years, had been sitting down, and they have their installations up on Mars, and they have a tremendous, screened operation"</i>. The result was a major clash between the two Invader Forces some 8,200 years ago in the <a href="/wiki/Himalaya.html" title="Himalaya">Himalayas</a>, when the Third Battalion of the Fifth Invader Force landed about 72 miles (116 km) northwest of the <a href="/wiki/Khyber_Pass.html" title="Khyber Pass">Khyber Pass</a> and attempted to set up an implant station. The battalion was captured, taken to the Fourth Invaders' complex on <a href="/wiki/Mars_%28planet%29.html" title="Mars (planet)">Mars</a>, brainwashed and stuck into human bodies. As for the remainder,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the Fifth Invader Force, out of its own protection, took over <a href="/wiki/Venus_%28planet%29.html" title="Venus (planet)">Venus</a> – oh, relatively in modern times – took over Venus and tried to stabilize the Venusian[s]. If you called a Fifth Invader, though, a Venusian, he would probably shoot you out of hand, because it would be a horrible insult. They merely monitor the government of Venus, and they leave Mars strictly alone.<br />
("The Role of Earth")</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Many present-day thetans are said to have been former members of the Fifth Invader Force and can be distinguished by the fact that they believe themselves to be <i>"a very strange insectlike creature with unthinkably horrible hands."</i> (<i>Scientology 8-8008</i>)</p>
<p>The Invader Forces are still said to be controlling <i>"installations in <a href="/wiki/Mongolia.html" title="Mongolia">Mongolia</a> … installations in the Pyrenees here on Earth, and there are installations down in the <a href="/wiki/Mountains_of_the_Moon.html" title="Mountains of the Moon">Mountains of the Moon</a> in Africa which pick up, very often, people on death."

<h3>Marcab Confederacy</h3>
<p>The <b>Marcab Confederacy</b> is said to be one of the most powerful galactic civilizations still active. He describes it as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>various planets united into a very vast civilization which has come forward up through the last 200,000 years, formed out of the fragments of earlier civilizations. In the last 10,000 years they have gone on with a sort of decadent kicked-in-the-head civilization that contains automobiles, business suits, fedora hats, telephones, spaceships — a civilization which looks almost an exact duplicate but is worse off than the current US civilization.<br />

<p>The capital of the Confederacy is said to be <i>"one of the tail stars of the <a href="/wiki/Big_Dipper.html" title="Big Dipper">Big Dipper</a>"</i>, probably <a href="/wiki/Alkaid.html" title="Alkaid">Alkaid</a>, a star 108 <a href="/wiki/Light_year.html" title="Light year">light years</a> distant from Earth.

<p>The Marcabians had an oppressive political system: <i>"if [a person] was considered to be in contempt of court or anything like that, [he was] simply fried since there was a curtain of radioactive material which went clear across the front of the bench anywhere that a witness or anybody would stand, and so on."</i> ("History and development of processes: question and answer period") They invented <a href="/wiki/Income_tax.html" title="Income tax">income tax</a> as a means of punishment, with the <a href="/wiki/Death_penalty.html" title="Death penalty">death penalty</a> imposed for making even the slightest mistake in returns — <i>"one comma wrong and it's 'dead forever'."</i> The Marcabians also appear to have been distinctly socialistic, having <i>"had plan balanced economies"</i> (presumably some form of <a href="/wiki/Planned_economy.html" title="Planned economy">planned economy</a>). ("E-Meter Actions, Errors in Auditing")</p>
<p>They were also keen on <a href="/wiki/Motor_racing.html" title="Motor racing">motor racing</a> and every once in a while Scientologists undergoing auditing <i>"will run into [memories of] race tracks and race-track drivers"</i>. Hubbard described this in some detail in a 1960 lecture:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They had turbine-generated cars that went about 275 miles an hour (443 km/h). They ran with a high whine. I notice they've just now invented the motor again. And they had tracks that were booby-trapped with atom bombs, and they had side bypasses. The tracks were mined, and the grandstands were leaded-paned.<br />
("Create and Confront")</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The tracks were deliberately designed to be as dangerous as possible, with <i>"a mountain that you went up to the top of and fell off"</i>, and death was commonplace. This, however, was not a problem, as Marcabian medicine was so good that nobody ever died permanently. According to author <a href="/wiki/Russell_Miller.html" title="Russell Miller">Russell Miller</a>, Hubbard liked to reminisce to his followers about <i>"how he was a race-car driver in the Marcab civilization"</i>. One of the people who accompanied him aboard his private fleet in the late 1960s described Hubbard's stories of life with the Marcabians:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>LRH said he was a race driver called the Green Dragon who set a speed record before he was killed in an accident. He came back in another lifetime as the Red Devil and beat his own record, then came back and did it again as the Blue Streak. Finally he realized all he was doing was breaking his own records and it was no game any more.<br />
(Miller, p.280)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hubbard describes exactly this in his lecture "Create and Confront", telling how he went through multiple lives as a Marcabian racing driver with names like The Green Rocket, The Red Comet, The Silver Streak, The Gold Bomb, and so on.</p>
<p>Hubbard stated that the Marcab Confederacy was now using Earth as a "prison planet". When a person dies or "drops the body", as Scientologists put it, his thetan is pulled into a Marcab-established "implant station" or "report station". The idea that Earth is a <i>"prison planet"</i>, maintained by <i>"entheta beings"</i> or <i>Targs</i> who dumped their enemies on Earth, was first put forward in a 1952 lecture, "Electropsychometric Scouting: Battle of the Universes". A steady flow of flying saucers is said to be still dropping off more entheta beings.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The report area for most has been <a href="/wiki/Mars_%28planet%29.html" title="Mars (planet)">Mars</a>. Some women report to stations elsewhere in the <a href="/wiki/Solar_System.html" title="Solar System">Solar System</a>. There are occasional incidents about Earth report stations. The report stations are protected by screens. The last report station on Earth was established in the <a href="/wiki/Pyrenees.html" title="Pyrenees">Pyrenees</a>.<br />
(<i>Scientology: A History of Man</i>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The thetans are brainwashed and sent back to Earth, where they find a new body to inhabit. Only Scientologists who have reached the level of "<a href="/wiki/Operating_Thetan.html" title="Operating Thetan">Operating Thetan</a>" are said to be able to avoid this fate.</p>

<h3>Other alien civilizations</h3>
<p>Hubbard mentions a number of other alien civilizations in his writings, though he does not go into any detail about them. These include the <i>"Three-and-a-half Invaders, ... the Psi Galaxy, Galaxy 82."</i> ("The Story of a Static") According to the official Church of Scientology notes accompanying the lectures in which he alluded to them, these were <i>"made up"</i> (presumably for humorous effect), contrasting with the supposedly real invader forces and civilizations cited above.</p>

<h2>Key incidents</h2>
<p>In his writings and lectures, Hubbard describes many key incidents said to have occurred to thetans during the past few trillion years. Generally speaking, these followed a consistent pattern. A hostile alien civilization would capture free thetans and brainwash them with implants designed to confuse them or otherwise render them more amenable to control. Instances of implantation are termed <i>incidents</i>, while the subject of the implants are often termed <i>goals</i>.</p>
<p>In a specific incident, a thetan would be implanted with two or more opposing objectives (e.g. "to be", "not to be") which, being opposed, cause the thetan great confusion. The memory of the implanting then becomes obscured or is deliberately deleted. This confusion is said to linger for trillions of years and causes unresolved psychological problems in the present day. According to Hubbard, only Scientology methods can resolve the burdens left by such traumas.</p>

<h3>Aircraft Door Goals</h3>
<p>The <b>Aircraft Door Goals</b> were implanted between 315 trillion years ago and 216 trillion years ago aboard the fuselage of an aircraft, with the thetan held motionless in front of the aircraft door. Hubbard writes that <i>"the goal items were laid in with explosions"</i>. The specific goals given in this implant were variants of the command "to create."

<h3>Bodies in pawn</h3>
<p><b>Bodies in pawn</b> result from an ancient "very gruesome experience" in which</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a fellow is grabbed, hypnotized, shoved into an electronic field, and then told he is somewhere else. And so he departs – most of him – and goes to the new location while still being under control of the implanters. He picks up a MEST [physical] body in the new location and starts living a life there, <i>while still having a living body somewhere else</i>. The implanters can keep his original body alive indefinitely, and control the thetan through it. If the thetan tries to flee, the hypnotizers simply cause pain to the original body, still alive in a vat of fluid, and he is immediately recalled. That's a BODY IN PAWN. It's a second body you may have, living somewhere else, right in present time. But the second body is not under YOUR direct control.<br />
(<i>Adventure</i> magazine, Church of Scientology, 1998; see also Hubbard, <i>Research and Discovery Series</i> vol. 10)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They can apparently cause major problems for people undergoing medical operations, as <i>"pain, an anaesthetic or a serious accident cause him to change to the other area with a shocking impact on the other body. The other body quite commonly dies or is deranged by the sudden impact."</i> This gives the patient a repressed feeling of having died and leaves him "very, very badly disturbed."

</div>
</div>
<p>The <b>Gorilla Goals</b> were a series of implants created by invaders from Helatrobus <i>"between about 319 trillion years ago to about 256 trillion trillion years ago"</i> (or 89 trillion trillion years ago in another Hubbard lecture<sup title="The text in the vicinity of this tag needs citation." class="noprint">[<a  title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><i>citation&#160;needed</i></a>]</sup>). They were</p>
<blockquote>
<p>given in an amusement park with a single tunnel, a roller coaster and a Ferris wheel ... The symbol of a Gorilla was always present in the place the goal was given. Sometimes a large gorilla, black, was seen elsewhere than the park. A mechanical or a live gorilla was always seen in the park.</p>
<p>This activity was conducted by the Hoipolloi, a group of operators in meat body societies. They were typical carnival people. They let out concessions for these implant "Amusement Parks." A pink-striped white shirt with sleeve garters was the uniform of the Hoipolloi. Such a figure often rode on the roller coaster cars. Monkeys were also used on the cars. Elephants sometimes formed part of the equipment.<br />
("Routine 3N: Line Plots", HCOB <a href="/wiki/July_14.html" title="July 14">14 July</a> <a href="/wiki/1963.html" title="1963">1963</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Hoipolloi used <i>"fantastic motion"</i> as well as <i>"blasts of raw electricity and explosions"</i> to brainwash the hapless thetans into accepting the Gorilla Goals. The goals themselves were a series of simple tasks intended to trick the thetans into limiting their inherent abilities, with the goals including "To End", "To be Dead", "To be Asleep", "To be Solid", "To be Sexual" and so on.</p>

In the second series, Heaven had become a lot shabbier:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The place is shabby. The vegetation is gone. The pillars are scruffy. The saints have vanished. So have the Angels. A sign on one (the left as you "enter") says "This is Heaven". The right has a sign "Hell" with an arrow and inside the grounds one can see the excavations like archaeological diggings with raw terraces, that lead to "Hell".</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hubbard reported that he had encountered no <i>"devils or satans"</i>. Heaven was, however, not quite as conventionally depicted, and took the form of a town which <i>"consisted of a trolley bus, some building fronts, sidewalks, train tracks, a boarding house, a bistro in a basement where there is a "bulletin board" well lighted, and a BANK BUILDING."</i> Hubbard described how the second series of Heaven implants depicts:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a passenger getting on the trolley bus, a "workman" halfway down the first stairs of To Forget "eating lunch" and in To Be in Heaven a gardener or electrician adjusting an implant box behind a hedge and periodically leaping up and screaming.<br />
