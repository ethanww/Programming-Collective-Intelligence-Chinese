<h2>English Civil War</h2>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/1642.html" title="1642">1642</a>, during the early stages of the <a href="/wiki/First_English_Civil_War#Overview.html" title="First English Civil War">English Civil War</a>, local forces were everywhere employed by whichever side could, by producing valid written authority, induce them to assemble. The two most common authorities used were, on the side of the <a href="/wiki/Roundheads.html" title="Roundheads">Parliament</a>, its own recent "<a  class="new" title="Militia Ordinance">Militia Ordinance</a>"; or that of the king, the old-fashioned "<a href="/wiki/Commission_of_Array.html" title="Commission of Array">Commissions of Array</a>". But the <a href="/wiki/Cavaliers_%28royalists%29.html" title="Cavaliers (royalists)">Royalist</a> leader in <a href="/wiki/Cornwall.html" title="Cornwall">Cornwall</a>, Sir <a href="/wiki/Ralph_Hopton.html" title="Ralph Hopton">Ralph Hopton</a>, indicted the enemy before the <a href="/wiki/Grand_jury.html" title="Grand jury">grand jury</a> of the county as disturbers of the peace, and had the <i>posse comitatus</i> called out to expel them.</p>

<h2>Modern usage</h2>
<p>With modern methods of <a href="/wiki/Law_enforcement.html" title="Law enforcement">law enforcement</a>, the <i>posse comitatus</i> is generally obsolete. The power presumably continues to exist in those <a href="/wiki/U.S._state.html" title="U.S. state">U.S. states</a> that have not repealed it by <a href="/wiki/Statute.html" title="Statute">statute</a>, however. Resort to the <i>posse comitatus</i> figures often in the <a href="/wiki/Plot.html" title="Plot">plots</a> of <a href="/wiki/Western_movie.html" title="Western movie">Western movies</a>, where the body of men recruited is frequently referred to as a <i>posse</i>. Based on this usage, the word <i>posse</i> has come to be used <a href="/wiki/Colloquialism.html" title="Colloquialism">colloquially</a> to refer to various teams, cliques, or gangs. In a number of states, especially in the western United States, sheriffs and other law enforcement agencies have called their civilian auxiliary groups "posses." The <a href="/wiki/Lattimer_Massacre.html" title="Lattimer Massacre">Lattimer Massacre</a> of <a href="/wiki/1897.html" title="1897">1897</a> illustrated the danger of such groups, and thus ended their use in situations of <a href="/wiki/Civil_unrest.html" title="Civil unrest">civil unrest</a>.</p>
<p>In the <a href="/wiki/United_States.html" title="United States">United States</a>, a Federal statute known as the <a href="/wiki/Posse_Comitatus_Act.html" title="Posse Comitatus Act">Posse Comitatus Act</a> forbids the use of the <a href="/wiki/Military_of_the_United_States.html" title="Military of the United States">military of the United States</a> as a <i>posse comitatus</i> or for law enforcement purposes.</p>
<p>The practical disuse of the <i>posse comitatus</i>, and its continued twilight existence as a theoretical legal power, is, like the <a href="/wiki/Militia.html" title="Militia">militia</a>, a subject for the debates about the meaning of the <a href="/wiki/Second_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution.html" title="Second Amendment to the United States Constitution">U.S. Constitution Second Amendment</a>.</p>

<h3>History of the Posse Comitatus in English Law</h3>
<p>The term <b>posse comitatus</b>, literally translated as the power of the county, first appeared in English law in 1411 with the passage of a riot act calling for the sheriffs and justice of the peace together with the <a  class="new" title="Poair de counte">poair de counte</a> to arrest rioters (13 Hen. 4, c.7 (1411)). However the concept of a posse comitatus can be traced back to the Assize of Arms (1181) and the creation of the <a  class="new" title="Jurata ad arma">jurata ad arma</a>, an armed body of men at the disposal of the King for the purposes of keeping the peace. The role of the jurata ad arma was further cemented with the passage of the Statute of Winchester (13 Edw. 1, stat. 2, c.4 (1285)), a section of which called for the jurata ad arma to respond to the <a href="/wiki/Hue_and_cry.html" title="Hue and cry">hue and cry</a> for the pursuit of malefactors and peacekeeping. However the separation of the military and the militia from civil law enforcement had been developed earlier in the century with the signing of the Magna Carta (1215, revised 1225). Chapter 39 of the revised version of the Magna Carta (1225) prohibited the imprisonment or punishment of a <a href="/wiki/Freeman.html" title="Freeman">freeman</a> except by his peers or the law of the land.</p>
<p>The apparent conflict between the rights enshrined in the Magna Carta and the establishment of a permanent posse comitatus by statutes in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries continued until the time of the English Revolution in the seventeenth century. By 1623 the statutory basis for the jurata ad arma had been repealed (21 Jac. 1, c.28 (1623)), however King Charles 1 continued to use martial force to control the country. Parliament�s resistance to Charles� claims to the militia provided one of the major factors leading to the Civil War (1642-4. By the end of the seventeenth century and the restoration of the monarchy the role of the posse comitatus had been more clearly defined, it was to work within the confines of the law and would be separate from a militia. The Bill of Rights (1 W. &amp; Mary, sess.2, c.2 (1688)) further confirmed the exclusion of the military from the role of civil law enforcement.</p>
<p>In the eighteenth century the posse comitatus was once again used to control riots, however the 1714 Riot Act (1Geo. 1, stat.2, c.5 (1714)) clearly intended the posse comitatus to be under the control of civil not military authorities, and for those arrested to be subject to the due process of the law of the land and not martial law. William Blackstone in his Commentaries on the Laws of England, made clear that the separation of the military from civil law enforcement was an essential component of the legal system (1 Comm. 400), however he also recognized the need for a posse comitatus for �keeping the peace and pursuing the felons� (1 Comm. 343).</p>
<p>In 1780 a series of riots in London were eventually suppressed by the use of soldiers. In discussing the legal ramifications of this action Parliament agreed with Lord Chief Justice Mansfield who declared that all civil riots should be put down by civil authorities and the posse comitatus, never by military authorities. Further that even if soldiers comprise the posse comitatus they are deemed to be acting in a civil capacity and are thus subject to civilian laws. This policy of soldier as civilian came to be known as the Mansfield Doctrine and was to be the controlling policy on the role of the posse comitatus in England. For more information on the development of the Mansfield Doctrine see David Engdhal, The Legal Background and Aftermath of the Kent State Tragedy, 22 Cleveland State Law Review 3 (1973). Engdahl also provides a very useful description of the evolution of the posse comitatus in English law in Soldiers Riots and Revolution: The Law and History of Military Troops in Civil Disorders, 57 Iowa Law Review 1 (1971). Another useful history of the topic can be found at the beginning of Charles Doyle�s The Posse Comitatus Act &amp; Related Matters: The Use of the Military to Execute Civilian Law (2000).</p>

<h3>The History of the Posse Comitatus in American Law</h3>
<p>The American experience with the posse comitatus began in the colonial period with the repeated use of military troops to suppress disorders in the colonies. The violation of the due process principles outlined in colonial charters was most apparent in the Boston massacre of 1770 when rioters were fired upon by the army. The army had been sent to Boston to act as a police force, the responsibility of civil authorities, rather than as a security force. Following the Revolution the founding fathers incorporated strong due process principles into the Constitution, however they also allowed for the use of the militia to execute the laws of the Union (U.S. Const. Art I, s.8, cl.15, 16). David Engdahl provides an excellent summary of the debates over the use of the military and the militia during the Constitutional Convention in Soldiers Riots and Revolution: The Law and History of Military Troops in Civil Disorders, 57 Iowa Law Review 1 (1971).</p>
<p>During the first 70 years of the new country the principles of due process and an adoption of the Mansfield Doctrine prevailed. While militiamen and soldiers were occasionally called to supplement the civilian peace keeping forces they were viewed strictly as a civilian posse and thus held liable under ordinary law. The turning point for this application of the Mansfield Doctrine occurred shortly before the Civil War. A federal marshal, in carrying out provisions of the Fugitive Slave Act 1850, sought reimbursement from the government for funds he had paid a posse comitatus comprised of police and militiamen. In responding to the claim the then U.S. Attorney General, Caleb Cushing, overruled the Mansfield Doctrine and declared that a posse comitatus could consist of soldiers acting in their military capacity (6 Op. Att�y Gen. 466, 473 (1854)). This overhaul of government policy toward a posse comitatus was to continue throughout the Civil War period when the military was used on numerous occasions for apparently civilian peace keeping duty.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: The Posse Comitatus Act">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="The_Posse_Comitatus_Act" id="The_Posse_Comitatus_Act"></a></p>
<h3>The Posse Comitatus Act</h3>
<p>The Posse Comitatus Act of 1878 was a direct response to the increasing use of the military for civilian purposes in the Reconstruction period following the Civil War. On many occasions troops had been used to quell civil disturbances, to help form governments in the southern states, and to enforce civil laws. This issue came to a head when Rutherford B Hayes won the disputed presidential election of 1876. Accusations were quickly made that troops sent to the southern states to act as a posse comitatus for federal marshals at the polls assisted in providing the President with the essential votes. In 1878 a Democrat controlled House of Representatives passed an army appropriations bill (20 Stat 145, 152) which contained language expressly prohibiting the use of the army as a posse comitatus. The act therefore rejected the Mansfield Doctrine that troops could be used in a civilian capacity as long as they were subject to civilian law, and equated the use of troops with martial law.</p>
<p>The text of the act has essentially remained unaltered except for the addition of the Air Force in 1956 (70A Stat 626 (1956), however Congress has created expansions to the number of statutory exceptions to the act (e.g., 10 USC 331, 10 USC 332 and 10 USC 371-82).</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: The Application of the Posse Comitatus Act">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="The_Application_of_the_Posse_Comitatus_Act" id="The_Application_of_the_Posse_Comitatus_Act"></a></p>
<h3>The Application of the Posse Comitatus Act</h3>
<p>The language of the Act calls for two instances when the Act does not apply; when an exception is expressly authorized by the Constitution, and when Congress expressly authorizes an exception. The first of these provisions has created much confusion in the application of the Act since the Constitution contains no provision expressly authorizing the use of the military to enforce the law. Much of the literature discussing the constitutional exceptions of the Act therefore focuses upon the conflict between the implied and inherent constitutional powers of the President as Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces.</p>
<p>The second provision allowing for exceptions to the Act, Congressional authorization, has been applied in two ways; by providing a branch of the armed services with civilian law enforcement capabilities, and by establishing rules for specific types of assistance, thereby tailoring specific statutory exceptions to fit particular circumstances. In the first instance Congress has expressly authorized the Coast Guard to carry out law enforcement duties during peacetime, most notably enforcement of anti-drug laws (14 USC 2). In times of war authority for the Coast Guard transfers from the Department of Transportation to the Navy, however under the statutory exceptions created by Congress the Coast Guard can still fulfill its law enforcement duties. It should be noted that the Navy and Marine Corps have been brought under the Posse Comitatus Act by DoD Directive 5525.5 (1986, as amended 1989) and by Secretary of the Navy Instruction (SECNAVINST) 5820.7B (1988).</p>
<p>Second, Congress has enacted numerous pieces of legislation permitting the use of military assistance and equipment in aiding civilian law enforcement (see in particular 10 USC 371-82). Most of this legislation originated in 1981 following the �Wounded Knee� cases. These cases stemmed from the 1973 take-over of a facility on the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota, and the subsequent siege, arrest and trial of members of the American Indian Movement (AIM). During the course of the siege the federal civilian law enforcement authorities made extensive use of material, personnel and equipment provided by the military. The assistance provided by the military ultimately led to the undermining of the charges against those arrested, and it became clear that Congress needed to address the need for statutory exclusions to the original Act. In addition to statutory exceptions concerning providing civil law enforcement with assistance, Congress has also enacted legislation providing for exceptions during times of civil disturbance (10 USC 331, 10 USC 332). The regulations promulgated under these statutes provide for the protection of federal property and government functions, and authorizes the use of the military in states of emergency when civil authorities are unable to control the situation (32 CFR 215.1-.10). Additional legislation has been enacted covering instances when nuclear material is involved in an emergency (18 USC 831(e)).</p>

<p><a name="Conclusion" id="Conclusion"></a></p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>At first glance it would appear that the Posse Comitatus Act 1878 embodies the principle of the separation of the military from civilian law enforcement, a principle that has been an essential component of Anglo-American legal history since the Magna Carta. However, it is interesting to note that no one has ever been convicted of violating 18 USC 1385, and when needed Congress has been quick to create statutory exceptions as permitted by the Act. The Act has therefore succeeded in putting forth an ideal, but has fallen woefully short in creating a practical, legal impediment to the use of the military for civil law enforcement. It could even be argued that the Act has only served to legitimize the military role of a posse comitatus by providing Congress with the ability to create its own exceptions whenever the need arises. It will be interesting to see whether the Act continues to receive heightened attention over the next few years, and whether demands for amendments to and/or repeal of the Act are raised.</p>
