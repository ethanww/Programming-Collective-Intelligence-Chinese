<h3><a href="/wiki/Daniel_Webster.html" title="Daniel Webster">Daniel Webster</a></h3>
<p>Second Nomination for FA following its recent second PR. I'm very happy with its prose and I think it does an excellent job of covering Webster's career. It also recently achieved A-Class status. I've contributed significantly to the article since June and support its nomination. <a  title="User:TonyJoe">TonyJoe</a> 10:10, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Certainly much better than most of the political articles on Wikipedia. I would recommend reading through Schlesinger's <i>Age of Jackson</i>, however, as a point of view which seems somewhat underrepresented on the source list. <a  title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> 17:36, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Unfortunately, the most access that I have to Schesinger is a paragraph from <i>The Age of Jackson</i> quoted in <a href="/wiki/A_People%27s_History_of_the_United_States.html" title="A People's History of the United States">A People's History of the United States</a>. But if you can manage any useful Webster related viewpoints from Schlesinger, it would of course be a welcome addition. <a  title="User:TonyJoe">TonyJoe</a> 07:30, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. For a political article it seems to be free of POV rewrites, but that's a good thing. I'd be willing to locate additional sources if needed. However, this is a good article. --<a  title="User:TheM62Manchester">TheM62Manchester</a> 22:26, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Support</b> This article is well written and clearly laid out. Assertions are support (though <a  title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis's</a> suggestion would be helpful) and this article is without a POV. —<a  title="User:David618"><font color="#002BB8">David618</font></a>&#160;<sup><a  title="User talk:David618"><font color="#002BB8">t</font></a>&#160;<a  title="User:David618/Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></a></sup> 17:46, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Support</b> <a  title="User:Rlevse">Rlevse</a> 11:57, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Neutral</b> On examining it much more closely, I find it is based almost entirely on <a href="/wiki/Henry_Cabot_Lodge.html" title="Henry Cabot Lodge">Henry Cabot Lodge</a>'s 1883 life of Webster, lightly salted with <a href="/wiki/Profiles_in_Courage.html" title="Profiles in Courage">Profiles in Courage</a>, and omitting Lodge's occasional severe criticism. The result is a list of the offices Webster held and the great speeches he made; omitting all else. It is as neutral as a biographical dictionary because it has the same omissions. This may genuinely be the best Wikipedia is capable of; I stand by my view that most of the political articles are far worse. Revamping it by including a modern biography, with Webster's politics and his problems, would almost certainly make it unstable. Comments? <a  title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> 15:22, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li><b>Comments, yes</b>- I think it's a bit unfair to claim that the article "ommits all else" with regards to Webster's "politics and his problems." I think that the article does clearly show flaws. For instance, that Webster was in the pocket of the New England Elite and as a legislator, when their identity changed from shippers to manufacturers, his position on the tariff changed effortlessly. This unattractive bit of Webster is made more unsavory when but next to the fact that he often employed their "subscriptions" against his constant personal debt, boardering on bribery; while the article by no means makes that judgement, it does present present the shadowy facts.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>As I said on the talk page, you're right about me omitting Lodge's criticism of Seventh of March and as I explained it there, I sort of skipped over that chapter because I assumed it would be similar to Kennedy's take on the speech so I just went with Kennedy's (which I had already read) and saved myself the trouble of reading Lodge's. I was of course wrong and I've since gone through it and added Lodge's criticism of the speech which was a pretty good take on Webster's inconsistencies with regard to compromise. The quotes I picked out were slightly different from the ones you favored on the Talk Page, so you might want to add to them or change them as you see fit.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>On the talk page you gave a list of things from a variety of sources that I think you'd like to see added. There were some there that I agreed with and some that I didn't agree with, but in my opinion, most of those points were minor (Webster's take on indians and calling the Dartmouth peoration nonsense stand out in my mind) and their absence doesn't in my opinion pose any hinderance in a reader's ability to understand Webster, though others like Remini's take on Webster's lack of legislative ability, could certainly be useful in drawing into focus Webster's conspicuous lack of legislative accomplishments of his own. Even so, I still maintain that it's a minor point when compared with Webster's bribery and flip flopping on compromise and that though the article it could benefit from it, it is still comprehensive, well written, and neutral in its exposure of Webster's flaws, virtues, and inconsistencies, thus still deserving of FA status.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>So those are my comments. I hope that no matter what happens with the candidacy we'll be able to continue to work together on the article to implement the stuff that you think needs to be added and hopefully, while still respecting the article's current integrity (if you could do it Schlesinger you could probably do it with the other stuff too). Cheers, <a  title="User:TonyJoe">TonyJoe</a> 03:21, 1 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>This was not an objection, but a proposal to accept the article as it stands; however, I am certainly willing to update. Some of the omitted points are minor; but others (like Webster's speech on conscription) are not. <a  title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> 18:09, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Support</b> Those who have been maintaining this article have done a great job. It's well-sourced, well written and noticably free of biases and POV. The layout is also quite attractive, with appropriately placed photographs and excerpts. In addition, the article isn't absurdly long and each section has a proper amount of material. I also want to point out that prior to my reading this I knew fairly little about Webster aside from that he argued at his first trial in my hometown. Well done... already we know that this is a decent article since it has been approved for A-class status. -<a  title="User:Prezboy1">Prezboy1</a> 11:10, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Support</b> It's well-written and comprehensive, and the criticism (both praise and exposure of flaws) is balanced well for an encyclopedia article. The section on Webster's tenure as Secretary of State under Tyler seems a bit short and cursory compared to the coverage of the rest of his career, but that's a minor issue. <a  title="User:Absecon 59">Absecon 59</a> 13:43, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. I found the prose heavy on dramatization. I removed the obvious ones, but at many places, since the sentences were referenced, I was not able to. I am quite sure that at many places, the reference isn't as dramatized as the article puts it. I have noted some suggestions in the prose by adding comments. Since I am not sure that the references back up the statements in the prose, as well as my being unfamiliar with the subject and not in a position to comment on comprehensiveness concerns as others have pointed out, I cannot support the prose. I can also not oppose the prose because I have not provided any actionable concerns. — <a  title="User:Ambuj.Saxena">Ambuj Saxena</a> (<a  title="User talk:Ambuj.Saxena">talk</a>) 12:28, 8 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>BTW, I had to fix the license tag of <a  title="Image:WebsterbyLamb.jpg">WebsterbyLamb.jpg</a>, that had a {{<a  title="Template:Fairuseunsure">Fairuseunsure</a>}} tag. I am surprised that nobody noticed that before me. — <a  title="User:Ambuj.Saxena">Ambuj Saxena</a> (<a  title="User talk:Ambuj.Saxena">talk</a>) 12:34, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<h3><a href="/wiki/Jaws_%28film%29.html" title="Jaws (film)">Jaws (film)</a></h3>
<p><i>Self-nomination</i>-I've been working on this article for about two months now, after I stumbled onto it in <a  class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jaws_%28film%29&amp;oldid=66207514" rel="nofollow">this version</a>, and I think it fulfills all the FA criteria. I've added over 20 references and three entire sections completely written by me, as well as heavily editing the rest of the article. It has two peer reviews, one started during its GA Nomination <a  class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Peer_review/Jaws_%28film%29&amp;oldid=70765585" rel="nofollow">here</a>, and another one before I put it up for FAC <a  class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Peer_review/Jaws_%28film%29" rel="nofollow">here</a>.

<li><b>Comment</b> The only thing left to do, IMO, would be to merge the differences with the novel and music sections with the production section, and divide the production section with subheaders- writing (where the Differences section would go), special effects, casting and music. <a  class="new" title="User:CanadianCaesar">CanadianCaesar</a> <small><a  title="User talk:CanadianCaesar">Et tu, Brute?</a></small> 06:48, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks for your comments, but I think John Williams's music is so well-known that it deserves its own section. I have some critical review in there as well, and that would seem out of place in the Production section. I'm not sure differences from the novel would fit in there either. As for subheadings, both Casting and Special Effects are too short to warrant special subheadings.--<a  title="User:Dark Kubrick">Dark Kubrick</a> 10:30, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> I would greatly expand the critical response section, with emphasis on how then-contemporary reviewers reacted to it. This section seems really skimpy for such an important and popular title. The film did receive some positive reviews at the time of its release, but as far as I know the only prominent critic who recognized it as being a great film was <a href="/wiki/Pauline_Kael.html" title="Pauline Kael">Pauline Kael</a>. I would recommend that some quotes from her enthusiastic critique be included. Also, I don't think <a href="/wiki/Vincent_Canby.html" title="Vincent Canby">Vincent Canby</a> was the only notable critic who disliked the film; some other negative responses probably should be included.<a  title="User:Hal Raglan">Hal Raglan</a> 14:02, 31 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I have an extract from a Kael review printed from Cinemania '05. It says "for a more extended discussion, see Pauline Kael's book <i>When the Lights Go Down</i>. <a  title="User:The JPS"><font color="purple">The <b>JP</b>S</font></a><sup><a  title="User talk:The JPS"><b><font color="purple"><b>talk</b> to me</font></b></a></sup> 17:42, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks for the Kael quote and reference. Unfortunately, that book isn't available on Google Books or any local libraries, so I can't get at it. I've tried searching for negative reviews, but this film is just so good that Canby was the only one who panned it. Any ideas?--<a  title="User:Dark Kubrick">Dark Kubrick</a> 18:20, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Later today, I can look up the Kael review and try to provide some quotes in the article. I just did a quick look at the usual mega-review places -- MRQE, DVD Beaver, Rotten Tomatoes, imdb --and found only two 1975-era reviews (Canby and Ebert). The rest were either blogs or recent online fan/review sites (hundreds of those). It's times like this that you realize how poor of a resource the internet can sometimes be. I remember that either Newsweek or Time gave the film a two paragraph review that, while positive, simply described/dismissed the movie as an "efficient scare machine". Only Kael seemed to really recognize how terrific of a movie it was (in fact, it was her review that convinced me to see the film). And it did receive some pans (I think John Simon hated it), but 31 years later access to such print reviews is limited to those people within distance of large city libraries. I'll do some quick research at home tonight and see what I can find.<a  title="User:Hal Raglan">Hal Raglan</a> 19:56, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thank you very much for your efforts. I too find it frustrating that information that far back is unavailable on the web. Google Books and all my local libraries don't have much either. If you're concerned about positive reviews, I wouldn't bother, as I bet I could easily find several critics of that period who recognize it as a great movie. It's the negative POV I'm having trouble representing, so any help in that area would be greatly appreciated.--<a  title="User:Dark Kubrick">Dark Kubrick</a> 20:08, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hey, I found a negative review, from one of the more prominent critics at that time, Charles Champlin (Los Angeles Times):"The first and crucial thing to say about the movie Universal has made from Peter Benchley's bestseller "Jaws" ... is that the PG rating is grievously wrong and misleading. The studio has rightly added its own cautionary notices in the ads, and the fact is that "Jaws" is too gruesome for children, and likely to turn the stomach of the impressionable at any age. While I have no doubt that "Jaws" will make a bloody fortune for Universal and producers Richard Zanuck and David Brown, it is a coarse-grained and exploitive work which depends on excess for its impact. Ashore it is a bore, awkwardly staged and lumpily written." Here's the source: <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/cl-ca-125reviews21may21,0,5582323.htmlstory" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> With Ebert's and Kael's positive responses alongside Canby's and Champlin's negative comments, I think that's probably enough to show a sampling of the critical reactions the movie initially received.<a  title="User:Hal Raglan">Hal Raglan</a> 20:23, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>My 1997 copy of Halliwell's has a quote from someone called William S. Pecter: "A mind-numbing repast for sense-sated gluttons. Shark stew for the stupefied." I've no idea who Pecter is, or where he was writing -- but he's probably established enough to be cited by Halliwell's, and they're safe enough to be referenced? <a  title="User:The JPS"><font color="purple">The <b>JP</b>S</font></a><sup><a  title="User talk:The JPS"><b><font color="purple"><b>talk</b> to me</font></b></a></sup> 20:27, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Not sure we can do anything better. What do you suggest? The locator map, implemented with the {{<a  title="Template:Infobox protected area">Infobox_protected_area</a>}}, uses <a  title="Image:Locator Dot.gif">Image:Locator_Dot.gif</a> and the background map, <a  title="Image:Canadian National Parks Location.png">Image:Canadian National Parks Location.png</a>. This map is used for all Canadian National Parks, and for consistency any change would need to apply to all Canadian National Parks.
<ol>
<li>We could switch to a plain map with only province boundaries and no parks. See <a href="/wiki/Glacier_National_Park_%28US%29.html" title="Glacier National Park (US)">Glacier National Park (US)</a> for comparison, which uses a plain map with state boundaries.</li>
<li>We could keep the parks on the map. Though, maybe the green colour could be adjusted to make them less prominent?</li>
<li>Much more complicated to implement, but we could change the dot symbol to something else, adjust its colour, or size. Though, this would break from consistency with dot locator maps across Wikipedia. This would also require a separate Infobox for just Canadian parks, and this new symbol/size/colour would apply across all Canadian parks.</li>
<li>Get rid of the dot locator map, and come up with something entirely different. But, would loose consistency across park articles.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>Which of these options would you suggest, or do you have some other suggestions. My preference would be to keep the map with the parks, as it helps to show Banff in relation to the location and size of other parks. Yes, some other parks happen to be much larger and thus more "prominent". But, I'm open to suggestions and other ideas. --<a  title="User:AudeVivere">Aude</a> <small>(<a  title="User talk:AudeVivere">talk</a> <a  title="User:AudeVivere/Contributions">contribs</a>)</small> 02:50, 3 September 2006 (UTC)

<p>Having long had a soft spot for the article, I've revisited it and considerably expanded it with extensive referencing using contemporary and modern sources. The revised article now explains the history of crushing by elephant from Roman times through to 19th century India and Indochina. It describes various methods used and provides eyewitness descriptions of crushings along with an explanation of the social context of this rather unpleasant method of execution. It even has two pictures, one of which I managed to obtain from an original copy of a <a href="/wiki/1681.html" title="1681">1681</a> book.</p>
<p>I believe that it meets both the <a  title="WP:GOOD">Good Article</a> and Featured Article criteria, but in view of its length I'm submitting it to FAC for consideration.

<ul>
<li>The chronology is slightly confused, with the article being organised into 'Ancient times and Middle Ages' and 'Modern period'. But the first paragraph of the India section in the Modern Period covers the Ancient period! Overall the organisation between chronological presentation and geographical presentation could be improved. Maybe by summarising chronologically before going into detail for each region?
<dl>
<dd>I've addressed this by taking a different tack: arranging it geographically from west to east (starting with the western empires, as that's where we have the oldest records, followed by west Asia, south Asia and south-east Asia). -- <a  title="User:ChrisO">ChrisO</a> 21:25, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>In general, more precise dating and location details for each example would be nice. Links to other articles require people to go there to find out the dates of the historical period linked. If you are organising by date, put the date details in this article (eg. say what period <a href="/wiki/Perdiccas.html" title="Perdiccas">Perdiccas</a> is from). Ditto for the geographical stuff (eg. say where <a href="/wiki/Perdiccas.html" title="Perdiccas">Perdiccas</a> was carrying out his executions - hint, it was not in Macedon!).
<dl>
<dd>No, it was Babylon! I've added these details now. -- <a  title="User:ChrisO">ChrisO</a> 21:25, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>Different elephant species and wild vs domesticated. You should make clear that Hannibal's elephants were a dwarf variety from Africa and the Perdiccas ones were probably from India. Were Ptolemy IV's elephants African or Indian? Ditto for all the examples you give - which species of elephant? Also, you could try and say something about whether sub-Saharan African elephants were ever used this way (I'd speculate probably not, because it was the Asian elephants that were domesticated, and the sub-Saharan African elephants remain wild to this day, being (I think) larger and less easy to domesticate. ie. say something about wild vs domesticated elephants (or rather, say more than you say at the moment).
<dl>
<dd>I've added a paragraph on this subject. -- <a  title="User:ChrisO">ChrisO</a> 21:25, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>A point of chronology. You seem to have organised the "Ancient times and Middle Ages" in chronological order, but you have mentioned <a href="/wiki/Perdiccas.html" title="Perdiccas">Perdiccas</a> (died 320 BC) <i>after</i> <a href="/wiki/Ptolemy_IV_Philopator.html" title="Ptolemy IV Philopator">Ptolemy IV Philopator</a> (reigned from around 220 BC).
<dl>
<dd>I've changed the approach a bit. Perdiccas and Paulus both used elephants to discipline troops; Ptolemy IV allegedly used them to carry out civil executions (much closer to the uses described in the rest of the article). I've therefore grouped these accounts by category (military followed by civil). -- <a  title="User:ChrisO">ChrisO</a> 21:25, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>A point of fact. You say that <a href="/wiki/Perdiccas.html" title="Perdiccas">Perdiccas</a> "became regent of Macedon on the death of Alexander the Great" - in fact, you should really say more than this. Read <a href="/wiki/Perdiccas.html" title="Perdiccas">Perdiccas</a> and <a href="/wiki/Partition_of_Babylon.html" title="Partition of Babylon">Partition of Babylon</a> for details. I think you need to say that Perdiccas was regent of the Macedonian <i>empire</i>, and not just the kingdom, and similarly make clear that this probably all took place in <a href="/wiki/Babylon.html" title="Babylon">Babylon</a>, and that the use of elephants was probably inspired by the campaigns in India. Though you will need to find sources for all this - I am speculating on some points here.
<dl>
<dd>I found an account by <a href="/wiki/Quintus_Curtius_Rufus.html" title="Quintus Curtius Rufus">Quintus Curtius Rufus</a> which does indeed say that it took place in Babylon - it's now quoted in the article. I've clarified the point about Perdiccas' status. -- <a  title="User:ChrisO">ChrisO</a> 21:25, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>General point of facts - you might want to click on all the links in the article and check that your article is consistent with other Wikipedia articles. When I was checking the regnal dates for <a href="/wiki/Ptolemy_IV_Philopator.html" title="Ptolemy IV Philopator">Ptolemy IV Philopator</a>, I discovered that his article says 221-224 BC (different to your dates). I seem to recall that this is a fairly common problem with the Egyptian Ptolemies, with two different regnal numbering systems being used and some confusion over the regnal dates. Anyway, it is worth clicking on <i>every</i> link and checking that there are no inconsistencies like this.
<dl>
<dd>Yeah, I've seen many different dates for the Ptolemies... anyway, it's corrected now. -- <a  title="User:ChrisO">ChrisO</a> 21:25, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>Categories. The article is not in enough categories. It should be in at least one "historical" category. I would suggest <a  title="Category:History by topic">Category:History by topic</a> or one or more of the subcategories of that category.
<dl>
<dd>I've added several regional categories plus <a  title="Category:Legal history">Category:Legal history</a> - if we have <a href="/wiki/Hanging%2C_drawing_and_quartering.html" title="Hanging, drawing and quartering">hanging, drawing and quartering</a> in there, there's definitely room for crushing by elephants! -- <a  title="User:ChrisO">ChrisO</a> 21:25, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>: "<i>such fatalities <b>tend to be</b> the result of wild elephants attacking humans rather than tame elephants being used by humans to kill other humans.</i>" (emphasis mine) So does the use of "tend to be" mean that there <i>have</i> indeed been a few exceptions where, in recent years, humans have intentionally set elephants on other humans?

</li>
<li>This article seems to go beyond the scope of its title. I would assume that if one were to be killed by an elephant it would probably be by crushing, but I have to ask — is the sentence from my previous point referring to crushing specifically or death by elephant in general? (And how often is "not uncommon"?) Another example: <i>It then seizes him with its lip, casts him aloft and slays him.</i> from the account of Petachiah does not mention crushing at all. The account from Tennet: <i>...placing his foot on the prostrate victim, plucked off his limbs in succession by a sudden movement of his trunk.</i> is specifically not crushing. I wonder if Execution by elephant (currently a redirect to this article) would be a more appropriate title.
<dl>
<dd>From the various accounts I found, it does seem that crushing was the most widely used method (which is what you would expect, given that it wouldn't require much training) and the other methods were less common. -- <a  title="User:ChrisO">ChrisO</a> 21:25, 5 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I would suggest renaming this page "Death by elephant", since it seems to cover all forms of death by elephant, whether crushing, goring, or otherwise. <b><a  title="User:Pagrashtak"><font color="#8855DD">Pagra</font></a><a  title="User talk:Pagrashtak"><font color="#6666AA">shtak</font></a></b> 19:42, 6 September 2006 (UTC)

<h3><a href="/wiki/Seabird.html" title="Seabird">Seabird</a></h3>
<p><i>Self nom</i>. Massive subject, but all the important points about seabird biology have been dealt with. No doubt some breakout articles will appear in the future (seabird colonies already has). This article is the result of months of work (interspersed with months of looking at it hating it), but I finally think it is ready now. It's been to two peer reviews (<a  title="Wikipedia:Peer review/Seabird/Archive1">the first</a> and <a  title="Wikipedia:Peer review/Seabird">the second</a>), the points there having been addressed. To preempt one possible comment, to be a seabird is a niche, not a clade; many disparate families are seabirds. For this reason the article deals with trends associated with seabirds, rather than numerous absolute statements about seabirds (though there are plenty of cited examples of those trends). Anyway, I hope you can support. <a  title="User:Sabine's Sunbird">Sabine's Sunbird</a> <a  title="User talk:Sabine's Sunbird">talk</a> 05:48, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> Excellent work, but I find the article to be undercited. I won't object on that basis, as I believe this deficiency can be easily corrected. As a random example of a section that should be cited: "Seabirds, by virtue of living in a geologically depositional environment (that is, in the sea where sediments are readily laid down), are well represented in the fossil record. They are first known to occur in the Cretaceous era, the earliest being the Hesperornithiformes, like Hesperornis regalis, a flightless loon-like seabird that dove in a similar fashion to loons and cormorants (using its feet to move underwater) but had a beak filled with sharp teeth." <a  title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy</a> 15:47, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Many highly generalised statements are hard to cite from primary sources (journals)- they all either come from Schreiber &amp; Burger,(2001) or Gaston 2004, which are review works that pull everything together and synthesise it.

<li><b>Comment</b> I think the role in culture section needs some work. Regarding the opening sentence, "study" has nothing to do with what's being discussed here. Use of the phrase "popular consciousness" is quite strange for this subject. It says gulls and albatrosses are most 'popular', then goes on to discuss pelicans in the next sentence, <i>then</i> discusses albatrosses, <i>then</i> skips a line and discusses gulls in a new paragraph - poor organization. "It is widely considered unlucky to harm them" - by whom? I don't believe this, and my intuition tells me that I'm not in the minority. Saying that "'sailors believed this or that' is an urban legend" is awkward. Using quotes from a Disney movie to explain something is highly informal. Lord of the Rings example is too detailed. Personally, I'd just delete the section. It discusses isolated things relating to specific types of seabirds, not things common to seabirds in general. The article wouldn't lose much without it. <a  title="User:Punctured Bicycle">Punctured Bicycle</a> 13:52, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Deleteing the section would be counterprodutive, it would invite <a  title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Laundromat">laundry lists</a> namechecking every seabird (see below). I've argued for keeping the LOTR section long in the peer review - I said <i>Having an explanation of how birds fit into popular culture, rather than simply stating they do with an example, is more rewarding, and it leaves less room for every fanboy to come and list how their fad has a seabird in it. I'd rather have one example, explained well, than a list namechecking every reference.</i> As for quoting Disney I don't consider it informal - you'd be hard pressed to find a more 'popular' culture or 'mass' media. The storm petrel bit did use the past tense, I've tried to make it clearer it was refering to sailors considering it unlucky. I've re-organised per your comments and cited some more stuff. <a  title="User:Sabine's Sunbird">Sabine's Sunbird</a> <a  title="User talk:Sabine's Sunbird">talk</a> 16:57, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Why is there no photograph of what he looks like now? The most recent one looks like it's a couple of decades old (though the photograph itself was taken in 2006). There should be plenty of available images of an important world leader like him, no? -<a  title="User:Silence">Silence</a> 13:27, 14 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Response</b> Actually no. The Thai government is very protective of the King's public image. For example, the Thai currency, stamps, etc still uses images that are probably 40-50 years old. Finding a modern image that is not copyrighted and suitable for wikipedia use is very difficult, but I shall keep looking for one. All the recent ones I've found in the past are from news agencies and copyrighted. <a  title="User:Rlevse">Rlevse</a> 13:35, 14 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I think that a fair-use image would be acceptable here. Although we should avoid fair use whenever possible, in some cases it is necessary, even in Featured Articles, to make use of them when something is important to depict and an appropriate free-use image is unavailable. For example, if we didn't have any free-use images of George W. Bush from the last few years, it would be appropriate to use a fair-use one because of his importance as a public figure; the greater time-difference for Bhumibol (the most recent depiction of him we have, at the top of the page, looks at least 30 years old, considering that he's about 80 years old now) renders it even more important. Besides, information (both textual and pictorial) that is harder to come by is that much more important to include; people come here to learn things they can't find out from more conventional print sources. -<a  title="User:Silence">Silence</a> 14:51, 14 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>A news agency photo is not a 'publicity photograph'. A publicity photograph is one issued by a body to publicise themselves, an event, etc. This is completely different.

<li><b>Response</b> Good news, guys and gals. <a  title="User:Maharaj Devraj">Devraj Rangsit</a> has generously scanned and GFDL'ed <a  class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Mahidols-1938.jpg#file" rel="nofollow">Mahidols-1938.jpg</a>, a photograph taken in 1938 showing King Ananda Mahidol, Prince Bhumibol, and there grandmother <a href="/wiki/Savang_Vadhana.html" title="Savang Vadhana">Savang Vadhana</a>. The photograph was taken by Prince Rangsit Prayoonsak, uncle of the Kings and an ancestor of Devraj Rangsit. The photograph was published in the book First Trip Abroad (Priyananda Rangsit, ed.) along with many others of great historical value. The photo is a welcome contribution to Wikipedia and definitely should be used in the article.

<li><b>Comment</b>. I don't know what the manual of style says, but should the article mention by its name <i>Bhumibol</i> or using the title <i>King Bhumibol</i>? <a  title="User:Cedar-Guardian">CG</a> 13:47, 15 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Response</b> Per MOS as I read it and seeing other articles, King does not go in the title and should not open the article, but it <i>may</i> be discussed in the article. Ex, in the article on Elizabeth II, it refers to her as Elizabeth in the text and in George VI it refers to him as George VI in the body. It also says there is much controversy on this.

<li><b>Comment</b> - from Khompat. I disagree in any cases to put so many details about Thai politics on this article. I think, the authors (who contributed this article) should not even talk much in this article about him as a politician, but rather as a person. Politics can be discussed in more details in the other articles. On the other hand something should be mentioned anywayin order to enable links to other articles, so that people can easily find them.</li>
</ul>

<dd>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> I strongly disagree. The King has made critical interventions in Thai politics over the decades, and such interventions have had a major impact on both Thailand's political development as well as how the King is perceived by the Thai people. Even his non-political activities (ceremonies, charity, rural tours) have been the result of political relationships. For instance, he was only allowed a handful of rural tours during his difficult relationship with dictator <a href="/wiki/Plaek_Pibulsonggram.html" title="Plaek Pibulsonggram">Plaek Pibulsonggram</a>, but when the much more accomodating <a href="/wiki/Sarit_Dhanarajata.html" title="Sarit Dhanarajata">Sarit Dhanarajata</a> seized power, his rural tours increased many-fold; the rural tours where critical in increasing his visibility to the Thai people and are a fundamental part of his mythos. To have an article on King Bhumibol without discussing his role in politics would turn it into a fantasy-land hagiography. As to the level of political detail that is appropriate for the main biographical article, this has been debated in the Discussion page. The current consensus seems to be that the current amount of detail is good, although further additions about specific issues might be useful - however, caution should be taken not to significantly increase the size of the article. <a  title="User:Patiwat">Patiwat</a> 21:33, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - from Khompat. I think, this article is not so good to some respects because some contents are not true, therefore I could not consider this is the nice biography. Moreover, the references used here are unconvincing, for example "The King Never Smiles". The authors who contributed this article are unknown. They all hided themself. So, this fact already looks suspicious to me. I think, someone here tried to write something in a wrong and disrespect way. I suggest that the author must be only a reliable and reachable person, not just like a gangster. This is very important point because in the case if I have doubt, I can contact him or her easily. <small>—The preceding <a  title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a  title="User:Khompat">Khompat</a> (<a  title="User talk:Khompat">talk</a> • <a  title="Special:Contributions/Khompat">contribs</a>) .</small>

<li><b>Comment</b>. If any of my edits have seemed gangsterly, I do apologize, although I would appreciate some specificity in any accusations. As for reliability and reachability, by definition, all registered Wikipedia users are reachable on their <a  class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Patiwat" rel="nofollow">Talk pages</a>. Regarding editor reliability, the article has lately been under a barrage of vandalism, and it might be wise to examine the edit record of individual editors to see whether they have a good record of constructive edits. The problems of vandalism and sockpuppetry wont go away, but vigilance can help reduce it. As for "The King Never Smiles", I have tried to use this reference as little as possible, because editors based in Thailand will find it difficult to verify the source (the book has been banned - however, Amazon.com will still ship it). Because of that, care should be taken to corraborate it with facts from other sources, preferably, those available in Thailand. Specific concerns about accuracy of sources would better be discussed in the article discussion page, not here. <a  title="User:Patiwat">Patiwat</a> 19:32, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>There seem to be enormous edit version since the falling of the current caretake government popularity "Thaksin Shinawatra". By my rough estimate, over 500+ versions since the December 2005 version. When compare with the December 2005 version, the current version seems to be very much polically motivated. The most frequent contributor is user name'Patiwat' which makes me wondering whether Patiwat is under the falling regime payroll or try to insert some of his political idea to defame the King? Giving the fact that the last Thai election is only one party election which was totally undemocratic way and it seems to bethe same opinion with the King that the last Thai election was unjustified and need to be invalid. I guess it's true that the King has a lot of influence in Thai politics. However, in the past long record, this special influence has saved Thai fragile democracy and slowly nurture the Thai democracy system. When I checked the info on the user 'Patiwat' the most frequent contributor to this article (from Dec 2005 - current), Patiwat's statements stated that "No, I don't love Thaksin. In fact, I have more valid reasons for hating him than most Thai people. But I love democracy more than I hate Thaksin. And I have nothing but scorn for an elite that belittles the plight of the poor. I'd rather have a corrupt democracy over an efficient aristocracy any day." I think for the sake of the validity of Wikepedia, I'd appreciate it very much if the user'Patiwat' could state his motive to edit this particular article daily. Plus, are ther any financial support for the current caretaker government of doing so. I could imagine that one would do daily edit, multiple times a day without paid. This really make you wonder how bias is this current version of this article from political motive? And is Wikepedia the right venue for anyone to take over and express their own polical view point? Why not write your own blog instead. Thanks, Jim Thompson (ex-expat)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> - from Khompat. I am sorry to say that I would like to leave my comment here. To make any discussion with all of you is useless and wasting of my time. Either to post or to contribute this kind of article is also beyound my ability. You all will try to change it back as you wish anyway. This is disadvantage of free website. I do not want to waste my time for that. I should rather make a comment or remark. I think, the readers have their own judgment, so I am sure that most of Thai people would not believe this article much anyway. We all know the truth.</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - from Khompat. One more comment from me. I think, the editors here did not understand my point completely. My concern is that here in this article contained too much politic thing. I prefere that the editors make a link for the other topics, for instance "Crisis 2005-2006 in Thailand" and so on. Because this is supposed to be a biography, so it should contain only the general aspects about King's life. Why don't editors just translate from the article in this Wikipedia in the topic of "พระบาทสมเด็จพระปรมินทรมหาภูมิพลอดุลยเดช" (Thai version of King Bhumibol Adulyadej).
<ul>
<li>Khompat, please don't be discouraged. Wikipedia <i>welcomes</i> people of diverse perspectives, as long as they provide citations for their contributions, strive for the representation of all points of view, and are respectful of others.</li>
<li>Khompat, you have noted yourself that "<i>the King has a lot of influence in Thai politics</i>" and that "<i>this special influence has saved Thai fragile democracy and slowly nurture the Thai democracy system.</i>" Given your views, how can you reasonably expect that the article not discuss his role in politics?</li>
<li>I do not think this article should strive to be an enlish translation of the <a  class="external text" title="http://th.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E0%B8%9E%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%B0%E0%B8%9A%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%97%E0%B8%AA%E0%B8%A1%E0%B9%80%E0%B8%94%E0%B9%87%E0%B8%88%E0%B8%9E%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%B0%E0%B8%9B%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%A1%E0%B8%B4%E0%B8%99%E0%B8%97%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%A1%E0%B8%AB%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%A0%E0%B8%B9%E0%B8%A1%E0%B8%B4%E0%B8%9E%E0%B8%A5%E0%B8%AD%E0%B8%94%E0%B8%B8%E0%B8%A5%E0%B8%A2%E0%B9%80%E0%B8%94%E0%B8%8A" rel="nofollow">Thai Wikipedia article</a>.

The accuracy of the article can not be validated. In addition, the images on that article are not sourced and are presumably copyrighted images that are being used in the article without permission. Third, the article does not contain any mention of his private life and hobbies, his future succession, his royal prerogatives and how he has used them, nor his role in politics. In summary, the Thai language article could really use improvement as a biographical article, and should not be compared against the article in the English language wikipedia.

<li><b>Comment</b> - from Khompat. I could only say that I have many objections to this article as mentioned above. You do your duty to edit this. I also do my duty to comment. That's all - I would like to say. One more thing, I agree that the language written here is very good. For this I have no doubt because you used some books as your references which the authors are supposed to be English host. Maybe I should stay abroad in one country for 10 years, then I will write the book to criticize that country by myself or my own opinion. Later, someone in that country will appreciate my work untill he could copy it and use it as reference. Well, anyway I have a doubt that it is a good idea to do so.</li>

<p>This article just doesn't seem right. Why is it being edited on such a regular basis; is King Bhumibol of Thailand that much of a motivation for the wikipedian editors involved? I would love to see these people working on HM Queen Elizabeth of the UK or perhaps the Sultan of Brunei as well. Also, I notice that this particular encyclopedic entry contains to many irrelavant information as well as non-subjective information--why go into so much details about those "incidents" or particular issues of interest. The entry also features tidbits of informations gathered from here and there for no apparent reasons. I have read the exact article on Encarta 2006 DVD Encyclopedia and it reads much better, and does not contains the non-subjective information like here. I think that this particular entry is quite unreliable, unlike that of Encarta which was written by college professors.<small>—The preceding <a  title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a  class="new" title="User:125.24.240.219">125.24.240.219</a> (<a  class="new" title="User talk:125.24.240.219">talk</a> • <a  title="Special:Contributions/125.24.240.219">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

<li><s>Several short paragraphs. These should be merged or expanded if possible.</s></li>
<li>It would be good if you used the <a  title="Template:Cite web">Cite web</a>, <a  title="Template:Cite book">Cite book</a> etc templates for your inline citations where possible, but especially for the inlines with no or poor descriptions (ie. endnotes 28, 29, 34, 35, 39 and 42).</li>
<li><s>Can the specifications be moved into some sort of table instead of a straight list? I found it confusing to try and read the list as it is.</s></li>
<li>This is not really a problem, but a few people have been mentioning the use of the svg format instead of png, jpg and especially gif for diagrams. I think this would be especially useful for this diagram, since it should probably be represented accurately no matter how the image is resized.</li>

<dd>Darkliight, thanks very much for your comments! I'll address them one by one, to make it easier.
<ul>
<li>I believe the short paragraphs have been remedied. I've also done some major overhauling of the article's structure in any case, especially regarding ordering of sections and hierarchy.</li>
<li>I've corrected those specific citations (though the numbers probably have changed with editing), although I've simply written them out instead of using the template. I just feel they're too cumbersome; however, if this is something that <i>must</i> be implemented as template rather than text, I'll slog through rewriting all the citations.</li>
<li>I'm not certain that the specifications can be turned into a table, merely because the different formats mainly have different concepts they are defining. The <b>35 mm spherical</b>, for example, contains a slew of TV specs that don't exist for the other format, and vice versa. But if someone has a way of implementing a table effectively, I'm certainly open to try it. If the specifications are confusing, maybe you could clarify which ones and why? That probably will help towards elucidating the matter.</li>
<li>I'll ask the image editors of that particular diagram about making an SVG format; however, as I'm not a graphics guy, I can't guarantee any progress there.</li>
<li>Image resized.</li>
<li>More images added. Let me know if you think more are needed, or if the ones added are inadequate.</li>

<dd>Hello again Girolamo Savonarola, thanks for addressing the concerns.
<ul>
<li>I still think you should use the templates for your cites, but I won't object if you don't. There are still some issues with some of the cites though, in particular #10 (it's description is really lacking&#160;:)) and #32 is just a URL.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>I believe that was mainly oversight from the restructuring. I've corrected the matter. Thank you also for your lenience on the template matter - if the content is displayed more or less identically with either method, and the template is designed to make things "easier", then I'd prefer to simply do it by hand, as I don't believe that the template is easier (at least for me). That's my simple rationale, but if there is a flaw in it, let me know.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>I think one of the big advantages of templates is that if, for whatever reason, the display style is changed, then a single change to the template will bring every article that uses the template into line. Another plus is that is encourages other users, especially newer ones that aren't sure how how to go about adding a reference, to use them instead of just posting an external link or the like. Whenever I add references to an article, I can almost always just copy and paste a previous cite template, change the required parameters and hit submit without worrying about style. A third advantage, is that it makes it easy for bots to check reference URL's, ISBN's etc. These reasons are just off the top of my head so there are surely other reasons. <a  title="User:Darkliight">darkliight</a><sup><a  title="User talk:Darkliight">[πalk]</a></sup> 04:32, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><s>Throughout the article, inches and mm are used in most cases, but they should follow a similar format. For example, in the intro we have "<i>The photographic film is cut into strips 1 3/8 inches or 35 mm wide</i>", the Super 35 section where we have "<i>an overall negative area of 240 mm<sup>2</sup> (9.45"<sup>2</sup>), only a mere 9 mm<sup>2</sup> (.35"<sup>2</sup>) less than the 1.85:1 crop</i>", and then later on we just have "<i>Known as "Kodak Standard" (KS), they are 0.078" high by 0.11" wide</i>". I'd prefer measurements to be set out like "<i>The photographic film is cut into strips 35 mm (1 3/8 inches) wide</i>" - I've given precedence to the metric measurement for a few reasons, but mostly because the articles title is a metric measurement. " can be supplemented for inches later on ofcourse.</s></li>

<dd>
<ul>
<li>Ah, welcome to the wonderfully odd world of film standards!&#160;:) The format is labelled in metric, however most of its standards were created by Americans in "standard" units, and thus the metric numbers are conversions in those cases and are identified as such. Furthermore, in my research today I've discovered that despite the name, the format is actually precisely 1 3/8 inches wide, due to historical reasons - now clarified in a footnote. However, apparently the most strictly accurate name for the format in millimeters would be 34.8 mm! I have, however, added metric equivalents for the omitted measurements in the perforations section. But bear in mind that they are standardized to inches by Eastman Kodak, not millimeters, hence the inch measurements are given primacy. In the case of accepted names for formats, such as 8 mm and 16 mm, I have left no conversion, as these are the common names for the gauges rather then measurements, per se.</li>

<li>I've added a clearer image of the digital formats as well now. However, I'm not certain that a projection picture could easily show this - there are several you might want to take a look at on the <a href="/wiki/Movie_projector.html" title="Movie projector">movie projector</a> page.

<li>My concern was that complete novices to the topic of film (students doing an assignment for example) would be able to see <i>why</i> we put the images onto film. I know it must seem very obvious to everyone here, and I agree with you that an explanation is for another article, but if a school kid comes home from watching a movie and gets curious and they stumble accross this article, I think it would be interesting to actually see the film in use in a projector and the result on a screen - I think even a diagram would suffice for this if you come accross one. Ofcourse, that was just an idea and I'm not going to demand it, so consider it struck. <a  title="User:Darkliight">darkliight</a><sup><a  title="User talk:Darkliight">[πalk]</a></sup> 04:32, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Support</b>. I whole-heartedly support this nomination. It's well referenced, and I don't see any major things, but there are <strike>two minor things</strike> one minor thing that I thought I'd mention. <strike>First of all, if I understand it correctly, in the 1950s movie studios experimented with 3D, Smell-o-Vision, and all sorts of other things, before coming up with widescreen. In addition, there was a lot of competition among the studios to create the dominant widescreen format (i.e. WarnerScope, CineMiracle, etc.) I believe this is important to mention, however briefly, in this article.</strike> Number two: Most studio films are shot with a DI these days, you might want to mention that.

<li><b>Comment</b> Changing the title to something like "35 mm cinema film" would clarify that, and make the introductory remark unnecessary. Hundreds of millions of people have used 35 mm film cameras and call the film "35 mm film" whereas they have not used 35 mm cinema cameras and aren't commonly aware of the film that is used for the movies they watch. So, the title seems to attract the wrong reader. I would find it easier to support the article under a more precise title. <a  title="User:Fg2">Fg2</a> 01:26, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>I'm not certain I necessarily agree with that assertion, especially with 35 mm stills film already having had severe losses to the digital crowd. Furthermore, it is a <i>very</i> common film terminology term just as likely to be widely known by hundreds of millions of moviegoers, and unfortunately doesn't seem to have another commonly used term, as 35 mm stills/135 film does. Is there a problem with having a "see this article for this term" sign at the top? Plenty of other articles do, including <a href="/wiki/Film.html" title="Film">film</a>, which no doubt has different meanings to the stills crowd as well as the scientific community. <a  title="User:Girolamo Savonarola">Girolamo Savonarola</a> 21:31, 19 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Additionally, the histories of both <a href="/wiki/35_mm_film.html" title="35 mm film">35 mm film</a> and <a href="/wiki/135_film.html" title="135 film">135 film</a> show that they were split like so from their inception(s). The decision to split them like so is even noted in <a  title="Talk:35 mm film">Talk:35 mm film</a>, where it is noted that most readers will be equally split between which two they'd want to see, so the one with the more precise and equivalent term (135 film) is given a toplink, while the other (for movies) will remain the primary topic of the article. The talk pages of these articles also give no indication of any users wishing to change this at any time in the past 3.5 years since these articles began to co-exist. My predominant feeling is to leave it be, unless there is a sizable objection to the current situation. <a  title="User:Girolamo Savonarola">Girolamo Savonarola</a> 21:46, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h3><a href="/wiki/Al-Kateb_v_Godwin.html" title="Al-Kateb v Godwin">Al-Kateb v Godwin</a></h3>
<p>This is an important recent Australian court case which has both popular significance (a controversial decision on a migration matter, a hot-button topic in Australian politics in recent years) and legal significance (as the leading case on executive detention, that is detention imposed by the executive rather than judicial government).</p>
<p>In my humble opinion as the article's main contributor, it is comprehensive (including a treatment of the background and consequences) and covers all aspects of the case in a way that I hope is understandable to those with and without specialist legal knowledge. It is referenced throughout, and incorporates a variety of sources. The article has already been through <a  title="Wikipedia:Peer review/Al-Kateb v Godwin">a peer review</a>, where it received positive feedback leading to several improvements.</p>
<p>It is perhaps lacking an image, although I am not aware of any existing photographs of the person at the centre of the case. --<a  title="User:Thebainer">bainer</a> (<a  title="User talk:Thebainer">talk</a>) 15:48, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Object</b> - Comprehensive and well written. However, the text is overtly sympathetic <i>against</i> the court ruling. I consider certain sections and sub-sections towards the end of the article to border on commentary; this can be easily seen in the "tragic" and Bill of Rights discussion, and the partisan quotes used: "saving Australia from boat people counts for more than Al-Kateb's raw liberty." and "It's like a death punishment." are but two examples. I will be changing my vote to an object if my qualms are not attended to. <a  title="User:Beneaththelandslide">michael</a> <sup><a  title="User talk:Beneaththelandslide">talk</a></sup> 17:21, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'm certainly open to including more points of view about the case in the article. However, I think the inclusion of these points of view is justified: the "death punishment" description was made by the subject of the case himself, and I think that inlcuding the parties' response to the case is appropriate (the Government didn't, as far as I am aware, express any strong views on the case after it was decided, rather there had been a change in the ministry and the new minister took a different approach, as set out in the article). The discussion about the case and a bill of rights were made by one of the judges who decided the case, and I would suggest that any comments made by judges about their cases are worthy of inclusion. Finally, in terms of media commentary, there were few (if any) commentators who came out in support of the decision, although I'll try to find some. That said, there's no discussion of the academic response to the case, which generally takes the line that the decision was strictly legally correct, despite other shortcomings. I shall include some discussion of that point of view. --<a  title="User:Thebainer">bainer</a> (<a  title="User talk:Thebainer">talk</a>) 01:03, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

The Judiciary Act reference is confusing to those who don't know the act, and the relevant sections aren't explained in the linked article - personally I'd delete the reference. Second, I've only read some of the judgements in the case, so how did Callinan J avoid deciding on the constitutionality of the section, given that he was in the majority? Oh, and on the above comments about bias, I don't think it's biased and the 'tragic' comment was made by one of the majority judges (obviously a supporter of the decision) about the circumstances leading to Kateb being a stateless person, not the decision itself. <a  title="User:Psychobabble">Psychobabble</a> 03:33, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>"the oldest publisher of science fiction and fantasy novels still active" - still active where - in the world? Regardless of answer, could this be referenced?</li>
<li>"Further mergers and acquisitions ultimately resulted in Ace becoming a part of Berkley Books, and Ace is now a paperback imprint of Penguin Group (USA)." - I don't know the current status from this sentence. It says "ultimately", which implies there have been no further developments since Berkley; but then it says it is a now with Penguin.</li>
<li>"The editorial team at Ace is the same team that edits the Roc imprint, although the two [imprints] maintain a separate identity." suggest the addition of "imprints" because the sentence reads that one team maintains two identities.</li>
<li>for general readership, suggest expanding "SF" to "science fiction" throughout</li>

<dl>
<dd>Yes, please; that would be very helpful. With regard to the first point you raise, I think the intent (the sentence predates my involvement) is to indicate that it is *now* a specialist sf publisher, and no current specialist sf publisher has been around as long as Ace. One could certainly find sf works that predate 1952 which were published by publishers that still exist, so in that sense the sentence is incorrect. Referencing the intended meaning would be a bit difficult, though I might find the claim asserted in a reference work (and will look). Short of that the claim may have to be removed; in the meantime please copyedit as you see fit. Thanks. <a  title="User:Mike Christie">Mike Christie</a> 04:39, 12 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>One additional comment -- with regard to the sf vs. science fiction question, I agree that a general readership must have the abbreviation explained. I'm concerned that it will seem clunky to repeat "science fiction" at every turn, though; perhaps we could establish the use of the abbreviation early in the article? If we do use it, I have been preferring "sf" to "SF", except in captions/titles; that's the style used in e.g. the Nicholls/Clute "Encyclopaedia of Science Fiction", the most prominent reference work in the field. <a  title="User:Mike Christie">Mike Christie</a> 04:43, 12 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Hi Mike, I have finished my edits to the article. Please review and ensure I haven't changed any meanings or such. I moved a couple of sections around and moved two main headings out of main-heading status. Comments: I take it that collecting is an important aspect of Ace Books; if so I think the article should discuss that aspect more. I didn't know what this sentence meant: "Carr became a freelance editor; both Carr and Wollheim went on to edit separate Year's Best volumes." - best volumes of what, and with what company? Also, "Genres in the 1950s and 1960s" doesn't have any inline references. That might bother someone... <a  title="User:Outriggr">Outriggr</a> 13:55, 13 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I've made a few wording changes; take a look and see what you think. Specific points you raise:
<ul>
<li>Collecting: yes, collectors like the covers, and the doubles format. The titles section is really there only because of the collectors; I doubt it could be justified without that. I've added a little about specialist references -- is more needed?</li>
<li>Year's Best -- this is a reference to the earlier mention of Carr and Wollheim editing a "Year's Best SF" anthology. There have been quite a few of these series in the sf field, and Carr's and Wollheim's versions were quite notable and influential. Wollheim's were (unsurprisingly) published by his own company, DAW; Carr's were published by Ballantine. Do we actually need to mention this at all, now I come to think of it? That sentence predates my involvement in editing the article, and I guess I've never thought about whether it was needed.</li>
<li>Genres in the 50s etc. The data that makes this verifiable is all in the titles listings, which are linked later in the article. Those are in turn verifiable since each book provides the verification of the dates and genre. What's an appropriate way to cite that? I could use a &lt;ref&gt; tag to point to those articles, but on the face of it that would contravene the <a  title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">reliable sources</a> dictum that Wikipedia is not a citable source. What do you think the best way is to do this?</li>

<dd>Works for me. 1) If there is a collecting community it might be interesting to know what makes a book valuable, etc. Fairly minor. 2) Neutral on that. 3) I agree with your point.

<dd>Some other thoughts for you... I feel the lead could use one more summary paragraph. It goes from an intro about the company, to the death of Wyn and Ace's declining status. A middle paragraph could be a summary of the company's glory days, with the first paragraph being introductory, maybe even reiterating the historical interest in Ace today. Also, a "criticism" section seems to be a requirement for today's FA's (unless they're about Pokemon, perhaps). Is there any interesting stuff you could add about criticism of the company at any point in its history, due to its being a "pulp" fiction publisher or such? I would definitely support after those additions (not that I won't support it now). I expect you will encounter some opposition due to the "listiness" of the last sections of the article. Anything you could do to reduce the point-form style would probably help with other supporters. <a  title="User:Outriggr">Outriggr</a> 03:12, 15 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I've rewritten and slightly expanded the lead; take a look and fix as you think fit. I am having a hard time coming up with a criticism section, though. Any such criticism of it as a publishing house would have to be of the form "authors X and Y claim they were cheated by Ace", and I don't know of material like that, though no doubt there is some. I do have that anecdote of Wollheim's about the Ace author who had to pick fruit for a living because Ace didn't pay him, but I don't see how to make a section of it. As for the listiness, I think the best candidate to eliminate as a list would be the serial number section, which could be made into a table, perhaps. Would that be an improvement, though? I don't see what to do about the other lists -- they seem inherently listy to me. Any suggestions on that?

<dd>Thanks for the comments; I've edited the lead -- take another look. I cut six "Ace"s from the lead. I couldn't find a tidy way to say "US company", so I said the company was founded "in New York"; is this good enough? I agree re "in business", but I'm not convinced about "various Ace Science Fiction Specials series" -- if I take out "various" it will sound as if there was only one series, and that's not the case. Given that, do you still think this is redundant?</dd>

<p><b>Support</b>: Great job on the article. I especially found the Tolkien controversy very interesting, since I own the Ballantine edition, and wondered what he meant by that.

<dd>It's cited down below in the main body; I could add the cite, but I <i>think</i> the preferred style is to avoid refs in the lead if they are reffed later. As for the Ballantine edition, do you mean you have the authorized version from the 1960s?

<p>Self-nomination. A core article in biochemistry written as a complete introduction for both general and more specialised readers. Multiple revisions, clarifications and refinements have been added since the last draft of this page was submitted for Featured Article in 2005 <a  class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Featured_article_candidates/Enzyme/Archive_1" rel="nofollow">Archive of previous discussion</a>. <a  title="User:TimVickers">TimVickers</a> 18:43, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>: My first impression is this looks great. I've fixed a few minor things and I'll need a chance to properly read it before supporting, but in the mean time I have two suggestions:
<ul>
<li>See if you can merge those one sentence paragraphs (or expand them if it makes more sense to do that) - especially the ones in the lead, and</li>
<li>See if you can find someone to convert the diagrams (obviously not the ribbon ones) into SVG format.</li>

<li>The sentence "The activities of enzymes are determined by their three-dimensional structure" is overstated - plenty of proteins have nonessential bits of tertiary structure. This would be clearer if the introduction of the active-site concept were moved up one paragraph. I'm not convinced you really even need a discussion of protein synthesis here; it's covered in <a href="/wiki/Protein.html" title="Protein">protein</a>, <a href="/wiki/Protein_biosynthesis.html" title="Protein biosynthesis">protein biosynthesis</a>, <a href="/wiki/Gene_expression.html" title="Gene expression">gene expression</a>, and elsewhere.</li>

<dl>
<dd>I would dispute that "activities are solely determined by structure" unless you're using a very broad definition of "activity" or "structure". What about protonation states, solution conditions (low Mg concentration, high product concentration), etc? Maybe it would be clearer as "<i>specificities</i> are determined by structure"? <a  title="User:Opabinia regalis">Opabinia regalis</a> 04:45, 29 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>A difficult distinction to draw, since properties like pH optima or requirements for cations are also determined by the structure of an enzyme. Indeed, all physical properties of proteins are determined by their primary sequence and any subsequent post-translational modifications. This statement is true as a ultimate cause, but you are indeed correct that other, proximal causes exist. I'll make a note about this on the talk page and bring other minds to bear. <a  title="User:TimVickers">TimVickers</a> 13:53, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comments</b> I didn't notice this before, but the sentence containing the Paracelsus quote in the inhibition section needs a citation (and possibly a rewrite). I still cringe at saying activity is "determined" by structure but for an article at this level it's a minor point. Pending other input I'd still also suggest moving or at least reformatting the table; it's by far the largest section in terms of screen real estate and it's also the least important. But the latter two are stylistic issues and, in terms of content, if the Paracelsus quote is cited I <b>support</b> this nomination. <a  title="User:Opabinia regalis">Opabinia regalis</a> 02:25, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

It would also be a good idea to include all PMIDs and ISBNs on your footnotes and references: PMIDs are easy to add, and provide a direct link to the studies. There are patches of text that don't have inline citations. This looks like a copyedit issue, not sure: "However, some cofactors known as prosthetic groups are covalently bound (e.g.'Italic text, thiamine pyrophosphate in the enzyme pyruvate dehydrogenase)." You should remove all external jumps, for example, on "The International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology has developed ...

<dd>I'd also cut down the See also-section, things like molecule have been linked in the article so don't need a See also in my opinion: if two concepts are truely linked, they should be wikilinked in the text itself, with See also used sparingly, I think.

<dd>Thank you for your comments, but I'm puzzled. "Molecule" isn't linked in "See Also" and there are only 4 links in this section. I have moved the PDB "Molecule of the Month" external link to the proteins article, as I think this is what you were referring to. I have also tried to simplify the introduction a little, but as you can see above, some reviewers have suggested this is already oversimplified! If you had any specific suggestions on areas we have missed and need to be added in order for the article to be more comprehensive, then I would be happy to try to include them.

<p><b>Comment</b>:Overall, this is an excellent article, but my impression is that it's not quite FA level. Here are some suggestions for improvements:</p>
<ul>
<li><s>The article seems a little too slanted towards protein enzymes; consider re-wording the first two sentences and the discussion of folding to treat RNA and proteins on a more equal footing. This article should be written so that it may be linked from, e.g., the ribozyme, ribosome and RNA world hypothesis pages.</s></li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Although the principles are the same, I'm sticking to the dictionary definition of <a  class="external text" title="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=enzyme" rel="nofollow">Enzyme</a> in this article.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><s>Instead of the vague "millions of times faster" in the second paragraph, how about using the example of orotate decarboxylase, which if I recall correctly accelerates its reactions by k<sub>cat</sub>/K</s>M/k<sub>uncatalyzed</sub> = 10<sup>23</sup> M<sup>-1</sup> under optimal conditions?</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Superb example. Thank you. Added to introduction.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><s>An example of extreme enzyme specificity would be good. A sentence or two about the trade-off between specificity and binding energy would be good</s>.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Excellent point. Since a binding energy discussion risks becoming over-technical for general reader (and has a lot to do with turnover rate also), I added a section on proofreading enzymes as a more accessible example of extremely specific enzymes, with references to DNA polymerase, ribosomes and aaRS.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><s>You might want to link to Lineweaver-Burk and Eadie-Hofstee in the kinetics section. Some description of how enzyme assays are carried out (or a few links) and how the kinetic parameters/MM parameters are determined experimentally might be good. The relation V<sub>max</sub> = k<sub>cat</sub> [Enzyme]<sub>tot</sub> might be helpful, since k<sub>cat</sub> seems to appear without explanation.</s></li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Link to <a href="/wiki/Enzyme_assay.html" title="Enzyme assay">Enzyme assays</a> added. Definition of kcat added. I put links to those plots on the <a href="/wiki/Enzyme_kinetics.html" title="Enzyme kinetics">Enzyme kinetics</a> page, since they are not for the casual reader!</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><s>I would mention uncompetitive and suicide inhibitors, and write the non-competitive inhibition section to be more plausible. A lay-person will undoubtedly ask, "If the inhibitor binds so far away, how does it affect the active site?"</s></li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>This section was muddled. I've clarified non-competitve inhibitors and divided the section into reversible and non-reversible inhibitors.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><s>The cofactor/coenzyme discussion seems split up into two places? A fuller description of what they're doing in catalysis would be good, e.g., electron sink. Some prosthetic groups cannot be removed to form the apoenzyme, e.g., the pyruvate cofactor in the pyruvoyl enzymes (e.g., amino-acid decarboxylases).</s></li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I really think these are some of the most annoying terms in enzymology! I split co-enzymes (substrates) from co-factors (bound components of enzyme structure) to try to emphasise that the two types of compounds are very different (in a strict usage of these decidedly loose terms!). Stryer divides cofactors (structural) from coenzymes (substrates) but adds that bound coenzymes are called prosthetic groups (what a muddle!). I'll merge these sections and disambiguate as much as possible. I've also added a bit on the role of co-factors, using heme and flavin as examples. Prosthetic groups are mentioned in the last paragraph of the co-factors section.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><s>At the risk of being too technical, the article should allow the possibility of seeing an actual enzyme mechanism, to make the thermodynamics come to life and illustrate <i>how</i> the transition state is stabilized preferentially to the substrate and product. Perhaps chymotrypsin?</s></li>
</ul>

<dd>These animations are linked and explained on the <a href="/wiki/Enzyme_kinetics.html" title="Enzyme kinetics">Enzyme kinetics</a> page.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>A discussion of general acid-base catalysis versus other types of mechanisms seems appropriate. More generally, a sentence or two about how alternative mechanisms are discerned (e.g., pH dependence, mutagenesis, chemical modification, stable isotope labeling, transition-state analogs, spectroscopy, deuterium kinetic effects, etc.) would be excellent.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I think this is out of the scope of this introductory article written for the general reader. These concepts are touched on briefly in the <a href="/wiki/Enzyme_kinetics.html" title="Enzyme kinetics">Enzyme kinetics</a> article, but even here no experimental details are given. Perhaps you could have a look at that page and add some comments at <a  title="Wikipedia:Peer review/Enzyme kinetics">Wikipedia:Peer review/Enzyme kinetics</a>?</dd>

<p><b>More comments</b>&#160;;) The improvements are excellent, particularly your handling of orotate DC. I think the header section needs more work on its writing and organization, though:</p>
<ul>

<li><b>Support</b> — I supported this article during its last nomination and — near the end of it — agreed to <a  title="User:JimmyBlackwing">User:JimmyBlackwing</a>'s request that I give it a copyedit, so as to improve quality further and dispell concerns over the prose. This has been a very informative article on the subject since at least the third nomination (I wasn't here for the first two), and I've felt like it was either at FA or really close to it during that last process. Though I haven't participated in any further improvement since the last FAC, I know its regular editors have and I do believe this article is now ready. <a  title="User:Ryu Kaze">Ryu Kaze</a> 14:49, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Oppose</b> - Structure. I'd <i>really</i> like to see the "History" section go at the top of the article. I've also given thought that some of the other sections could possibly be reordered a little, such as moving the themes section up, having plot before characters, but I'm less dead set on those. Additionally, for comprehensiveness' sake, I believe that it would be notable to talk (at least briefly) about the comic's fanbase, which has on a number of occasions overwhelmed conventions Fred has appeared at. Some mention of the author's reputation as being too self-disparaging might also be in line (particularly the penny-arcade thing). <a  title="User:Fieari">Fieari</a> 17:54, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: I've moved the sections around. Is that better? Also, Characters is above Plot on purpose - see articles like <i><a href="/wiki/Final_Fantasy_VII.html" title="Final Fantasy VII">Final Fantasy VII</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Final_Fantasy_X.html" title="Final Fantasy X">Final Fantasy X</a></i> or <i><a href="/wiki/Shadow_of_the_Colossus.html" title="Shadow of the Colossus">Shadow of the Colossus</a></i>. While these are all articles about video games, the principle is the same. <s>As for the comic's fanbase... while it may be notable, I'm having a hard time believing it's <i>verifiable</i>. The only semi-usable comments about the fanbase I've heard are from Gallagher himself, but even they are questionable. And discussing the author's reputation seems to veer off into non-notable trivia, to me - he has an article of his own for mentioning stuff like that.</s> <a  title="User:JimmyBlackwing">JimmyBlackwing</a> 19:29, 1 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Characters should be before Story in my opinion. It's easier to talk about a story when the characters have already been introduced. That's why those three articles JimmyBlackwing mentioned (which I wrote in large part) are organized as they are. If you don't put the Characters section first, it's not going to serve very much purpose since the Story section would then have to go about introducing the characters anyway. That just ends up making the Story section unnecessarily bloated, unfocused and incoherent. <a  title="User:Ryu Kaze">Ryu Kaze</a> 20:02, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>OK, I've read through it and have some more notes (I'm sure after 2/3 FACs the editors of this article are getting sick of me - sorry about that&#160;:))&#160;:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li><s>(feel free to ignore this one, as I'm not sure how much MoS-style factors in here) "now" is used in the first sentence - perhaps "as of" or similar should be used</s></li>
<li><s>" it has received negative criticism as a result of Gallagher's changes" - this seems like a POV statement to me, and perhaps is best left to the reception section</s>
<dl>
<dd>That's not POV. It's a fact that the comic has recieved criticism for this reason, and sources for that fact are cited in the article. (On the other hand, isn't "negative criticism" redundant?) --<a  title="User:L33tminion">L33tminion</a> <a  title="User talk:L33tminion">(talk)</a> 01:13, 2 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>"Negative criticism" isn't redundant, no. "Criticism" isn't inherently negative. It's just rigid analysis. Criticism can be positive. <a  title="User:Ryu Kaze">Ryu Kaze</a> 01:22, 2 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><s>The intro paragraphs are missing the comic's IMPACT. For example, there should be some kind of BANG that says "this is unquestionably popular." Maybe website hits i.e. "is a webcomic which at the height of its popularity brought in X visitors a day." Right now it just says it is a webcomic that has a positive reception...</s>
<dl>
<dd>I don't follow your reasoning behind this, actually. Why is that required for the article to meet featured standard? If someone can think of a way to add that sort of information that's NPOV, I don't oppose that, but still. --<a  title="User:L33tminion">L33tminion</a> <a  title="User talk:L33tminion">(talk)</a> 01:13, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><s>What is <i>"Dead Piro" filler art</i>? This really interrupts the flow of that part of the article for me, as it doesn't seem obvious to me what it is</s>
<dl>
<dd>Fixed that bit. Piro (Gallagher) refers to the days where he publishes filler art instead of a full comic as "Dead Piro Days". I found the easy solution was to remove the reference to that piece of trivia. If someone wants to readd it, then that will need to be explained. --<a  title="User:L33tminion">L33tminion</a> <a  title="User talk:L33tminion">(talk)</a> 01:30, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Multiple (if you ignore the fact that Ping <i>is</i> a video game in some sense). Personally, I think "in video game battle" sounds better and is more accurate than either "in a video game battle" or "in video game battles". Largo's conflict with Ping (and Miho) is ongoing. Nonetheless, if it's really confusing, it should be changed. --<a  title="User:L33tminion">L33tminion</a> <a  title="User talk:L33tminion">(talk)</a> 01:13, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> - why is there an RSS feed link in the infobox? It seems to be a parameter in the infobox, presumably agreed upon by WikiProject Webcomics. But surely an RSS feed is just a way of subscribing to the comic? Why should Wikipedia provide a link to that service? We should link to the website, but to actually provide an RSS feed link seems like advertising: <i>"subscribe to this comic here"</i>. I know this is a general WikiProject Comics thing, but I'd like to know what people here think, and whether anyone can provide links to discussions at the WikiProject. <a  title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 14:13, 4 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Why should a non-contentious fact such as "In 1931, Dalí painted his most famous work, The Persistence of Memory." be referenced?

<dd>It's just the way we do things around here. It's important to reassure our readers of the quality of articles, and it helps everyone to resist the temptation to include original research.

In case you cannot access MUSE, an excerpt from the article reads, "In 1960, Dalí had abjured those principles and, to mark his re-birth into Catholicism, he filled his new sky with bishops approaching heaven. This religious conversion shocked the Surrealists. Dalí sent his Sistine Madonna (also known as Ear with Madonna) to the International Exhibition of Surrealism organized at the D'Arcy Galleries in New York in December 1960. Infuriated by his inclusion in the Surrealist retrospective, André Breton published one of the many anti-Dalinian leaflets he would publish in his lifetime. On this occasion it was titled "We Don't Ear it that Way." In his leaflet, Breton made a mockery of Dalí's religious conversion and the text contained a brutal attack on Gala, whom the painter had used as a model for the Madonna in spite of the fact that her sexual behavior was a constant source of scandal throughout the European tabloid press..." --<a  title="User:DanielNuyu">DanielNuyu</a></li>

<li>Because some editors here feel that protecting people from knowledge is more important than Wikipedia's objective of spreading knowledge (hint: look at the spoiler tag).

Darth Sidious and Palpatine were two separate articles created before <i>Revenge of the Sith</i> was released when their relationship was not confirmed in the fiction.

<li>This is the standard practice for plot summaries from film- and television-related articles. It has always been understood that the work described is the reference. Look at the other film, television, video game, and character featured articles. <a  title="User:Dmoon1">Dmoon1</a> 20:26, 2 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>While I agree with Dmoon1 in principle, in practice I personally use references for plot-related stuff, especially when there might be some disagreement among fans as to what something means. (Examples: <a href="/wiki/Final_Fantasy_VII.html" title="Final Fantasy VII">Final Fantasy VII</a> and <a href="/wiki/Final_Fantasy_X-2.html" title="Final Fantasy X-2">Final Fantasy X-2</a>) In either case, I personally wouldn't object over something like this, as it <i>is</i> understood that the work being discussed is itself the reference. Even so, I would advise you, Dmoon, to add plot-related references sometimes. Even if only one per paragraph or something like that (a general rule of thumb for most people who stick to this practice is two per paragraph). Again, not because I think this is a reason to object, but because sourcing this stuff 1) prevents any concerns over a lack of sources for information in the article, and 2) it prevents anyone who had a different interpretation of something from removing what's been verified and replacing it with fanfiction. So to summarize: it's not really grounds for objection, but sourcing plot info <i>is</i> a good idea because it provides other benefits. <a  title="User:Ryu Kaze">Ryu Kaze</a> 21:33, 2 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><s><b>Object</b>.</s> Nice article but I'd like to see the licencing of the images explained better. A photograph taken by a Japanese sailor is not a "work of a sailor or employee of the U.S. Navy, taken or made during the course of the person's official duties". Japanese war art is not work of the US Federal Government. That these images have at some point made their way into US government archives doesn't <i>ipso facto</i> mean that they are in the public domain. Or if it does then I'd like to see the image description pages explaining how. <a  title="User:Haukurth">Haukur</a> 09:42, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>There are a lot of images in the U.S. National Archives and other US government historical agencies that were made by the Imperial Japanese government or the Imperial Japanese Navy or Army. The U.S. government websites or other sources of the images state very clearly that they are public domain (for example: <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.history.navy.mil/branches/org11-2.htm" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>) It appears that they are public domain for several reasons: (1) Japanese copyright law is "Death (termination) + 50"; the Imperial Japanese government terminated in 1945, making any of the images they produced public domain 50 years later, (2) the U.S. government believes that those images are property of the US government because the US government absorbed the Imperial Japanese government into itself during the Allied (primarily US) <a href="/wiki/Occupied_Japan.html" title="Occupied Japan">occupation</a> of Japan including all of its properties, and (3) when I've looked at the files for Imperial Japanese government images on the Japanese Wikipedia, the editors there usually use the "all rights released by the author" tag for the images, if not the "US Government public domain tag", from what I can understand because upon the dissolution of the Imperial Japanese government in 1945, its images and documents were released from copyright into the public domain. Is there anything anywhere that expressly states what I've said above instead of by implication? Not that I'm aware of. However, if the U.S. Government says that those are public domain images, and they clearly state that, I think that's good enough. <a  title="User:Cla68">Cla68</a> 10:18, 1 September 2006 (UTC)

<p>This was a <a  title="WP:DYK">WP:DYK</a> a month ago, originally my rough machine-assisted translation of part of a page from the French Wikipedia but now supplemented and expanded substantially, with the help of some comments on its <a  title="Wikipedia:Peer review/Dürer's Rhinoceros">peer review</a> and <a  title="Talk:Dürer's Rhinoceros">talk page</a>.

<li>Do you mean the way the footnote numbers in text go [14] then [15] then [6]?

<li>That's exactly what I mean. Whether we allow it here or not, it's bad style and I doubt that it's used by any academic works. I don't want to attempt to hold up the fac in order to make a point, but it's simply pitiful style, and nearly any careful reader would see it as being an error. --<a  title="User:Zantastik"><font color="black">Zantastik</font></a> <a  title="User talk:Zantastik"><font color="darkgreen" size="1">talk</font></a> 01:25, 3 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>How is it an error when it's going back to a source used previously? This isn't grounds to object. This style of referencing is currently the most widely accepted version on Wikipedia. Personal disfavor for that style is not a valid reason to hold up an FAC. FAC is the <i>last</i> place to use <a  title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>. It's a grave disrespect to the editors who have put their work into an article. Such an offense for the sake of an individual's personal tastes or agenda isn't worth it. <a  title="User:Ryu Kaze">Ryu Kaze</a> 01:40, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I don't like the style at all myself, but I believe that I have previously seen it, or something very much like it, in at least one academic journal in medicine or the natural sciences. It's well suited to those areas, because typically references there are to the <i>findings</i> of (rather than to interesting bits within) short research papers: there's seldom much point in, say, referring specifically to p.351 within an article running pp.350–353. This in turn means that repeated references to the same paper won't bring up the awkward matter of page numbers; whereas in WP articles on history, aesthetics, linguistics, etc., one is often forced to make a choice between (a) suppressing page numbers (awkward for the person wanting to follow up a note) and (b) having full notes (with duplication of bibliographic trivia) for each page number that's referenced (ugly and ridiculous).

<li>I'm sorry, but this is an artefact of the &lt;ref&gt; footnote system.

If the title of this article were to be like every other one on a work of art then it would be <b>The Rhinoceros (Dürer)</b>; it seems more encyclopaedic to me, my rationale here being that the image would never be referred to as <i>Dürer's Rhinoceros</i> in italics, unlike, say, <i>Whistler's Mother</i> (and the same is true of the formulation <i>Michelangelo's David</i>). Admittedly, the title as it is is more elegant; a case of <a  title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a>, perhaps, even though there are no formal standards on how to title articles on artworks yet? My point probably comes across as nit-picking, but I'd just like to hear what the nominator makes of it. <small>[<i><a  title="User talk:Ham">talk to the</a></i>]</small> <a  title="User:Ham">H<small>AM</small></a> 20:09, 3 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>Thanks for the link. An interesting conundrum, but, in the absence of a more specific naming policy, I would fall back on using the most common name in English. While the British Museum may call it <i>The Rhinoceros</i>, the more common name appears to be "<a href="/wiki/D%C3%BCrer%27s_Rhinoceros.html" title="Dürer's Rhinoceros">Dürer's Rhinoceros</a>". For what it is worth, I would put <a href="/wiki/Michelangelo%27s_David.html" title="Michelangelo's David">Michelangelo's David</a> there, as the most common name of the work in English, rather than at <a href="/wiki/David_%28Michelangelo%29.html" title="David (Michelangelo)">David (Michelangelo)</a>. -- <a  title="User:ALoan">ALoan</a> <a  title="User talk:ALoan">(Talk)</a> 20:25, 3 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>As a way of acknowledging that the conundrum exists, might it be a good idea to rephrase the opening sentence as "Dürer's Rhinoceros is the name commonly given to a woodcut..."? The more I look at that first sentence, the more deficient it seems. I have no other problems with the article; on the contrary, it's made an art-loving Wikipedian very happy! <small>[<i><a  title="User talk:Ham">talk to the</a></i>]</small> <a  title="User:Ham">H<small>AM</small></a> 20:54, 4 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>My only question then is "What is missing?". I can't make up negative things about the ballpark. The article simply states all of the facts about the ballpark, which does include the fact that it has won awards and been praised by architects, etc. I dug very deep to find something negative in a reliable verifiable source about the ballpark. What I found was the ticket price commentary; some believe that ticket prices are too high for this class of ballpark. If I found something else, I would have included it also, but I did not find anything. Again, I cannot make up negative things to include about the ballpark if those who are qualified to professionally comment on such things can't either. — <a  title="User:Scm83x">Scm83x</a> <sup><a  title="User talk:Scm83x">hook 'em</a></sup> 20:01, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h3><a href="/wiki/Fuck_the_Millennium.html" title="Fuck the Millennium">Fuck the Millennium</a></h3>
<p>This is an article about the 1997 comeback of <a href="/wiki/The_KLF.html" title="The KLF">The KLF</a>, when they released a song of the same name as 2K and undertook various other pre-millennial activities as K2 Plant Hire. I believe the article complies with <a  title="Wikipedia:What is a featured article?">the FA requirements</a> and is very well written. It uses a small number of fair use images to which the proper rationales have been applied. I would like to acknowledge my friend <a  title="User:Vinoir">Vinoir</a> as the main author of this piece, with which I have assisted him. --<a  title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 13:36, 15 August 2006 (UTC) Sorry, I forgot to mention: this article has been passed as a <a  title="WP:GOOD">Good Article</a> and has undergone <a  title="Wikipedia:Peer review/Fuck the Millennium">a peer review</a>. --<a  title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 13:53, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Object</b> The lead is too short and there is no mention of the cultural significance of the song (since the song came out nine years ago, there should be some books or articles which now place it in a proper cultural and historic framework). In addition, the article needs a criticism section b/c as it is now, the article reads as merely a promotional piece for the song and group.--<a  title="User:Alabamaboy">Alabamaboy</a> 16:31, 15 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Thanks for the comments.
<ul>
<li>I'm aware of <a  title="WP:LEAD">WP:LEAD</a> but I think in this case the lead is an adequate summation of the article. Can you tell me what themes you'd like to see added to it? With that information I can attempt to expand it.</li>
<li>The song and the Barbican performance are hard to separate. The song itself didn't get much press attention separate from the Barbican show and only reached #28 in the UK singles chart. That, indeed, Drummond later claimed was the <i>whole point</i> - it was a vacuous, crappy comeback that was in concept an art piece. Cultural significance of the song? None??&#160;:)</li>
<li>You're right that we don't have more recent critical commentary. I'm not sure there is any, but I will search the Library of Mu and my own archive of recent press clippings and see if I can come up with anything. Will post back on this point.</li>
<li>"The article reads as merely a promotional piece for the song and group." This is an objection we had regarding <a href="/wiki/The_KLF.html" title="The KLF">The KLF</a> also, and one which is a little cutting. We try to reference every statement we make, and we <i>don't</i> shop for quotes that present the group in a favourable light. As I've said when this issue has been raised previously, the British press love The KLF and barely write a word against them <i>ever</i>. In this case, we have quotes saying that in the show they did "too many things at the same time" (The Observer), "the strongest point in its favour was its brevity" - a statement of crapness if ever I saw one (The Times), "the anticlimactic aftertaste left by 40-year-old men miming to a seven-year-old song.... 2K was unquestionably a failure" (Select Magazine). Indeed the <i>only</i> reference which praises them is from Select Magazine again: "It is quite brilliant". I think one positive review out of 4 is hardly fawning&#160;:)</li>

<li>I've expanded the lead to mention "The People's Pyramid". I believe it now mentions all salient points and is a good summary of the article. --<a  title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 14:17, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I've located a couple of more recent references (1999 and 2001) and have worked them into the article <a  class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Fuck_the_Millennium&amp;diff=71413005&amp;oldid=71387964" rel="nofollow">diff</a>. I don't think they add a huge amount, but it's nice to finish with Drummond's summation of how 2K's failure was a success in itself. I trust this answers your objections and hope you will feel moved enough to support. --<a  title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 16:59, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Are opinions here actually <i>divided</i>?
<ul>
<li>As exhaustively researched as can be fathomed — aided by the size of the subject and the readily available material, of course, but FA is equal opportunity when it comes to subject size. The despairing reliance on online material that's seen sometimes here is overcome by virtual librarians, culling material out of <a href="/wiki/Ephemera.html" title="Ephemera">ephemeral</a> print matter so that they can arrive at the last place on earth where they will ever see the light of day. (People — get out your old <i><a href="/wiki/Melody_Maker.html" title="Melody Maker">Melody Makers</a></i>, your <i><a href="/wiki/Rolling_Stone.html" title="Rolling Stone">Rolling Stones</a></i> — what have you. Make them live again, as they will never do otherwise!)</li>
<li>Can't think of any other major sides of this subject one could cover, either. This thing is really like a time capsule — I can almost <i>smell</i> England in the mid-1990s, something I will never experience in person. And the idea of a shallow event, a self-admitted blunder, making FA and the possibility of <i>that</i> gracing the Front Page — can you say one last, ultimate practical joke?</li>
<li>Okay, one thing. Under what circumstances did they land on <a href="/wiki/Mute_Records.html" title="Mute Records">Mute Records</a>? I just happen to be intrigued by various things Mute, so I happened to notice that little bit.

And also, even if it didn't have much attention but this single was released in UK, japan , france and elswhere.

<li>Thanks for your comments. This is very <i>very</i> different from <a href="/wiki/Cool_%28song%29.html" title="Cool (song)">Cool (song)</a>. The latter is an article on a new pop song; this is an article about a remixing and reworking of an old song and the <i>attendant events</i>. "Cool" is a piece of music, "Fuck the Millennium" was a campaign which just happened to have a theme tune&#160;:). This article has plenty of information that Cool doesn't have, and should be judged on its own merits. Is it comprehensive/brilliantly written/well referenced? Is it a standout piece on Wikipedia? I think yes, and I hope you will reconsider because we were dangerously close to a support consensus I feel&#160;:)</li>

<li>We have a "composition" section, and we provide a sample of the song.

As for reaction in France and Japan, I don't speak either of those languages and don't have any reference material from them. This was a British event - including a show at the Barbican and the plans for the Peoples Pyramid somewhere in the UK. <a href="/wiki/Cool_%28song%29.html" title="Cool (song)">Cool (song)</a> is not terribly international either (just look at the notes &amp; references, all web-based and none from non-English speaking countries). The only difference is that is has some overseas chart data. I'm not aware that FTM charted anywhere outside the UK, but if anyone is able to provide a reliable source with some overseas chart data I'd be delighted to include it. --<a  title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 18:48, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<h3><a href="/wiki/Ketuanan_Melayu.html" title="Ketuanan Melayu">Ketuanan Melayu</a></h3>
<p>I've been working on this article for several months now, and I think it's at featured level. I'm just putting some finishing touches on it here and there, but otherwise I don't foresee any major changes being made to the article's structure. I think the article might need a couple of extra pictures to break the monotony of plain text (one was removed some time ago for being incorrectly uploaded as PD), but otherwise I believe it meets the requisite standards for writing and referencing (with about 200 footnotes, I think I might have gone overboard). The only major issue I foresee (which was discussed at the <a  title="Wikipedia:Peer review/Ketuanan Melayu">peer review</a> three months ago; little has changed since then) is that of size. The article clocks in at about 15,000 words (and this is a conservative estimate, excluding footnotes, section headers, the ToC, etc.). However, I don't think it detrimentally affects the article's readability, which is the main point of our guidelines on article size (although there are also technical issues, confining ourselves to 32kb would mean defeaturing a large number of FAs). The article is so readable that sometimes I find myself caught up in reading it whenever I want to make some formatting change (although I'm rather biased as I wrote most of it). Just in case nobody's noticed, as we always used to say...this is a self-nom. <a  title="User:Johnleemk">Johnleemk</a> | <a  title="User talk:Johnleemk">Talk</a> 19:18, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Neutral</b> - The article is simply too long. I've helped with some long featured articles, but you're going to need to use summary style here in at least a couple sections. Maybe one on Malaysian independence and another on the new economic policy? The prose is just too much and too unbroken IMHO. <a  title="User:InvictaHOG">InvictaHOG</a> 19:45, 5 August 2006 (UTC) (Have reexamined the article - four days later is still too long and has not begun to utilize summary style.

<dd>The problem is that everything ties in so well with the topic (Malay political supremacy/dominance, and the rationales for it). It's hard deciding what to cut. Believe me, if I knew how to implement summary style here, I would. I dislike unwieldy articles as much as the next fellow. Still, sometimes articles on detailed and nuanced topics (especially when it comes to politics) have to be long in order to incorporate multiple viewpoints. <a  title="User:Johnleemk">Johnleemk</a> | <a  title="User talk:Johnleemk">Talk</a> 09:21, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As a side-note, that's a red herring; I've never suggested that we alter articles which effectively utilise summary style.

<dd>I assume that you are addressing me as far as the red herring is concerned? I believe that parts of your article would work well with the summary style and have suggested a few to convert, as have others. It's often the case that a long section flows particularly well but is simply too long and involved for the parent article. My comment was simply to acknowledge how hard it can be to take well-written prose, summarize it, and present the rest in a linked page. I think it is the right thing to do, however! <a  title="User:InvictaHOG">InvictaHOG</a> 01:46, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Robth suggests below that doing so would be difficult (if not impossible) here because of the tight focus on Malay supremacy. Almost everything irrelevant to it has been trimmed; the problem is that like another long FA, <a href="/wiki/AIDS.html" title="AIDS">AIDS</a>, some sections are closely related to other articles (I've marked these articles as main ones for the sections in question), but it's impossible to trim them further because everything in the article either deals directly with Malay supremacy, or explains the necessary context for understanding the events. I suppose one could wring a few extra kilobytes from junking some quotes here and there (at the cost of reducing the number of viewpoints on Malay supremacy that are represented; I've tried hard to ensure each quote brings something unique to the table that's directly related to the topic; those that didn't have been cut), but aside from that, I think the 27kb I've cut since this FAC commenced really ought to suffice. AIDS, a similarly complicated topic, also has a number of sections without main articles. I don't think that's a mark against it, and especially not against <i>ketuanan Melayu</i>, since the article on it is so tightly focused. <a  title="User:Johnleemk">Johnleemk</a> | <a  title="User talk:Johnleemk">Talk</a> 20:20, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Although this is not a FAC about AIDS, I think it's okay to comment that most sections on <a href="/wiki/AIDS.html" title="AIDS">AIDS</a> have subarticles and that the two largest without, treatment and "symptoms," would do much better with their own article because right now they are woefully incomplete despite being long. That said, I will reread this article in the next day or so and see how it has changed from 36 hours ago when I last read it. I appreciate the efforts that have been made to reduce length, but I don't think that summary style would fail this article. <a  title="User:InvictaHOG">InvictaHOG</a> 16:10, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>You know, I've just spent at least 30 minutes reading the article and really appreciate the hard work that has gone into it. It's well-written and I applaud the main article inclusions of full articles. However, I think that the main article still retains too much information to be considered our best work. You may have to change the sentences or rewrite sections to trim some of the bulk. Large parts of the Malayan Union and Towards Independence sections, for instance, really do not add much to my understanding of the topic. Sure, things are there to be all-inclusive. However, I think that there is an element of the forest for the trees here - far too many trees, too many people, too many organizations which end up clouding the overall move from British rule through today. I wish I felt differently! <a  title="User:InvictaHOG">InvictaHOG</a> 18:00, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>(deindent) Thanks, that's really helpful. I tried to cut down the sections you mentioned and clarify the relevance of some events to the topic of Malay supremacy. I think there might be a chance we could squeeze a bit more out of the article and get it below 100kb, but as I said, I have trouble finding things to cut because of my inherent bias.

<dd><b>Support</b> excellent read. Just two minor comments on some text:
<ul>
<li>In the article, it says <i>"British at the same time ... involving only the Malay ruling class in government and administrative issues."</i> . I believe this extends to military as well. The British failed to arm the non-Malays, in order to "preserve the position of the British" by putting one race over the others. The consequence was that the Chinese (who were staunchly anti-Japanese) were not mobilised to defend against the Japanese in WWII, until the call-up of a multi-racial Singapore Volunteer Corp in December 1941; but it was too late. The Malay Regiment fought bravely, but had the non-Malays also been mobilised, armed and trained, the Allied would have a much better chance to defend Malaya and Singapore. The article <a href="/wiki/Royal_Malay_Regiment.html" title="Royal Malay Regiment">Royal Malay Regiment</a> mentions some related issues.</li>
<li>In the article, it says <i>"Eventually, the Tunku — fed up with all the politicking — decided to ask Singapore, ... to secede from Malaysia."</i> I don't know what exactly was Tunku's reason for making that fateful decision, but I hope it was more than just being "fed up" because it changed the destiny of 2 million people and I had to give up 2.5 years of my life to the SAF as a result,&#160;;-). Could you elaborate further on that sentence? --<a  title="User:Vsion">Vsion</a> 06:59, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The problem with your first concern is that it seems to be a bit of a novel interpretation of historical events. All the sources I looked at for this article cite only the British policies of segregation by geographic locality and profession; there's not much mention of the military (although I might try to go through Roff's book again and hunt for some reference to it, generally most scholars don't make much of the military - at least not until post-May 13). And as for the defense of Malaya and Singapore, I'm not sure that's entirely appropriate for this article's scope. I've tried to make the Tunku's stand clearer, but for a more nuanced view of the situation, I recommend the books by Patrick Keith and Noordin Sopiee (the latter may be hard to find, though) cited in the references. The article focuses on separation with a lens geared towards how <i>ketuanan Melayu</i> influenced events; as a result, a more complete perspective the topic warrants can only be found in a treatment with a specific scope limited to separation. <a  title="User:Johnleemk">Johnleemk</a> | <a  title="User talk:Johnleemk">Talk</a> 09:21, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Nice job in clarifying the "secession" sentence. For my first point, on WWII preparation, it is not really an "actionable" comment, rather just for infor. I read it from Frank Owen "Fall of Singapore" (1972). I don't have the precise quote, but basically it said that the British were hestitant to allow non-Malays to carry arms and fight as it would legitimise their stake in Malaya and erode the Malay "supremacy", and would make it more difficult for British to rule. Many factors led to the Fall of Malaya and Singapore, so we can't draw conclusion on that. Nonetheless, prior to Japanese invasion, the infantry regiments raised from the local population were either of European descents or Malays. Note that these regiments could be used for internal security operations as well, and that they were exclusively Malays was symbolically significant. --<a  title="User:Vsion">Vsion</a> 04:20, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Comments:</b></p>
<ol>
<li>This is a remarkably comprehensive article, but the length is a problem. I found it quite difficult to read, even though I am interested in the topic. Perhaps a few of the many quotations could be removed or reduced in length?</li>
<li>In the opening sentence "the racialist belief that the Malay people are the "tuan" (masters) of Malaysia or Malaya" the use of the word "racialist" so early in the article carries a hint of POV. Would supporters of the policy agree that it is racialist? It might be better to drop the word and let readers decide for themselves.</li>
<li>With nearly 200 footnotes, it is difficult to find the note which gives the full details of the work being cited. A separate alphabetical list of "References" would make this easier.<a  title="User:Rhion">Rhion</a> 12:08, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I agree the length is an issue, and I'll go over the article again looking for quotes. However, the problem is that unlike more fact-based articles, <i>ketuanan Melayu</i> is a very heated and opinionated topic which cannot be treated comprehensively without referring to the variety of opinions related to it. We discussed cutting quotes at the peer review, but it was just too hard to find more than a couple to remove. Still, I suppose one or two can go, although I find most of the lengthy quotes help provide an insight into the viewpoints of <i>ketuanan Melayu'</i>s more extreme attackers and defenders (the quotes from Lee, Mahathir, and the anonymous UMNO Youth leader are what I have in mind here). As for racialism, the anonymous UMNO Youth leader quoted in the <i>Bangsa Malaysia</i> subsection specifically refers to UMNO Youth's ideals and actions as racialist ("we [UMNO Youth] have to be often seen as a very racialist political group fighting for the Malay interests"). <a href="/wiki/Racialism.html" title="Racialism">Racialism</a> is different from <a href="/wiki/Racism.html" title="Racism">racism</a>, as the latter advocates discrimination on the basis of race, while the former merely implies that there are differences between racial groups. And the idea for a general references section is a good one; I'll go ahead and implement it. <a  title="User:Johnleemk">Johnleemk</a> | <a  title="User talk:Johnleemk">Talk</a> 12:45, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I liked this when it was on peer review, and I like it now. 131 kb is a lot, but I think it's justified by the subject matter, which demands that the article make forays into a broad range of topics. I was involved in the effort to cut the size of this on peer review, and was surprised to find that there was very little fat to trim. The article is quite readable, despite its length, in large part thanks to a considered and cohesive narrative structure--a rarity in articles of this scope. Beyond that, it's impeccably referenced, well written, and an engaging read. <b>Support</b>. --<a  title="User:Robth">Robth</a><sup><a  title="User talk:Robth">Talk</a></sup> 18:01, 6 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>I've been asked to go into a little more depth on why I don't feel that summary style is appropriate here, so here goes. Summary style is perfect for certain types of articles; <a href="/wiki/Music_of_the_United_States.html" title="Music of the United States">Music of the United States</a> is a great example of a relatively recent FA in which it was exactly the right thing. Summary style works well there because the article contains a number of topics for which the section in the article should be a shorter version of the main article. Ketuanan Melayu is a different type of article. This article covers a number of topics, but focuses on the aspects of those topics that relate to Malayan racial politics, and limiting that specialized discussion in exchange for links to more generalized articles doesn't strike me as a good trade-off. I suppose you could chunk off awkward articles with titles like "Racial politics in Malaya, 19XX-YY", or something, but I'm not a big fan of unnatural breaking points of that sort. It's good to keep articles short where possible, but the available methods of shortening this have serious downsides, and on the balance I think that the best way to present this information is in the form of one big article. --<a  title="User:Robth">Robth</a><sup><a  title="User talk:Robth">Talk</a></sup> 17:12, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Object</b> Overall size of 131KB is not a problem. The real problem is the extremely large prose size, at 109KB. The article needs to make use of Sumary Style: I haven't even looked at the references, because there is too much content. I didn't look at the prose either, because first it needs to be cut down. The images don't appear to be in the clear; <b>JKelly should have a look.</b> <a  title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy</a> 18:33, 6 August 2006 (UTC) Changing to strong object, much too long, detail overburdens the reader, and not enough has been done to fix this. <a  title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy</a> 23:13, 21 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Tell me what to cut into a subarticle, and I'll cut it. I've worked with FAs that needed subarticles before, and have been responsible for chunking off a number of them (<a href="/wiki/Theodore_Roosevelt.html" title="Theodore Roosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a>, <a href="/wiki/Coca-Cola.html" title="Coca-Cola">Coca-Cola</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Mozilla_Firefox.html" title="Mozilla Firefox">Mozilla Firefox</a> come to mind). I can't find anything here that can be dumped into a subarticle without upsetting either the balance or flow of the article. As Robth notes, we discussed this in the peer review because I knew this would be a major issue. The problem is that there's just no way at present that this article can be summarised without hurting its comprehensiveness or flow. Try <i>reading</i> the prose before issuing summary judgements about it. And as for the images, I'm not one to abuse fair use or play tricks with copyrights. Three images in the article are public domain, cropped from larger photos produced by the U.S. Federal Government. One image is public domain because it was published before copyright law was extant in Malaysia and/or the U.S. Four images are copylefted because they were produced by Wikipedians. Four images are fair use, and I'll address them one by one because each case of fair use must be examined individually. The lead image depicts <a href="/wiki/Hishamuddin_Hussein.html" title="Hishamuddin Hussein">Hishamuddin Hussein</a>'s infamous brandishing of the <a href="/wiki/Kris.html" title="Kris">kris</a>; this is discussed in the section on Meritocracy, with even specific reference to the symbolism of the kris according to Hishamuddin. The second is fair use because it depicts a Malayan Union protest (these protests are discussed by the article in the context of how they were meant to defend <i>ketuanan Melayu</i>) and a famous slogan of the Malay nationalist movement which is also discussed by the article. The third fair use image depicts opposition politicians celebrating their victory in the 1969 election; these celebrations are also discussed by the article in the context of the <a href="/wiki/May_13_Incident.html" title="May 13 Incident">May 13 Incident</a>. The last fair use image (which may be questionable; I would not object if we removed it to be on the safe side) depicts an advertisement for a million-ringgit condomonium bearing a note in fine print remarking that <a href="/wiki/Bumiputra.html" title="Bumiputra">Bumiputra</a> will receive a certain discount. This is part of the pro-Malay affirmative action policies implemented by the government, which are also heavily discussed by the article. I don't see how the images are suspect, to be honest. <a  title="User:Johnleemk">Johnleemk</a> | <a  title="User talk:Johnleemk">Talk</a> 18:51, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Yeah, Sandy's right, the length is a problem. (1) Go through the whole text and remove anything that looks extraneous.

<li>The first auto-formatted date isn't working. I don't mind if you unblue all of them, but if they're blue, they should work.</li>
<li>"and an increased emphasis on the Malays being the "definitive people" of Malaysia — i.e. a Malay being one and the same as a Malaysian." Can you reword this to make it crystal clear. Does "definitive" mean "original"? For people who aren't aware of the distinction between Malay and Malaysian in the first place, it's hard to comprehend.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>"The National Culture Policy, also introduced in 1970"—where is the other thing that was done in 1970? Mention beforehand, or remove "also". Please go through and see how many "alsos" can be removed.
<ul>
<li>"prior to"—There's a lot of this term on WP—it's creeping in. Please consider using "before".</li>
<li>Much prefer roman rather that italic face for your quotes: italic is harder to read, which is why it's normally reserved for short highlightings. Looks messy on the page, too.</li>
<li>"However, the local-born non-Malay communities soon began"—Perhaps avoid starting a para with this. Can "however" be simply removed? It's a fresh start in a new para, after all.</li>

<dd>Pre-independence has its own subarticle now, although I wasn't able to prune much from the article. And if you actually read the section on Badawi, you'd know that there's nothing that can be cut - in the first place, it's already the shortest in the article. I don't know what's wrong with the date - it works fine for me. I've tried to clarify the meaning of definitive, but I don't see how the distinction between Malays and Malaysians can be made clear when the very first sentence of the article mentions Chinese and Indian Malaysians and their relationship with the Malays. The National Culture Policy and NEP were both introduced in 1970 - I thought that sentence was fine. (At the very least, I've seen such construction used without much issue before.) I'm not sure what's wrong with "prior to", unless somebody changed the rules of English and I didn't get the memo. I've removed the italic face, and tried to prune extraneous "however"s. <a  title="User:Johnleemk">Johnleemk</a> | <a  title="User talk:Johnleemk">Talk</a> 10:02, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I've really thought long and hard about how to shorten the sections on post-independent Malaya and Malaysia, but it's really difficult, especially because most of the content that would go in any article about a <a href="/wiki/Malaysian_Malaysia.html" title="Malaysian Malaysia">Malaysian Malaysia</a> is also relevant here. The Malaysian Malaysia campaign is the only direct political challenge ever towards Malay supremacy in Malaysia, so it's pretty difficult to exclude content there, although I suppose we could shorten one or two quotes. It's also difficult to trim the Bangsa Malaysia part because the policy represented a near total repudiation of Malay supremacy, so it's again a very important topic. <a  title="User:Johnleemk">Johnleemk</a> | <a  title="User talk:Johnleemk">Talk</a> 10:02, 7 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>I've taken the approach of pruning quotes which serve minimal purpose, as opposed to a full-scale summary style approach, simply because (as Robth noted) it would be difficult to do so without harming the narrative flow of the article. Additionally, as mentioned above, there are issues with comprehensiveness that make it difficult to decide what's worth summarising and what's worth keeping. The present situation may not be desirable, but it's difficult to summarise without omitting one side's view, or cutting the views of both sides down into a couple of sentences (that would be exceedingly easy to do, but I doubt it would bode well WRT comprehensiveness). I've already cut 11kb from the article. <a  title="User:Johnleemk">Johnleemk</a> | <a  title="User talk:Johnleemk">Talk</a> 20:13, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Um ... I <i>did</i> read the section on Badawi. Like the other sections, you need to retain just a summary here. A text can be reduced as much as you like using summary style: to 500w, 200w or 20w; you simply lower the threshold for detail. The level of detail is unsatisfactory in most of the article in this linguistic register. "The riots caused a major change in the government's approach to racial issues, and led to the introduction of an aggressive affirmative action policy strongly favouring the Malays, the New Economic Policy (NEP). The National Culture Policy, also introduced in 1970." Now, contrary to your rejoinder, "also" <i>is</i> a problem here: it indicates that something else was "introduced in 1970". Riots are <i>not</i> introduced; they occur or happen. So the reader still won't know that the riots were in 1970. Seeing a construction elsewhere doesn't at all mean that it's a good one. Please fix it. "PRIOR TO"—What is wrong with it is that it's unnecessarily elaborate, since there's a good, short, plain Germanic alternative: "before". What's wrong with "before", the way we've always done it? Date formatting: it works now, you're right. "Prior to" is an attempt to sound technically or legally precise (we all get sucked into that without realising it—"in order to" is another, where two words should be removed); the occasions when it's desirable rarely occur. Please use plain language: two syllables, not three; one word, not two; usually avoid Latinisms. You're right about the "definitive people" issue, now that I've read it again. There's another "However," starting a para. Please just remove it: it will be stronger and smoother. In fact, start with a more effective back-link by putting "At the same time, " first.</dd>

<dd>I like this artice: it's reasonably well written and covers an important story that needs to be known more widely. But it still needs work on the prose <i>and</i> severe pruning. Here's a <a  class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ketuanan_Melayu&amp;diff=68528719&amp;oldid=68465576|" rel="nofollow">random example</a> that I copy-edited from the middle of the article to show that there's considerable wordiness to rationalise. Why not gut the paragraph by removing from "Even so" to "Nevertheless,": the tussle over the name is secondary, here, and belongs in a daughter article. You'll engage more easily with readers by giving them just a summary—go through the whole text and identify the secondary, less important stuff that, when removed, won't damage the overall story. <a  title="User:Tony1">Tony</a> 02:45, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Huh? The riots weren't introduced (I never said that in the first place); the NEP was. And as for what's wrong with before, the point of using synonyms is variety. I was working on tightening the writing for the past couple of days before your edit, and I've cut 23kb from the article since this FAC began.</dd>
<dd>The problem with summary style here is that because of the nuanced nature of something this political and controversial, it's important to avoid oversimplifying or misrepresenting or simply omitting particular views. By removing a few quotes and improving the writing, I got rid of 17.6% of the article. Summary style has been mainly utilised in the Pre-independence section, but as I said, it's hard applying it anywhere in the article. I'm thinking about pruning the Malaysian Malaysia debate, but I can't figure out how. The NEP sections are also a prime choice for trimming, although I'm not sure what details ought to go. <a  title="User:Johnleemk">Johnleemk</a> | <a  title="User talk:Johnleemk">Talk</a> 21:39, 10 August 2006 (UTC)]</dd>

That's the only conceivable way (e.g. <a  class="new" title="Ketuanan Melayu in the 1960s">Ketuanan Melayu in the 1960s</a>, etc.) we could have subarticles for main sections.

<li><s><b>Comment</b></s> <b>Support</b> This article is biased. I do not have the time to wholly review it and pick out every single nuance, but it quite obviously leans against the policy (which is no doubt a form of supremacy and racism). It spends much time displaying good, reasoned arguments against it by ethnic Chinese opposition, and, in comparison, presents poor justification for the Malay point-of-view. I doubt that without significant input from those who are 'on the other side of the fence' (half the support voters appear to be Singaporean) it can be neutral.</li>

<dd>The problem is that the Indian community is marginalised in Malaysian politics, and as such tends to shy away from such issues. Since independence, the Chinese have dominated the ranks of the opposition; the DAP/PAP and Gerakan were/are both Chinese-based parties (although an argument can be made that Gerakan was multiracial). As such, all but a handful of works turn this into a polarised issue between Malay and Chinese. Those who do include the Indian perspective (such as Ongkili) don't have much to go on because the Indians have never been a force of their own in Malaysian politics. Even today, politics is often discussed in terms of Malay and Chinese (there's a joke which goes that "A Malay problem is a national problem; a Chinese problem is a racial problem; an Indian problem is not a problem!" which sums up the situation). <a  title="User:Johnleemk">Johnleemk</a> | <a  title="User talk:Johnleemk">Talk</a> 11:25, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The problem is that there are very few justifications provided for these policies beyond affirmative action and the historical Malay claim to the land, both of which are covered by the article. Practically all defences of Malay supremacy/the NEP use these two arguments; the article merely quotes and cites the most famous and/or eloquent ones. Otherwise, there isn't really much that can be said. There has never been a real attempt locally to discuss these issues since the 1970s, and most foreign sources are critical of the government stance; I suppose you could say the article suffers from a systemic bias in favour of published views. Where there are justifications for the government stand, I have tried to include them; the article covers a number of the NEP's strong points often overlooked by its attackers. The analogies of the mason and guest lodger, which are fairly commonly used to defend Malay supremacy, have also been included where appropriate. Aside from those, and Mahathir's seminal work, there isn't much to go on. <a  title="User:Johnleemk">Johnleemk</a> | <a  title="User talk:Johnleemk">Talk</a> 11:25, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I would normally be fairly reluctant to do so, because that commentary is more of my own inferences based on my reading of the sources, rather than any statements made by the sources themselves. I prefer relying directly on sources for controversial topics like these. I'll see what I can do about it tomorrow, though. There should be a remark somewhere on the lack of public discourse about Malay supremacy, and I suppose it is an accepted fact by all that foreign sources have generally been critical of Malaysian racial policies. Finding a source remarking on the lack of Malay arguments favouring these policies, though, would be a bit harder, I think. <a  title="User:Johnleemk">Johnleemk</a> | <a  title="User talk:Johnleemk">Talk</a> 16:50, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Support</b> — Extremely comprehensive and informative, as well as thoroughly referenced. The length is no issue with me, though I am surprised that it was 27kb longer than this when it started. It seems quite detailed right now, and it's absolutely wonderful the work that's gone into this. Although, to be honest, I'm not an expert on this subject at all, so I might not be able to determine where things could have — or should have — been summarized further. As it stands, I think it's a fantastic article and I honestly don't have any suggestions for improvement for you. It's a political article, which typically will require that it be nuanced and long-winded anyway, so for all I know, the article might be lacking something with the trimming that's been performed. As, once again, I just don't have enough familiarity with the subject to say either way, I'll just say that I appreciate the article's current level of detail, as well as the effort put into addressing concerns others brought up about it being long-winded (27kb is a whole <i>hell of a lot</i> to cut from an article). So, in conclusion: great job with this thing. That's some dedication right there, and a quality article to show for it. <a  title="User:Ryu Kaze">Ryu Kaze</a> 20:52, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Neutral</b> - I like the article, but the length does worry me. I feel someone should try and produce a ruthlessly shortened version in a sandbox somewhere, just to see what might be possible. Another thing is that the lead section doesn't really summarise the article. They is no mention of the early history, for example. And one minor point is that one of the daughter articles (<a href="/wiki/Malaysian_Malaysia.html" title="Malaysian Malaysia">Malaysian_Malaysia</a>) doesn't have a link to <a href="/wiki/Ketuanan_Melayu.html" title="Ketuanan Melayu">Ketuanan Melayu</a>, though it does link to <a href="/wiki/Social_contract_%28Malaysia%29.html" title="Social contract (Malaysia)">social contract (Malaysia)</a>. <a  title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 00:19, 27 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I fixed the latter two concerns (hopefully). The problem with the lead is that much of it was written before the pre-independence sections were fleshed out. <a href="/wiki/Malaysian_Malaysia.html" title="Malaysian Malaysia">Malaysian Malaysia</a> itself had some minor inconsistencies, so I corrected those and added a link to the article. I'm not sure about the sandbox - it's a good idea, but I don't think I'd be the best guy to start it off. I'm quite confident that it would be possible to write a concise 32kb article about the subject, but the problem is that all or most of the detail making the article interesting to read would be gone. The hardest thing to do would be to get it somewhere in the middle - around 60kb or 70kb - because one would have to be very very selective about what detail to include; as I stated earlier, I'm doubtful this could be achieved because of neutrality concerns in a very political and controversial topic. One would either have to include substantial detail, or none at all, making it difficult to further slim down the article to a reasonable size while preserving neutrality and comprehensiveness. Anyone who thinks it's workable is free to take a shot, though; I'd be glad if we could achieve this, as it seems to be the main sticking point. <a  title="User:Johnleemk">Johnleemk</a> | <a  title="User talk:Johnleemk">Talk</a> 05:44, 27 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>Personally, I don't think it's worth trying. The article has already been trimmed drastically, and I'm concerned as to how one who isn't an expert on the subject (as an example of a non-expert for this subject: me) could cut it further without losing something of the comprehensiveness and without compromising neutrality by way of exclusion. If the only expert on the subject in attendance is <i>already</i> concerned about those things, then it's probably not a good sign. <a  title="User:Ryu Kaze">Ryu Kaze</a> 13:28, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Reluctant Oppose</b> I really like JohnLeeMK's work, and if there is a good article on Malaysia somewhere on WP, odds are it's from him. The problem with featuring controversial articles like this is that in order for it to be acceptable to all parties, bloat is pretty much unavoidable, and use of proper summary style pretty much impossible (echoes of the <a href="/wiki/Terri_Schiavo.html" title="Terri Schiavo">Terri Schiavo</a> nominations). As comprehensive as this is, I believe articles like these, resulting from Wikipedians' failure to compromise- do not demonstrate the best of wikipedia. An unreadably long article does not represent the project well at all. <a  title="User:Borisblue">Borisblue</a> 02:48, 1 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I know this isn't my article to defend, but I find it odd — especially since you seem previously familiar with the subject, unlike me — that you'd say that the article's length is required in order for it to meet neutrality requirements (an actual Wikipedia policy), but that this makes it unworthy of being FA on the grounds of a few guidelines (which are flexible, unlike the neutrality policy). Obviously policies have to be met before any of the guidelines. Even so, though, if bloat is required in order to meet the neutrality policy, then the concept of summary style can still be met by simply adding just enough to satisfy all sides. "Proper summary style" doesn't have a description set in stone, after all. It can be different on every article. <a  title="User:Ryu Kaze">Ryu Kaze</a> 03:25, 1 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>The main thing is, I disagree that the article has to be this long to maintain NPOV. Plenty of more controversial topics with a lot more scholarship dedicated to them have been made into readable NPOV wikifeaturedarticles- <a href="/wiki/Katyn_Massacre.html" title="Katyn Massacre">Katyn Massacre</a> for example. So it is wrong to say that we are forced to choose between NPOV and readability. We can have both, and an article that represents the best WP has to offer must have both. As it is, this article fails <a  title="WP:WIAFA">WP:WIAFA</a>, point 4 and is not FA-quality just yet. <a  title="User:Borisblue">Borisblue</a> 23:51, 1 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>I see. I'd taken your comment that "in order for it to be acceptable to all parties, bloat is pretty much unavoidable" to mean that the article needed to be as long as it is to maintain NPOV.

I can only say that I think the article is a great piece of work, meeting NPOV and comprehensiveness as it is right now. <a  title="User:Ryu Kaze">Ryu Kaze</a> 00:07, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>The article currently covers at least 80 years' worth of history. <a href="/wiki/Katyn_massacre.html" title="Katyn massacre">Katyn massacre</a> deals mainly with the prelude to the massacre, the massacre itself, and what happened afterwards - despite this spanning a substantial (~60 years) length of time, the article has a limited scope. The article we are discussing currently has a rather wide scope, as Malay supremacy has been a feature of Malayan/Malaysian politics since the early 20th century. It will inevitably be much longer, even if we scrimp on detail. Also note that the <a href="/wiki/Katyn_massacre.html" title="Katyn massacre">Katyn massacre</a>, due to its very limited scope, does not need to apply summary style, nor does it have many associated articles, unlike <a href="/wiki/Ketuanan_Melayu.html" title="Ketuanan Melayu">Ketuanan Melayu</a>. <a  title="User:Johnleemk">Johnleemk</a> | <a  title="User talk:Johnleemk">Talk</a> 14:17, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

The number of references is now up to 20 (or 34 if you count the footnotes used more than once), and I'll continue working on getting more. As for the weasely words...

<dd>Well, yeah, all the sections <i>could</i> be expanded, but I've made them the length they are to conform with the <a  title="Wikipedia:Article size">article size</a> guidelines. The general guideline is to keep articles at around 32KB, and the main prose of this article is about 37KB, which I think is a reasonable size for a country history article. Preferrably, more detailed info would go into sub-articles like <a href="/wiki/History_of_the_Philippines_%281521-1898%29.html" title="History of the Philippines (1521-1898)">History of the Philippines (1521-1898)</a>.

<li><b>Comment</b> — Good overall, but what is Hewryk's work being used to support? It's included in the references, but with no indication of how or where its information has been referred to. That should be addressed. I'd also suggest dropping the "General" subsection there altogether after you've identifed where Hewryk's work applies in the "Inline" subsection. That particular style is really only necessary when you're using a ton of references to the same work (specifically, different pages from a single work) and have a bibilography (see <a href="/wiki/Ketuanan_Melayu.html" title="Ketuanan Melayu">Ketuanan Melayu</a> for an example). Given how little they're being used in this case, it wouldn't harm anything to simply drop the "General" section, and would prevent any confusion as to whether or not further information from the works had been used without citations being added. <a  title="User:Ryu Kaze">Ryu Kaze</a> 23:17, 28 August 2006 (UTC)

Consider this sentence: "In 1194 Rhys was defeated in battle by Maelgwn and another son, Hywel, who imprisoned him in Nevern castle, though Hywel later released his father." We don't really need to know that Hywel later released Rhys' father. In fact, I'd say we don't even need to know about Hywel or Nevern castle. "In 1194, Maelgwn's forces defeated Rhys and imprisoned him" would suffice. If you like, Rhion, I'll take a stab at editing the lede, but you're probably in a better position than I to judge which information is vital. <a  class="new" title="User:207.7.97.132">207.7.97.132</a> 18:48, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h3><a href="/wiki/Caffeine.html" title="Caffeine">Caffeine</a></h3>
<p>This is the second nomination after the first <a  title="Wikipedia:Featured article candidates/Caffeine">premature nomination</a>. Since that time, I've put a large amount of work into the article, had it <a  title="Wikipedia:Peer review/Caffeine">peer reviewed</a>, and put in even more work. This article is referenced <a  class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;q=wikipedia+caffeine&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">alot</a> by various websites, so I think it's vital to get this article to FA status. – <a  title="User:ClockworkSoul">Clockwork</a><a  title="User talk:ClockworkSoul"><b>Soul</b></a> 05:41, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><s><b>Comment. (points addressed)</b></s> Hi Clockwork<b>Soul</b>. I would like to offer a couple of observations:
<ul>
<li>I think "Mechanism of action" and "metabolism" should share one main heading, as related to pharmacology. They are currently under "Effects", but, as precursors to effects, should probably come before "Effects" in the article.
<ul>
<li>Added a "pharmacolgy" section to enclose "Mechanism of action", "metabolism", and "tolerance/withdrawl". "Effects" is a less technical section, and I think that it serves as a good lead in to the more technical aspects of pharmacology. – <a  title="User:ClockworkSoul">Clockwork</a><a  title="User talk:ClockworkSoul"><b>Soul</b></a> 15:25, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>With all of the popular press about the possible benefits of caffeine, I see very little reference to that research in the article. It focuses mostly on the adversities (although I see some of the "benefits" in the Mechanism section).
<ul>
<li>Most of that is repeats of the same so-so studies, as far as I can tell. I'll see what I can do to make things a bit more balanced. – <a  title="User:ClockworkSoul">Clockwork</a><a  title="User talk:ClockworkSoul"><b>Soul</b></a> 15:25, 20 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Looking this over, I notice that the entire beginning of the "effects" section — two whole paragraphs — is about the positive effects. Is there anything specific that you think should be added? – <a  title="User:ClockworkSoul">Clockwork</a><a  title="User talk:ClockworkSoul"><b>Soul</b></a> 22:19, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Could the "caffeine equivalents" listing be made a note/appendix to the article? It breaks up the flow somewhat.
<ul>
<li>I thought about this a bit... I worked it into a relatively small table and moved it to one side. I'm not entirely happy with it yet, but I think it's an improvement. What do you think? – <a  title="User:ClockworkSoul">Clockwork</a><a  title="User talk:ClockworkSoul"><b>Soul</b></a> 15:25, 20 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Much better! I would move it to somewhere on the right margin though. I'm going to remove line breaks from the chem-box for "other names", to decrease its length. If this violates chem-box rules, please revert.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><b>Comments</b>: I like the article and think it is well done. Some minor suggestions: Make the location of the Point clearer, both by adding that it is in the United States, and by something similar to the wording in <a href="/wiki/Point_State_Park.html" title="Point State Park">Point State Park</a>, i.e. "...located where the confluence of the Allegheny and Monongahela Rivers forms the Ohio River, also known as the Forks of the Ohio" (not sure the Forks part is needed). This should make it clearer to people outside of Pennsylvania and especially outside of the US. I would not refer to Kaufman as an industrialist (he owned department stores - maybe a merchant? department store magnate?). I think the year (1947) could be repeated at the start of the <b>Plans for the megastructure</b> section. Would it help to add a few sentences about how the Point developed afterwards (how / when did it become the park it is today)? Questions I had (it is not necessary to do these for FA, but they could be helpful if they are possible). Are there any newspaper stories from the time that could be cited (more / different refs)? Any old maps showing the Point as it was? Perhaps something here <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://digital.library.pitt.edu/maps/" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> or a detail of this 1940 PennDot map with a Pittsburgh inset showing the rivers, Point and bridges could be used (it would have to be fair use) <a  class="external autonumber" title="ftp://ftp.dot.state.pa.us/public/pdf/BPR_pdf_files/MAPS/Statewide/Historic_OTMs/1940bk.pdf" rel="nofollow">[8]</a> (PDF).

<li>Thanks for your comments. I executed most of your suggestions, although I just linked a useful map rather than incorporating it into the article. I'm not really familiar with how reusable those maps would be and the legitimacy of fair use seems limited (much more so than the images of Wright's plans).</li>
<li>As far as going to primary sources, the two main scholars referenced rely primarily on private letters between the participants and other such documents; since the plans were not really publicized until after they were killed, newspaper coverage was not enormous. Obviously I haven't completely perused the newspaper archives, but I do not expect that there is anything useful to be found in the primary sources that is not better cited to the secondary sources -- the two scholars works, Cleary particularly, are the definitive ones on the topic. <a  title="User:Christopher Parham">Christopher Parham</a> <a  title="User talk:Christopher Parham">(talk)</a> 05:02, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
