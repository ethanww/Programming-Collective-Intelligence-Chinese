</div>
<p>The <b>Parliament Acts</b> are two <a href="/wiki/Act_of_Parliament.html" title="Act of Parliament">Acts</a> of <a href="/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom.html" title="Parliament of the United Kingdom">Parliament</a> of the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom.html" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>, passed in 1911 and 1949 respectively. They form part of the <a href="/wiki/Constitution_of_the_United_Kingdom.html" title="Constitution of the United Kingdom">Constitution of the United Kingdom</a>.</p>
<p>The first Act, the Parliament Act 1911 (1 &amp; 2 Geo. 5. C. 13), limited the powers of the <a href="/wiki/House_of_Lords.html" title="House of Lords">House of Lords</a> to block <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom_House_of_Commons.html" title="United Kingdom House of Commons">House of Commons</a> legislation, asserting the supremacy of the Commons. It also altered the maximum time between general elections to be five instead of seven years (amending the <a href="/wiki/Septennial_Act.html" title="Septennial Act">Septennial Act</a>). The Parliament Act 1911 was amended by the second Act, the Parliament Act 1949 (12, 13 &amp; 14 Geo. 6. C. 103), which reduced the power of the Lords further by cutting the time they could delay bills from two years to one.</p>
<p>The Parliament Acts have been used to pass legislation against the wishes of the Lords on only 7 occasions since 1911, one instance being passing of the Parliament Act 1949. Doubts were raised about the validity of the 1949 Act, and the members of the <a href="/wiki/Countryside_Alliance.html" title="Countryside Alliance">Countryside Alliance</a> took a case to court to challenge the validity of the <a href="/wiki/Hunting_Act_2004.html" title="Hunting Act 2004">Hunting Act 2004</a>. In October 2005, the <a href="/wiki/Judicial_functions_of_the_House_of_Lords.html" title="Judicial functions of the House of Lords">House of Lords</a> dismissed an appeal by the Countryside Alliance, with an unusually large panel of nine law lords holding that the 1949 Act was valid.</p>
<p>(A previous Parliament Act, the <a href="/wiki/Convention_Parliament#Convention_Parliament_of_1660.html" title="Convention Parliament">Parliament Act 1660</a>, was repealed by the <a  class="new" title="Statute Law (Repeals) Act 1969">Statute Law (Repeals) Act 1969</a>.

<dl>
<dd><i>An Act to make provision with respect to the powers of the House of Lords in relation to those of the House of Commons, and to limit the duration of Parliament</i>.</dd>

<h3>Background to the 1911 Act</h3>
<div class="thumb tright">
<div style="width:182px;"><a  class="internal" title="David Lloyd George."><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e8/David_Lloyd_George.jpg/180px-David_Lloyd_George.jpg" alt="David Lloyd George." width="180" height="286" longdesc="/wiki/Image:David_Lloyd_George.jpg" /></a>

<a href="/wiki/David_Lloyd_George.html" title="David Lloyd George">David Lloyd George</a>.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The Act was a reaction to the clash between the <a href="/wiki/Liberal_Party_%28UK%29.html" title="Liberal Party (UK)">Liberal</a> government and the House of Lords, culminating in the so-called "<a href="/wiki/People%27s_Budget.html" title="People's Budget">People's Budget</a>" of the <a href="/wiki/Chancellor_of_the_Exchequer.html" title="Chancellor of the Exchequer">Chancellor of the Exchequer</a> <a href="/wiki/David_Lloyd_George.html" title="David Lloyd George">David Lloyd George</a> in 1909, which proposed the introduction of a <a href="/wiki/Land_tax.html" title="Land tax">land tax</a> based on the ideas of the American <a href="/wiki/Tax.html" title="Tax">tax</a> reformer <a href="/wiki/Henry_George.html" title="Henry George">Henry George</a>. This would have had a major effect on large landowners and the <a href="/wiki/Conservative_Party_%28UK%29.html" title="Conservative Party (UK)">Conservative</a> opposition, which consisted mostly of large landowners, had a large majority in the Lords. Furthermore they believed that money should be raised through the introduction of <a href="/wiki/Tariff.html" title="Tariff">tariffs</a> on <a href="/wiki/Imports.html" title="Imports">imports</a>, thus helping British industry. The Lords voted down the new budget, but the Liberals built on the unpopularity of the Lords to make reducing the power of the Lords an important issue of the <a href="/wiki/UK_general_election.html" title="UK general election">general election</a> in <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election%2C_1910_%28January%29.html" title="United Kingdom general election, 1910 (January)">January 1910</a>.</p>
<p>In the January election the Liberals returned in a hung parliament - his calls for action against the lords having energised believers in hereditary principle while failing to interest the rest of the voting public. Lloyd George tried to pass the budget, but the King was still reluctant and insisted on another <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election%2C_1910_%28December%29.html" title="United Kingdom general election, 1910 (December)">election that year in December</a> before taking action.</p>
<p>The Liberals formed a new minority government that December using a coalition of Labour and Irish MPs following the election, and the Lords subsequently accepted the Budget when the land tax proposal was dropped (it was declared unconstitutional at any rate). However, as a result of the budget dispute, the government introduced the Parliament Bill 1910 to limit the power of the Lords. The Prime Minister, <a href="/wiki/Herbert_Henry_Asquith.html" title="Herbert Henry Asquith">Herbert Henry Asquith</a>, asked <a href="/wiki/Edward_VII_of_the_United_Kingdom.html" title="Edward VII of the United Kingdom">Edward VII</a> to create sufficient new Liberal peers to pass the Bill if the Lords rejected it. The King assented, provided that Asquith went back to the polls to obtain an explicit mandate for the constitutional change.</p>
<p>The Lords voted this 1910 Bill down, so Asquith called a second general election in <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election%2C_1910_%28December%29.html" title="United Kingdom general election, 1910 (December)">December 1910</a>, and again formed a minority government. Edward VII had died in May 1910, but <a href="/wiki/George_V_of_the_United_Kingdom.html" title="George V of the United Kingdom">George V</a> agreed that, if necessary, he would create 250 new Liberal peers to neutralise the Conservative majority in the Lords. The Conservative Lords then backed down, and on <a href="/wiki/August_10.html" title="August 10">10 August</a> <a href="/wiki/1911.html" title="1911">1911</a>, the House of Lords passed the Parliament Act by a narrow 131-114 vote, with the support of some two dozen Conservative peers and eleven of thirteen <a href="/wiki/Lord_Spiritual.html" title="Lord Spiritual">Lords Spiritual</a> (who normally do not vote).</p>
<p>The Parliament Act was intended as a temporary measure: its preamble recites:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>whereas it is intended to substitute for the House of Lords as it at present exists a Second Chamber constituted on a popular instead of hereditary basis, but such substitution cannot be immediately brought into operation</i>.</dd>
</dl>
<p>However, the Liberal government did not follow through with reform of the Lords, and the composition of the Lords remained much the same for another 50 years. <a href="/wiki/Life_peer.html" title="Life peer">Life peers</a> were introduced in the 1960s, and the <a href="/wiki/Labour_Party_%28UK%29.html" title="Labour Party (UK)">Labour</a> government of 1997–2005 took the first steps to reform the Lords, reducing the number of <a href="/wiki/Hereditary_peer.html" title="Hereditary peer">hereditary peers</a> entitled to attend and vote in the Lords, but <a href="/wiki/As_of_2005.html" title="As of 2005">as of 2005</a> the second chamber is still not elected.</p>

<p><a name="Provisions_of_the_1911_Act" id="Provisions_of_the_1911_Act"></a></p>
<h3>Provisions of the 1911 Act</h3>
<p>The 1911 Act stopped the Lords from vetoing any public legislation that originated in and had been approved by the Commons, and restricted their ability to delay such legislation to one month for "<a href="/wiki/Money_bill.html" title="Money bill">money bills</a>" (dealing with <a href="/wiki/Taxation.html" title="Taxation">taxation</a>) and two years for other bills. The <a href="/wiki/Speaker_of_the_British_House_of_Commons.html" title="Speaker of the British House of Commons">Speaker</a> certifies which bills are money bills. If a money bill is not passed by the Lords without amendment within one month after it is received, the bill can be presented for <a href="/wiki/Royal_Assent.html" title="Royal Assent">Royal Assent</a> without being passed by the Lords. For other public bills, the 1911 Act originally provided that a rejected bill would become law without the consent of the Lords, if passed by the Commons in three successive sessions, providing two years elapsed between Second Reading and final passing in the Commons.</p>
<p>The only bill the Lords could veto was one to prolong the lifetime of a <a href="/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom.html" title="Parliament of the United Kingdom">parliament</a>. The Act could only be used to force through a bill originating in the Commons and so the Lords also retained the power to veto any bill that it had itself initiated. In addition to curtailing the power of the Lords the 1911 Act also amended the <a href="/wiki/Septennial_Act_1715.html" title="Septennial Act 1715">Septennial Act 1715</a>, reducing the maximum duration of any parliament from seven years to five, and provided for payment for <a href="/wiki/Member_of_Parliament.html" title="Member of Parliament">MPs</a> (of £400 per year, excluding government ministers).<sup id="_ref-afgh_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[1]</a></sup></p>

<p>The 1911 Act was amended in 1949 by the <a href="/wiki/Labour_Party_%28UK%29.html" title="Labour Party (UK)">Labour</a> government under <a href="/wiki/Clement_Attlee.html" title="Clement Attlee">Clement Attlee</a>, in order to reduce the power of the Lords further by cutting the time they could delay bills from three sessions over two years to two sessions over one year. The government had embarked on a radical programme of <a href="/wiki/Nationalisation.html" title="Nationalisation">nationalisation</a> and was afraid that this would be blocked. The change was introduced as a Bill in 1947, but the Lords attempted to block this change. The Bill was reintroduced in 1948 and 1949 before the 1911 Act was used to force it through. Use of the 1911 Act required a delay over three "sessions", so a special short "session" of parliament was introduced into 1948, with a <a href="/wiki/Speech_from_the_Throne.html" title="Speech from the Throne">King's Speech</a> on <a href="/wiki/September_14.html" title="September 14">14 September</a> <a href="/wiki/1948.html" title="1948">1948</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Prorogation.html" title="Prorogation">prorogation</a> on <a href="/wiki/October_25.html" title="October 25">25 October</a>. In the end, the amended Parliament Act was never used for the intended purposes in the 1940s or 1950s, possibly because the mere threat of it was enough. The <a href="/wiki/Salisbury_convention.html" title="Salisbury convention">Salisbury convention</a> that the Lords would not block government bills that were mentioned in the government's <a href="/wiki/Manifesto.html" title="Manifesto">manifesto</a> dates from this time.</p>

<h2>Use of the Parliament Acts</h2>
<p>The Parliament Acts have been used only a handful of times. The 1911 Act was used in its unamended form only three times between 1911 and 1949:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="/wiki/Welsh_Church_Act_1914.html" title="Welsh Church Act 1914">Welsh Church Act 1914</a>, under which the <a href="/wiki/Wales.html" title="Wales">Welsh</a> part of the <a href="/wiki/Church_of_England.html" title="Church of England">Church of England</a> was <a href="/wiki/Disestablishment.html" title="Disestablishment">disestablished</a> in 1920, becoming the <a href="/wiki/Church_in_Wales.html" title="Church in Wales">Church in Wales</a></li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Home_Rule_Act_1914.html" title="Home Rule Act 1914">Home Rule Act 1914</a>, which would have established a <a href="/wiki/Home_Rule.html" title="Home Rule">Home Rule</a> government in <a href="/wiki/Ireland.html" title="Ireland">Ireland</a>; its implementation was blocked due to the <a href="/wiki/World_War_I.html" title="World War I">First World War</a></li>
<li>Parliament Act 1949, which amended the Parliament Act 1911 (discussed above)</li>
</ol>
<p>The amended form of the 1911 Act has been used four times in recent years. Since <a href="/wiki/Tony_Blair.html" title="Tony Blair">Tony Blair</a>'s Labour government came to power in 1997, there has been repeated speculation that the government would rely on the Parliament Acts to reverse a check from the Lords. In the event, the Parliament Acts were not required to enact, for example, the <a  class="new" title="Criminal Justice (Mode of Trial) (No 2) Bill">Criminal Justice (Mode of Trial) (No 2) Bill</a> in 2000 (which originally proposed to give <a href="/wiki/Magistrate.html" title="Magistrate">magistrates</a>, not defendants, the choice of where an "<a href="/wiki/Either_way.html" title="Either way">either way</a>" offence would be tried). The Parliament Acts cannot be used to force through legislation that originated in the House of Lords, so they could not have been used to enact the <a href="/wiki/Civil_Partnerships_Act_2004.html" title="Civil Partnerships Act 2004">Civil Partnerships Act 2004</a> or the <a href="/wiki/Constitutional_Reform_Act_2005.html" title="Constitutional Reform Act 2005">Constitutional Reform Act 2005</a>.</p>
<p>Legislation has been made under the Parliament Acts on the following occasions:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="/wiki/War_Crimes_Act_1991.html" title="War Crimes Act 1991">War Crimes Act 1991</a>, which extended jurisdiction of UK courts to cover acts committed on behalf of <a href="/wiki/Nazi_Germany.html" title="Nazi Germany">Nazi Germany</a> during the <a href="/wiki/Second_World_War.html" title="Second World War">Second World War</a> (the only time that the Parliament Acts had been used by a <a href="/wiki/Conservative_Party_%28UK%29.html" title="Conservative Party (UK)">Conservative</a> government)</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/European_Parliamentary_Elections_Act_1999.html" title="European Parliamentary Elections Act 1999">European Parliamentary Elections Act 1999</a>, which changed the system of elections to the <a href="/wiki/European_Parliament.html" title="European Parliament">European Parliament</a> from <a href="/wiki/First_past_the_post.html" title="First past the post">first past the post</a> to a form of <a href="/wiki/Proportional_representation.html" title="Proportional representation">proportional representation</a></li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Sexual_Offences_%28Amendment%29_Act_2000.html" title="Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 2000">Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 2000</a>, which equalised the <a href="/wiki/Age_of_consent.html" title="Age of consent">age of consent</a> for male <a href="/wiki/Homosexual.html" title="Homosexual">homosexual</a> sexual activities with that for <a href="/wiki/Heterosexual.html" title="Heterosexual">heterosexual</a> and <a href="/wiki/Lesbian.html" title="Lesbian">lesbian</a> sexual activities at 16.</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Hunting_Act_2004.html" title="Hunting Act 2004">Hunting Act 2004</a>, which prohibited <a href="/wiki/Hare_coursing.html" title="Hare coursing">hare coursing</a> and (subject to some exceptions) all <a href="/wiki/Hunting.html" title="Hunting">hunting</a> of <a  class="new" title="Wild mammal">wild mammals</a> (particularly <a href="/wiki/Fox_hunting.html" title="Fox hunting">foxes</a>) with <a href="/wiki/Dog.html" title="Dog">dogs</a>, taking effect in early 2005.</li>
</ol>
<p>The first three measures were not mentioned in manifestos, and hence in trying to veto them the Lords was not breaking the <a href="/wiki/Salisbury_convention.html" title="Salisbury convention">Salisbury convention</a>. The Hunting Bill was mentioned in the <a href="/wiki/Labour_Party_%28UK%29.html" title="Labour Party (UK)">Labour Party</a> manifesto for the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election%2C_2001.html" title="United Kingdom general election, 2001">2001 general election</a> and depending upon how the wording and the convention are interpreted the attempt to block it could be taken as a breach.</p>
<p>The threat of the Parliament Acts has been employed by British governments on a number of occasions to force the Lords to accept its legislation. In at least three cases, it was possible that the provisions of the Parliament Acts could have been employed, but the legislation was approved by the House of Lords as a result of the government making concessions:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="/wiki/Temperance_%28Scotland%29_Act_1913.html" title="Temperance (Scotland) Act 1913">Temperance (Scotland) Act 1913</a>, which allowed the voters in a district to hold a poll to vote on whether their district went "<a href="/wiki/Prohibition.html" title="Prohibition">dry</a>" or remained "wet"</li>

<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Validity of the 1949 Act">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Validity_of_the_1949_Act" id="Validity_of_the_1949_Act"></a></p>
<h2>Validity of the 1949 Act</h2>
<p>Since the 1949 Act was passed, doubts have been raised by legal <a href="/wiki/Academia.html" title="Academia">academics</a> as to whether the use of the 1911 Act to pass the 1949 Act, amending the 1911 Act itself, was valid. Three main concerns were raised:</p>
<ul>
<li>The restriction on the 1911 Act being used to prolong the life of Parliament would not be entrenched if the 1911 Act could be used to amend itself first.</li>
<li>The 1949 Act could be considered to be <a href="/wiki/Secondary_legislation.html" title="Secondary legislation">secondary legislation</a>, since it depended for its validity on another Act, the 1911 Act, and the principle that courts will respect an Act of Parliament without exploring its origins (as emanation of <a href="/wiki/Parliamentary_sovereignty.html" title="Parliamentary sovereignty">parliamentary sovereignty</a>) would not apply.</li>
<li>Under 1911 Act, Parliament (that is, the Commons and the Lords acting together) delegated its ability to pass legislation to another body (the Commons alone). Following legal principles established when the United Kingdom granted legislative powers to <a href="/wiki/Colonial_government_in_America.html" title="Colonial government in America">assemblies in its colonies</a> in the late 1700s, a subordinate legislative body cannot use the Act under which legislative power was delegated to them to expand their competence without an express power to do so in the enabling Act (see <a href="/wiki/Declaratory_Act.html" title="Declaratory Act">Declaratory Act</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>To address these concerns, a <a href="/wiki/Law_Lord.html" title="Law Lord">Law Lord</a>, <a href="/wiki/Lord_Donaldson_of_Lymington.html" title="Lord Donaldson of Lymington">Lord Donaldson of Lymington</a>, presented a <a href="/wiki/Private_Member%27s_Bill.html" title="Private Member's Bill">Private Member's Bill</a> in <a href="/wiki/House_of_Lords.html" title="House of Lords">House of Lords</a> in the 2000-2001 session of Parliament (the Parliament Acts (Amendment) Bill), which would have had the effect of confirming the legitimacy of the 1949 Act, but prohibiting any further such uses of the Parliament Act to amend itself, or use of it to further modify or curtail the powers of the House of Lords. <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/ld199900/ldbills/126/2000126.htm">[1]</a>. A similar Bill was introduced in the next session also. These Bills did not proceed to a <a href="/wiki/Parliamentary_procedure.html" title="Parliamentary procedure">Third Reading</a>.</p>
<p>The first legal challenge to the 1949 Act is believed to have been made during the first prosecution for <a href="/wiki/War_crimes.html" title="War crimes">war crimes</a> under the War Crimes Act 1991, <i>R. v. Serafinowicz</i>, but this challenge was rejected, and no record of the legal arguments remains <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.hmcourts-service.gov.uk/judgmentsfiles/j3073/the_queen-v-hm_attorney_general.htm">[2]</a>.</p>
<p>After this, the 1949 Act, and the validity of Acts made under it, remained unchallenged until the Parliament Act was used to pass the Hunting Act 2004, when the <a href="/wiki/Countryside_Alliance.html" title="Countryside Alliance">Countryside Alliance</a> challenged the validity of the 1949 Act. In the <a href="/wiki/High_Court_of_England_and_Wales.html" title="High Court of England and Wales">High Court</a> (<a  class="external text" title="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2005/94.html"><i>R. v. H.M. Attorney General, ex parte Jackson</i></a> [2005] EWHC 94 (Admin), <a href="/wiki/January_28.html" title="January 28">28 January</a> <a href="/wiki/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>), the wording of the 1911 Act was held not to imply any entrenchment. Support for this conclusion can be drawn from the parliamentary debates on the 1911 Act, in which an entrenchment clause was considered but rejected, the Government clearly displaying the intention to be able to make such amendments if necessary. However, the 2005 decision was made on other grounds, so the question of whether the Courts could refer to the 1949 Act's Parliamentary debates was not decided.</p>
<p>The 1949 Act was also held to be <a href="/wiki/Primary_legislation.html" title="Primary legislation">primary legislation</a>, but of an unusual sort, since the Courts can rule on whether the provisions of the 1911 Act were complied with. This analysis also applies to the other Acts passed under the Parliament Acts. It was also held that the 1911 Act clearly permits the Parliament Act procedure to be used for "any Public Bill", and this was sufficient to dispose of the argument that the 1911 Act could not be used to amend itself. Effectively, the Court took the view that the 1911 Act was a 'remodelling' of the constitution.</p>
<p>The subsequent <a href="/wiki/Court_of_Appeal_of_England_and_Wales.html" title="Court of Appeal of England and Wales">Court of Appeal</a> ruling (<a  class="external text" title="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2005/126.html"><i>R. v. H.M. Attorney General, ex parte Jackson</i></a> [2005] EWCA Civ 126, <a href="/wiki/February_16.html" title="February 16">16 February</a> <a href="/wiki/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>) agreed that the 1949 Act itself was valid, but left open the question of whether the Commons could use the Parliament Act to make significant changes to the constitution (for example, repealing the Parliament Act's provision prohibiting the Act from being used to extend the lifespan of Parliament). The Court of Appeal refused the Countryside Alliance permission to appeal their decision to the <a href="/wiki/Judicial_functions_of_the_House_of_Lords.html" title="Judicial functions of the House of Lords">House of Lords</a>; however, a petition for permission to appeal was submitted directly to the Law Lords and granted in July 2005. Argument in the case was heard on <a href="/wiki/13_July.html" title="13 July">13</a> and <a href="/wiki/July_14.html" title="July 14">14 July</a> <a href="/wiki/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a> by an unusually large committee of nine law lords (the usual number is five) . In a unanimous decision (<a  class="external text" title="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200506/ldjudgmt/jd051013/jack-1.htm"><i>Jackson v. H.M. Attorney General</i></a>, [2005] UKHL 56, <a href="/wiki/October_13.html" title="October 13">13 October</a> <a href="/wiki/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>), they upheld the validity of 1949 Act.</p>
