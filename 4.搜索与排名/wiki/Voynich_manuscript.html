The Voynich manuscript is written in an unknown <a href="/wiki/Writing_system.html" title="Writing system">script</a>.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The <b>Voynich manuscript</b> is a mysterious <a href="/wiki/Illustration.html" title="Illustration">illustrated</a> <a href="/wiki/Book.html" title="Book">book</a> with incomprehensible contents. It is thought to have been written approximately 400 years ago by an unknown author in an unidentified <a href="/wiki/Writing_system.html" title="Writing system">script</a> and unintelligible <a href="/wiki/Language.html" title="Language">language</a>.</p>
<p>Over its recorded existence, the Voynich manuscript has been the object of intense study by many professional and amateur <a href="/wiki/Cryptographer.html" title="Cryptographer">cryptographers</a>, including some top <a href="/wiki/American.html" title="American">American</a> and <a href="/wiki/British.html" title="British">British</a> <a href="/wiki/Codebreaker.html" title="Codebreaker">codebreakers</a> of <a href="/wiki/World_War_II.html" title="World War II">World War II</a> fame (all of whom failed to decipher a single word). This string of failures has turned the Voynich manuscript into a famous subject of <a href="/wiki/History_of_cryptography.html" title="History of cryptography">historical cryptology</a>, but it has also given weight to the <a href="/wiki/Theory.html" title="Theory">theory</a> that the book is simply an elaborate <a href="/wiki/Hoax.html" title="Hoax">hoax</a> — a meaningless sequence of arbitrary <a href="/wiki/Symbol.html" title="Symbol">symbols</a>.</p>
<p>The book is named after the <a href="/wiki/Polish-American.html" title="Polish-American">Polish-American</a> book-dealer <a href="/wiki/Wilfrid_M._Voynich.html" title="Wilfrid M. Voynich">Wilfrid M. Voynich</a>, who acquired it in <a href="/wiki/1912.html" title="1912">1912</a>.

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>By current estimates, the book originally had 272 pages in 17 <a href="/wiki/Paper_quire.html" title="Paper quire">quires</a> of 16 pages each <sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a  title="">[2]</a></sup>. About 240 <a href="/wiki/Vellum_parchment.html" title="Vellum parchment">vellum</a> pages remain today, and gaps in the page numbering (which seems to be later than the text) indicate that several pages were already missing by the time that Voynich acquired it. A <a href="/wiki/Quill.html" title="Quill">quill pen</a> was used for the text and figure outlines, and colored paint was applied (somewhat crudely) to the figures, possibly at a later date.</p>

<h3>Illustrations</h3>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Illustration.html" title="Illustration">illustrations</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Manuscript.html" title="Manuscript">manuscript</a> shed little light on its contents, but imply that the book consists of six "sections", with different styles and subject matter. Except for the last section, which contains only text, almost every page contains at least one <a href="/wiki/Illustration.html" title="Illustration">illustration</a>. The sections, and their conventional names, are:</p>
<div class="thumb tright">
<div style="width:182px;"><a  class="internal" title="The &quot;herbal&quot; section of the manuscript contains illustrations of plants."><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/e6/F34r.jpg/180px-F34r.jpg" alt="The &quot;herbal&quot; section of the manuscript contains illustrations of plants." width="180" height="271" longdesc="/wiki/Image:F34r.jpg" /></a>

The "herbal" section of the manuscript contains illustrations of plants.</div>
</div>
</div>
<ul>
<li><i><b>Herbal</b></i> — each page displays one <a href="/wiki/Plant.html" title="Plant">plant</a> (sometimes two), and a few paragraphs of text—a format typical of <a href="/wiki/European.html" title="European">European</a> <a href="/wiki/Herbal.html" title="Herbal">herbals</a> of the time. Some parts of these drawings are larger and cleaner copies of sketches seen in the <i>pharmaceutical</i> section (below).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i><b>Astronomical</b></i> — contains circular <a href="/wiki/Diagram.html" title="Diagram">diagrams</a>, some of them with <a href="/wiki/Star_system.html" title="Star system">suns</a>, <a href="/wiki/Natural_satellite.html" title="Natural satellite">moons</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Stars.html" title="Stars">stars</a>, suggestive of <a href="/wiki/Astronomy.html" title="Astronomy">astronomy</a> or <a href="/wiki/Astrology.html" title="Astrology">astrology</a>. One series of 12 diagrams depicts conventional symbols for the <a href="/wiki/Zodiac.html" title="Zodiac">zodiacal</a> <a href="/wiki/Constellation.html" title="Constellation">constellations</a> (two fish for <a href="/wiki/Pisces.html" title="Pisces">Pisces</a>, a bull for <a href="/wiki/Taurus_%28constellation%29.html" title="Taurus (constellation)">Taurus</a>, a soldier with <a href="/wiki/Crossbow.html" title="Crossbow">crossbow</a> for <a href="/wiki/Sagittarius.html" title="Sagittarius">Sagittarius</a>, etc.). Each symbol is surrounded by exactly 30 miniature female figures, most of them naked, each holding a labeled star. The last two pages of this section (<a href="/wiki/Aquarius.html" title="Aquarius">Aquarius</a> and <a href="/wiki/Capricornus.html" title="Capricornus">Capricornus</a>, roughly <a href="/wiki/January.html" title="January">January</a> and <a href="/wiki/February.html" title="February">February</a>) were lost, while <a href="/wiki/Aries.html" title="Aries">Aries</a> and Taurus are split into four paired diagrams with 15 stars each. Some of these diagrams are on fold-out pages.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i><b>Biological</b></i> — a dense continuous text interspersed with figures, mostly showing small nude women bathing in pools or tubs connected by an elaborate network of pipes, some of them clearly shaped like body <a href="/wiki/Organ.html" title="Organ">organs</a>. Some of the women wear crowns.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i><b>Cosmological</b></i> — more circular diagrams, but of an obscure nature. This section also has fold-outs; one of them spans six pages and contains some sort of <a href="/wiki/Map.html" title="Map">map</a> or diagram, with nine "islands" connected by "<a href="/wiki/Causeway.html" title="Causeway">causeways</a>", castles, and possibly a <a href="/wiki/Volcano.html" title="Volcano">volcano</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i><b>Pharmaceutical</b></i> — many labeled drawings of isolated plant parts (<a href="/wiki/Root.html" title="Root">roots</a>, <a href="/wiki/Leaves.html" title="Leaves">leaves</a>, etc.); objects resembling <a href="/wiki/Apothecary.html" title="Apothecary">apothecary</a> jars drawn along the margins; and a few text paragraphs.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i><b>Recipes</b></i> — many short paragraphs, each marked with a flower-like (or star-like) "bullet".</li>
</ul>

<h3>The text</h3>
<div class="thumb tright">
<div style="width:182px;"><a  class="internal" title="The &quot;biological&quot; section of the manuscript has dense text and illustrations showing nude women bathing."><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/79/F75r.jpg/180px-F75r.jpg" alt="The &quot;biological&quot; section of the manuscript has dense text and illustrations showing nude women bathing." width="180" height="252" longdesc="/wiki/Image:F75r.jpg" /></a>
<div class="thumbcaption">
<div class="magnify" style="float:right"><a  class="internal" title="Enlarge"><img src="/skins-1.5/common/images/magnify-clip.png" width="15" height="11" alt="Enlarge" /></a></div>
The "biological" section of the manuscript has dense text and illustrations showing nude women bathing.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The text was clearly written from left to right, with a slightly ragged right margin. Longer sections are broken into paragraphs, sometimes with "<a href="/wiki/Bullet_%28typography%29.html" title="Bullet (typography)">bullets</a>" on the left margin. There is no obvious <a href="/wiki/Punctuation.html" title="Punctuation">punctuation</a>. The <i>ductus</i> (the speed, care, and <a href="/wiki/Cursive.html" title="Cursive">cursiveness</a> with which the letters are written) flows smoothly, as if the <a href="/wiki/Scribe.html" title="Scribe">scribe</a> understood what he was writing when it was written; the manuscript does not give the impression that each character had to be calculated before being put on the page.</p>
<p>The text consists of over 170,000 discrete <a href="/wiki/Glyph.html" title="Glyph">glyphs</a>, usually separated from each other by thin gaps. Most of the glyphs are written with one or two simple pen strokes. While there is some dispute as to whether certain glyphs are distinct or not, an <a href="/wiki/Alphabet.html" title="Alphabet">alphabet</a> with 20-30 glyphs would account for virtually all of the text; the exceptions are a few dozen "weird" characters that occur only once or twice each.</p>
<p>Wider gaps divide the text into about 35,000 "words" of varying length. These seem to follow <a href="/wiki/Phonetic.html" title="Phonetic">phonetic</a> or <a href="/wiki/Orthography.html" title="Orthography">orthographic</a> laws of some sort; <i>e.g.</i> certain characters must appear in each word (like the <a href="/wiki/Vowels.html" title="Vowels">vowels</a> in English), some characters never follow others, some may be doubled but others may not.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Statistics.html" title="Statistics">Statistical analysis</a> of the text reveals patterns similar to natural languages. <sup title="The text in the vicinity of this tag needs citation." class="noprint">[<a  title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><i>citation&#160;needed</i></a>]</sup> For instance, the word frequencies follow <a href="/wiki/Zipf%27s_law.html" title="Zipf's law">Zipf's law</a>, and the word <a href="/wiki/Information_entropy.html" title="Information entropy">entropy</a> (about 10 bits per word) is similar to that of <a href="/wiki/English_language.html" title="English language">English</a> or <a href="/wiki/Latin.html" title="Latin">Latin</a> texts. Some words occur only in certain sections, or in only a few pages; others occur throughout the manuscript. There are very few repetitions among the thousand or so "labels" attached to the illustrations. In the <i>herbal</i> section, the first word on each page occurs only on that page, and may be the name of the <a href="/wiki/Plant.html" title="Plant">plant</a>.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the Voynich manuscript's "language" is quite unlike <a href="/wiki/European_languages.html" title="European languages">European languages</a> in several aspects. For example, there are practically no words with more than ten "letters", yet there are also few one- or two-letter words. The distribution of letters within the word is also rather peculiar: some characters only occur at the beginning of a word, some only at the end, and some always in the middle section – an arrangement found in <a href="/wiki/Arabic_alphabet.html" title="Arabic alphabet">Arabic</a>, but not in the <a href="/wiki/Latin_alphabet.html" title="Latin alphabet">Latin</a>, <a href="/wiki/Greek_alphabet.html" title="Greek alphabet">Greek</a> or <a href="/wiki/Cyrillic_alphabet.html" title="Cyrillic alphabet">Cyrillic alphabets</a>. (It should be noted, though, that the Greek <a href="/wiki/Sigma.html" title="Sigma">sigma</a> or the now-<a href="/wiki/Archaic.html" title="Archaic">archaic</a> Latin <a href="/wiki/Long_s.html" title="Long s">long s</a> have a different form when it appears at the end of words; similarly, English capitalized letters, which usually appear only at the beginning of words, may vary dramatically from their lower-case version.)</p>
<p>The text seems to be more repetitious than typical European languages; there are instances where the same common word appears up to three times in a row. Words that differ only by one letter also repeat with unusual frequency.</p>
<p>There are only a few words in the manuscript written in a seemingly Latin script. In the last page, there are four lines of writing which are written in (rather distorted) Latin letters, except for two words in the main script. The lettering resembles European <a href="/wiki/Alphabet.html" title="Alphabet">alphabets</a> of the <a href="/wiki/15th_Century.html" title="15th Century">15th Century</a>, but the words do not seem to make sense in any language <sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a  title="">[3]</a></sup>. Also, a series of diagrams in the "astronomical" section has the names of ten of the <a href="/wiki/Month.html" title="Month">months</a> (from <a href="/wiki/March.html" title="March">March</a> to <a href="/wiki/December.html" title="December">December</a>) written in Latin script, with spelling suggestive of the <a href="/wiki/Medieval.html" title="Medieval">medieval</a> languages of <a href="/wiki/France.html" title="France">France</a> or the <a href="/wiki/Iberian_Peninsula.html" title="Iberian Peninsula">Iberian Peninsula</a> <sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a  title="">[4]</a></sup>. However, it is not known whether these bits of Latin script were part of the original text, or were added at a later time.</p>

The illustrations in the "biological" section are linked by a network of pipes.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The history of the manuscript is still full of gaps, especially in its earliest part <sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a  title="">[5]</a></sup>. Since the manuscript's alphabet does not resemble any known script, and the text is still undeciphered, the only useful evidence as to the book's age and origin are the illustrations — especially the dress and hairstyles of the human figures, and a couple of castles that are seen in the diagrams. They are all characteristically European, and based on that evidence most experts assign the book to dates between 1450 and 1520. This estimate is supported by other secondary clues.</p>
<p>The earliest confirmed owner of the manuscript was a certain Georg Baresch, an obscure <a href="/wiki/Alchemy.html" title="Alchemy">alchemist</a> who lived in <a href="/wiki/Prague.html" title="Prague">Prague</a> in the early 17th century. Baresch apparently was just as puzzled as we are today about this "<a href="/wiki/Sphinx.html" title="Sphinx">Sphynx</a>" that had been "taking up space uselessly in his library" for many years. On learning that <a href="/wiki/Athanasius_Kircher.html" title="Athanasius Kircher">Athanasius Kircher</a>, a <a href="/wiki/Society_of_Jesus.html" title="Society of Jesus">Jesuit</a> scholar from the <a href="/wiki/Collegio_Romano.html" title="Collegio Romano">Collegio Romano</a>, had published a <a href="/wiki/Coptic_language.html" title="Coptic language">Coptic</a> (<a href="/wiki/Ethiopian.html" title="Ethiopian">Ethiopian</a>) dictionary and "deciphered" the <a href="/wiki/Egyptian_hieroglyph.html" title="Egyptian hieroglyph">Egyptian hieroglyphs</a>, he sent a sample copy of the script to Kircher in <a href="/wiki/Rome.html" title="Rome">Rome</a> (twice), asking for clues. His 1639 letter to Kircher, which was recently located by <a  class="new" title="Rene Zandbergen">Rene Zandbergen</a>, is the earliest mention of the manuscript that has been found so far.</p>
<p>It is not known whether Kircher answered the request, but apparently he was interested enough to try to acquire the book, which Baresch apparently refused to yield. Upon Baresch's death the manuscript passed to his friend <a href="/wiki/Jan_Marek_Marci.html" title="Jan Marek Marci">Jan Marek Marci</a> (Johannes Marcus Marci), then rector of <a href="/wiki/Charles_University.html" title="Charles University">Charles University</a> in Prague; who promptly sent the book to Kircher, his longtime friend and correspondent. Marci's cover letter (1666) is still attached to the manuscript.</p>
<p>There are no records of the book for the next 200 years, but in all likelihood it was kept, with the rest of Kircher's correspondence, in the library of the <a href="/wiki/Collegio_Romano.html" title="Collegio Romano">Collegio Romano</a> (now the <a href="/wiki/Pontifical_Gregorian_University.html" title="Pontifical Gregorian University">Pontifical Gregorian University</a>). It probably remained there until the troops of <a href="/wiki/Victor_Emmanuel_II_of_Italy.html" title="Victor Emmanuel II of Italy">Victor Emmanuel II of Italy</a> captured the city in 1870 and annexed the <a href="/wiki/Papal_States.html" title="Papal States">Papal States</a>. The new Italian government decided to confiscate many properties of the Church, including the library of the Collegio. According to investigations by <a  class="new" title="Xavier Ceccaldi">Xavier Ceccaldi</a> and others, just before this happened many books of the University's library were hastily transferred to the personal libraries of its faculty, which were exempt from confiscation. Kircher's correspondence was among those books—and so apparently was the Voynich manuscript, as it still bears the <a href="/wiki/Ex_libris.html" title="Ex libris">ex libris</a> of <a href="/wiki/Pieter_Beckx.html" title="Pieter Beckx">Petrus Beckx</a>, head of the Jesuit order and the University's Rector at the time.</p>
<p>Beckx's "private" library was moved to the <a href="/wiki/Frascati.html" title="Frascati">Villa Mondragone, Frascati</a>, a large country palace near <a href="/wiki/Rome.html" title="Rome">Rome</a> that had been bought by the <a href="/wiki/Society_of_Jesus.html" title="Society of Jesus">Society of Jesus</a> in 1866 and housed the headquarters of the Jesuits' <a  class="new" title="Collegio Ghisleri">Collegio Ghisleri</a>.</p>
<p>Around 1912 the Collegio Romano was apparently short of money and decided to sell (very discreetly) some of its holdings. Wilfrid Voynich acquired 30 manuscripts, among them the manuscript that now bears his name. In 1930, after his death, the manuscript was inherited by his widow <a href="/wiki/Ethel_Lilian_Voynich.html" title="Ethel Lilian Voynich">Ethel Lilian Voynich</a> (known as the author of the novel <i><a href="/wiki/The_Gadfly.html" title="The Gadfly">The Gadfly</a></i>). She died in 1960 and left the manuscript to her close friend, Miss <a  class="new" title="Anne Nill">Anne Nill</a>. In 1961, Anne Nill sold the book to another antique book dealer Hans P. Kraus. Unable to find a buyer, Kraus donated the manuscript to Yale University in 1969.</p>

<h2>Theories about authorship</h2>
<p>Many names have been proposed as possible authors of the Voynich manuscript. Following are only the most popular ones.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Roger Bacon">edit</a>]</div>

Roger Bacon</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Marci's 1665 cover letter to Kircher says that, according to his late friend <a href="/wiki/Raphael_Sobiehrd-Mnishovsky.html" title="Raphael Sobiehrd-Mnishovsky">Raphael Mnishovsky</a>, the book had once been bought by Emperor <a href="/wiki/Rudolf_II%2C_Holy_Roman_Emperor.html" title="Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor">Rudolf II</a> of <a href="/wiki/Bohemia.html" title="Bohemia">Bohemia</a> (1552–1612) for 600 <a href="/wiki/Ducat.html" title="Ducat">ducats</a> — around <a href="/wiki/Dollar.html" title="Dollar">$30,800</a> <a href="/wiki/As_of_2005.html" title="As of 2005">as of 2005</a>. According to the letter, Rudolf (or perhaps Raphael) believed the author to be the <a href="/wiki/Franciscan.html" title="Franciscan">Franciscan</a> friar and <a href="/wiki/Polymath.html" title="Polymath">polymath</a> <a href="/wiki/Roger_Bacon.html" title="Roger Bacon">Roger Bacon</a> (1214–1294).</p>
<p>Even though Marci said that he was "suspending his judgment" about this claim, it was taken quite seriously by Voynich, who did his best to confirm it. His conviction strongly influenced most decipherment attempts for the next 80 years. However, scholars who have looked at the Voynich manuscript and are familiar with Bacon's works have flatly denied that possibility. One should note also that Raphael died in 1644, and the deal must have occurred before Rudolf's abdication in 1611—at least 55 years before Marci's letter.</p>

John Dee</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The assumption that Roger Bacon was the author led Voynich to conclude that the person who sold the Voynich manuscript to Rudolf could only be <a href="/wiki/John_Dee.html" title="John Dee">John Dee</a>, a mathematician and astrologer at the court of <a href="/wiki/Queen_Elizabeth_I.html" title="Queen Elizabeth I">Queen Elizabeth I</a>, known to have owned a large collection of Bacon's manuscripts. Dee and his <i><a href="/wiki/Scrying.html" title="Scrying">scrier</a></i> (<a href="/wiki/Spirit_medium.html" title="Spirit medium">mediumic assistant</a>) <a href="/wiki/Edward_Kelley.html" title="Edward Kelley">Edward Kelley</a> lived in Bohemia for several years where they had hoped to sell their services to the Emperor. However, Dee's meticulously kept diaries do not mention that sale, and make it seem quite unlikely. Anyway, if the Voynich manuscript author is not Bacon, the connection to Dee may just disappear. On the other hand, Dee himself may have written it and spread the rumour that it was originally a work of Bacon's in the hopes of later selling it.</p>

Edward Kelley</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Dee's companion in Prague, <a href="/wiki/Edward_Kelley.html" title="Edward Kelley">Edward Kelley</a>, was a self-styled alchemist who claimed to be able to turn <a href="/wiki/Copper.html" title="Copper">copper</a> into <a href="/wiki/Gold.html" title="Gold">gold</a> by means of a secret powder which he had dug out of a <a href="/wiki/Bishop.html" title="Bishop">Bishop</a>'s tomb in <a href="/wiki/Wales.html" title="Wales">Wales</a>. As Dee's <i>scrier</i>, he claimed to be able to invoke <a href="/wiki/Angel.html" title="Angel">angels</a> through a crystal ball, and had long conversations with them—which Dee dutifully noted down. The angel's language was called <a href="/wiki/Enochian.html" title="Enochian">Enochian</a>, after <a href="/wiki/Enoch.html" title="Enoch">Enoch</a>, the Biblical father of <a href="/wiki/Methuselah.html" title="Methuselah">Methuselah</a>; according to legend, he had been taken on a tour of Heaven by angels, and later written a <a href="/wiki/Book_of_Enoch.html" title="Book of Enoch">book</a> about what he saw there. Several people (see below) have suggested that, just as Kelley invented Enochian to dupe Dee, he could have fabricated the Voynich manuscript to swindle the Emperor (who was already paying Kelley for his supposed alchemical expertise). However, if Roger Bacon is not the author of the Voynich manuscript, Kelley's connection to the manuscript is just as vacuous as Dee's.</p>

<p><a name="Wilfrid_Voynich" id="Wilfrid_Voynich"></a></p>
<h3>Wilfrid Voynich</h3>
<p>Voynich was often suspected of having fabricated the Voynich manuscript himself. As an antique book dealer, he probably had the necessary knowledge and means; and a "lost book" by Roger Bacon would have been worth a fortune. However, by expert dating of the manuscript, and the recent discovery of Baresch's letter to Kircher, that possibility has been eliminated.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Jacobus Sinapius">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Jacobus_Sinapius" id="Jacobus_Sinapius"></a></p>
<h3>Jacobus Sinapius</h3>
<p>A <a href="/wiki/Photocopying.html" title="Photocopying">photostatic</a> reproduction of the first page of the Voynich manuscript, taken by Voynich sometime before 1921, showed some faint writing that had been erased. With the help of chemicals, the text could be read as the name 'Jacobj `a Tepenece'. This is taken to be Jakub Horcicky of Tepenec, who was also known by his Latin name: <a href="/wiki/Jacobus_Sinapius.html" title="Jacobus Sinapius">Jacobus Sinapius</a>. He was a specialist in <a href="/wiki/Herbal_medicine.html" title="Herbal medicine">herbal medicine</a>, <a href="/wiki/Rudolph_II.html" title="Rudolph II">Rudolph II</a>'s personal physician, and curator of his botanical gardens. Voynich, and many other people after him, concluded from this "signature" that Jacobus owned the Voynich manuscript before Baresch, and saw in that a confirmation of Raphael's story. Others have suggested that Jacobus himself could be the author.</p>
<p>However, that writing does not match Jacobus's signature, as found in a document recently located by <a  class="new" title="Jan Hurich">Jan Hurich</a>. So it is still possible that the writing on page <i>f1r</i> was added by a later owner or librarian, and is only this person's guess as to the book's author. (In the Jesuit history books that were available to Kircher, Jesuit-educated Jacobus is the only alchemist or doctor from Rudolf's court who deserves a full-page entry, while, for example, <a href="/wiki/Tycho_Brahe.html" title="Tycho Brahe">Tycho Brahe</a> is barely mentioned.) Moreover, the chemicals applied by Voynich have so degraded the vellum that hardly a trace of the signature can be seen today; thus there is also the suspicion that the signature was fabricated by Voynich in order to strengthen the Roger Bacon theory.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Jan Marci">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Jan_Marci" id="Jan_Marci"></a></p>
<h3>Jan Marci</h3>
<p><a href="/wiki/Jan_Marek_Marci.html" title="Jan Marek Marci">Jan Marci</a> met Kircher when he led a delegation from Charles University to Rome in 1638; and over the next 27 years, the two scholars exchanged many letters on a variety of scientific subjects. Marci's trip was part of a continuing struggle by the <a href="/wiki/Secularism.html" title="Secularism">secularist</a> side of the University to maintain their independence from the Jesuits, who ran the rival <a href="/wiki/Clementinum.html" title="Clementinum">Clementinum</a> college in Prague. In spite of those efforts, the two universities were merged in 1654, under Jesuit control. It has therefore been speculated that political animosity against the Jesuits led Marci to fabricate Baresch's letters, and later the Voynich manuscript, in an attempt to expose and discredit their "star" Kircher.</p>
<p>Marci's personality and knowledge appear to have been adequate for this task; and Kircher, a "Dr. Know-It-All" who is today remembered more by his egregious mistakes than by his genuine accomplishments, was an easy target. Indeed, Baresch's letter bears some resemblance to a hoax that orientalist <a  class="new" title="Andreas Mueller">Andreas Mueller</a> once played on Kircher. Mueller concocted an unintelligible manuscript and sent it to Kircher with a note explaining that it had come from Egypt. He asked Kircher for a translation, and Kircher, reportedly, produced one at once.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that the only proofs of Georg Baresch's existence are three letters sent to Kircher: one by Baresch (1639), and two by Marci (about a year later). It is also curious that the correspondence between Marci and Kircher ends in 1665, precisely with the Voynich manuscript "cover letter". However, Marci's secret grudge against the Jesuits is pure conjecture: a faithful Catholic, he himself had studied to become a Jesuit, and shortly before his death in 1667 he was granted honorary membership in their Order.</p>

<h3>Raphael Mnishovsky</h3>
<p><a href="/wiki/Raphael_Sobiehrd-Mnishovsky.html" title="Raphael Sobiehrd-Mnishovsky">Raphael Mnishovsky</a>, the friend of Marci who was the reputed source of Bacon's story, was himself a <a href="/wiki/Cryptographer.html" title="Cryptographer">cryptographer</a> (among many other things), and apparently invented a <a href="/wiki/Cipher.html" title="Cipher">cipher</a> which he claimed was uncrackable (ca. 1618). This has led to the theory that he produced the Voynich manuscript as a practical demonstration of his cipher—and made poor Baresch his unwitting "guinea pig". After Kircher published his book on Coptic, Raphael (so the theory goes) may have thought that stumping him would be a much better trophy than stumping Baresch, and convinced the alchemist to ask the Jesuit's help. He would have invented the Roger Bacon story to motivate Baresch. Indeed, the disclaimer in the Voynich manuscript cover letter could mean that Marci suspected a lie. However, there is no definite evidence for this theory.</p>

<h3>Anthony Ascham</h3>
<p>Dr. Leonell Strong, a cancer research scientist and amateur cryptographer, tried to decipher the Voynich manuscript. Strong said that the solution to the Voynich manuscript was a "peculiar double system of arithmetical progressions of a multiple alphabet". Strong claimed that the plaintext revealed the Voynich manuscript to be written by the 16th century English author <a  class="new" title="Anthony Ascham (author)">Anthony Ascham</a>, whose works include <i>A Little Herbal</i>, published in 1550. Although the Voynich manuscript does contain sections resembling an herbal, the main argument against this theory is that it is unknown where Anthony would have obtained such literary and cryptographic knowledge.</p>

<p><a  class="new" title="Prescott Currier">Prescott Currier</a>, a <a href="/wiki/US_Navy.html" title="US Navy">US Navy</a> cryptographer who worked with the manuscript in the 1970s, observed that the pages of the "herbal" section could be separated into two sets, <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>, with distinctive statistical properties and apparently different handwritings. He concluded that the Voynich manuscript was the work of two or more <a href="/wiki/Author.html" title="Author">authors</a> who used different <a href="/wiki/Dialect.html" title="Dialect">dialects</a> or <a href="/wiki/Spelling.html" title="Spelling">spelling</a> conventions, but who shared the same script. However, recent studies have questioned this conclusion. A handwriting expert who examined the book saw only one hand in the whole manuscript. Also, when all sections are examined, one sees a more gradual transition, with herbal <i>A</i> and herbal <i>B</i> at opposite ends. Thus, Prescott's observations could simply be the result of the herbal sections being written in two widely separated time periods.</p>

However, the puzzling details of illustrations have fueled many theories about the book's origins, the contents of its text, and the purpose for which it was intended.

<p><a name="Herbal" id="Herbal"></a></p>
<h3>Herbal</h3>
<p>The first section of the book is almost certainly an <a href="/wiki/Herbal.html" title="Herbal">herbal</a>, but attempts to identify the plants, either with actual specimens or with the stylized drawings of contemporary herbals, have largely failed. Only a couple of plants (including a <a href="/wiki/Viola_tricolor.html" title="Viola tricolor">wild pansy</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Maidenhair_fern.html" title="Maidenhair fern">maidenhair fern</a>) can be identified with some certainty. Those "herbal" pictures that match "pharmacological" sketches appear to be "clean copies" of these, except that missing parts were completed with improbable-looking details. In fact, many of the plants seem to be composite: the roots of one species have been fastened to the leaves of another, with flowers from a third.</p>

<p>Brumbaugh believed that one illustration depicted a New World <a href="/wiki/Helianthus_annuus.html" title="Helianthus annuus">sunflower</a>, which would help date the manuscript and open up intriguing possibilities for its origin. However, the resemblance is slight, especially when compared to the original wild species; and, since the scale of the drawing is not known, the plant could be many other members of the <a href="/wiki/Asteraceae.html" title="Asteraceae">same family</a> — which includes the common <a href="/wiki/Daisy.html" title="Daisy">daisy</a>, <a href="/wiki/German_chamomile.html" title="German chamomile">chamomile</a>, and many other species from all over the world.</p>

However, alchemical books of the period share a common pictorial language, where processes and materials are represented by specific images (eagle, toad, man in tomb, couple in bed, etc.) or standard textual symbols (circle with cross, etc.); and none of these could be convincingly identified in the Voynich manuscript.</p>

Apparently there was a small <a href="/wiki/Cottage_industry.html" title="Cottage industry">cottage industry</a> of such books somewhere in northern Italy, just at the right epoch.

<h2>Theories about the language</h2>
<p>Many theories have been advanced as to the nature of the Voynich manuscript "language". Here is a partial list:</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Letter-based cipher">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Letter-based_cipher" id="Letter-based_cipher"></a></p>
<h3>Letter-based cipher</h3>
<p>According to this theory, the Voynich manuscript contains a meaningful text in some European language, that was intentionally rendered obscure by mapping it to the Voynich manuscript "alphabet" through a <a href="/wiki/Cipher.html" title="Cipher">cipher</a> of some sort—an <a href="/wiki/Algorithm.html" title="Algorithm">algorithm</a> that operated on individual letters.</p>
<p>This has been the working hypothesis for most decipherment attempts in the twentieth century, including an informal team of <a href="/wiki/NSA.html" title="NSA">NSA</a> <a href="/wiki/Cryptographer.html" title="Cryptographer">cryptographers</a> led by <a href="/wiki/William_F._Friedman.html" title="William F. Friedman">William F. Friedman</a> in the early 1950s. Simple <a href="/wiki/Substitution_cipher.html" title="Substitution cipher">substitution ciphers</a> can be excluded, because they are very easy to crack; so decipherment efforts have generally focused on <a href="/wiki/Polyalphabetic_cipher.html" title="Polyalphabetic cipher">polyalphabetic ciphers</a>, invented by <a href="/wiki/Leone_Battista_Alberti.html" title="Leone Battista Alberti">Alberti</a> in the 1460s. This class includes the popular <a href="/wiki/Vigenere_cipher.html" title="Vigenere cipher">Vigenere cipher</a>, which could have been strengthened by the use of nulls and/or equivalent symbols, letter rearrangement, false word breaks, etc. Some people assumed that vowels had been deleted before encryption. There have been several claims of decipherment along these lines, but none has been widely accepted — chiefly because the proposed decipherment algorithms depended on so many guesses by the user that they could extract a meaningful text from any random string of symbols.</p>
<p>The main argument for this theory is that the use of a weird alphabet by a European author can hardly be explained except as an attempt to hide information. Indeed, Roger Bacon knew about ciphers, and the estimated date for the manuscript roughly coincides with the birth of <a href="/wiki/Cryptography.html" title="Cryptography">cryptography</a> as a systematic discipline. Against this theory is the observation that a polyalphabetic cipher would normally destroy the "natural" statistical features that are seen in the Voynich manuscript, such as <a href="/wiki/Zipf%27s_law.html" title="Zipf's law">Zipf's law</a>. Also, although polyalphabetic ciphers were invented about 1467, variants only became popular in the sixteenth century, somewhat too late for the estimated date of the Voynich manuscript.</p>

<h3>Codebook cipher</h3>
<p>According to this theory, the Voynich manuscript "words" would be actually <a href="/wiki/Code_%28cryptography%29.html" title="Code (cryptography)">codes</a> to be looked up in a <i>dictionary</i> or <a href="/wiki/Codebook.html" title="Codebook">codebook</a>. The main evidence for this theory is that the internal structure and length distribution of those words are similar to those of <a href="/wiki/Roman_numeral.html" title="Roman numeral">Roman numerals</a>—which, at the time, would be a natural choice for the codes. However, book-based ciphers are viable only for short messages, because they are very cumbersome to write and to read.</p>

<h3>Visual cipher</h3>
<p>James Finn proposed in his book <i>Pandora's Hope</i> (2004)<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a  title="">[6]</a></sup> that the Voynich manuscript is in fact visually encoded <a href="/wiki/Hebrew_language.html" title="Hebrew language">Hebrew</a>. Once the Voynich letters have been correctly transcribed, using the <a href="/wiki/European_Voynich_Alphabet.html" title="European Voynich Alphabet">EVA</a> as a guide, many of the Voynich words can be seen as Hebrew words that repeat with different distortions to confuse the reader. For example, the word AIN from the manuscript is the Hebrew word for "eye", and it also appears in different distorted versions as "aiin" or "aiiin", to make it appear as though the words are different when in fact they are the same word. Other methods of visual encryption are used as well. The main argument for this view is that it would explain the lack of success that most other researchers have had in decoding the manuscript, because they are based on more mathematical approaches to the decryption. The main argument against it is that such a qualitative encoding places a heavy burden on the talents of the individual decoder, given the multiplicity of possible alternate visual interpretations of the same text. It would be hard to separate how much interpretation is of the genuine text, and how much simply reflects the bias of the original interpreter.</p>

<h3>Micrography</h3>
<p>Following its 1912 rediscovery, one of the earliest efforts to unlock the book's secrets (and, indeed, the first of many premature claims of decipherment) was made in 1921 by William Newbold of the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Pennsylvania.html" title="University of Pennsylvania">University of Pennsylvania</a>. His singular hypothesis held that the visible text is meaningless itself, but that each apparent "letter" is in fact constructed of a series of tiny markings only discernible under <a href="/wiki/Magnification.html" title="Magnification">magnification</a>. These markings, based on <a href="/wiki/Ancient_Greece.html" title="Ancient Greece">ancient Greek</a> <a href="/wiki/Shorthand.html" title="Shorthand">shorthand</a>, were supposed to form a second level of script that held the real content of the writing. Using this knowledge, Newbold claimed to have worked out entire paragraphs proving the authorship of Bacon and recording his use of a compound microscope four hundred years before <a href="/wiki/Leeuwenhoek.html" title="Leeuwenhoek">Leeuwenhoek</a>. However, John Manly of the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Chicago.html" title="University of Chicago">University of Chicago</a> pointed out serious flaws in this theory. Each shorthand character was assumed to have multiple interpretations, with no reliable way to determine which was intended for any given case. Newbold's method also required rearranging letters at will until intelligible <a href="/wiki/Latin_language.html" title="Latin language">Latin</a> was produced. These factors alone ensure the system enough flexibility that nearly anything at all could be "read" in the <a href="/wiki/Microscopic.html" title="Microscopic">microscopic</a> markings, which in any case are themselves illusory. Although there is a tradition of <a href="/wiki/Hebrew_language.html" title="Hebrew language">Hebrew</a> <a href="/wiki/Micrography.html" title="Micrography">micrography</a>, it is nowhere near as compact or complex as the shapes Newbold made out. Upon close study, these turn out to be mere artifacts of the way ink cracks as it dries on rough vellum, and an example of <a href="/wiki/Pareidolia.html" title="Pareidolia">pareidolia</a>. Thanks to Manly's thorough refutation, the micrography theory is today disregarded.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Steganography">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Steganography" id="Steganography"></a></p>
<h3>Steganography</h3>
<p>This theory holds that the text of the Voynich manuscript is mostly meaningless, but contains meaningful information hidden in inconspicuous details—e.g. the second letter of every word, or the number of letters in each line. This technique, called <a href="/wiki/Steganography.html" title="Steganography">steganography</a>, is very old, and was described by <a href="/wiki/Johannes_Trithemius.html" title="Johannes Trithemius">Johannes Trithemius</a> in 1499. Some people suggested that the plain text was to be extracted by a <a href="/wiki/Cardan_grille.html" title="Cardan grille">Cardan grille</a> of some sort. This theory is hard to prove or disprove, since <a href="/wiki/Stegotext.html" title="Stegotext">stegotexts</a> can be arbitrarily hard to crack. An argument against it is that using a cipher-looking cover text defeats the main purpose of steganography, which is to hide the very <i>existence</i> of the secret message.</p>
<p>Some people have suggested that the meaningful text could be encoded in the length or shape of certain pen strokes. There are indeed examples of steganography from about that time that use letter shape (<a href="/wiki/Emphasis_%28typography%29.html" title="Emphasis (typography)">italic</a> vs. upright) to hide information. However, when examined at high magnification, the Voynich manuscript pen strokes seem quite natural, and substantially affected by the uneven surface of the vellum.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Exotic natural language">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Exotic_natural_language" id="Exotic_natural_language"></a></p>
<h3>Exotic natural language</h3>
<p>The linguist <a  class="new" title="Jacques Guy">Jacques Guy</a> once suggested that the Voynich manuscript text could be some exotic natural language, written <a href="/wiki/Plaintext.html" title="Plaintext">in the plain</a> with an invented alphabet. The word structure is indeed similar to that of many language families of East and Central Asia, mainly <a href="/wiki/Sino-Tibetan_languages.html" title="Sino-Tibetan languages">Sino-Tibetan</a> (<a href="/wiki/Chinese_language.html" title="Chinese language">Chinese</a>, <a href="/wiki/Tibetan_language.html" title="Tibetan language">Tibetan</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Burmese_language.html" title="Burmese language">Burmese</a>), <a href="/wiki/Austroasiatic_languages.html" title="Austroasiatic languages">Austroasiatic</a> (<a href="/wiki/Vietnamese_language.html" title="Vietnamese language">Vietnamese</a>, <a href="/wiki/Khmer_language.html" title="Khmer language">Khmer</a>, etc.) and possibly <a href="/wiki/Tai_languages.html" title="Tai languages">Tai</a> (<a href="/wiki/Thai_language.html" title="Thai language">Thai</a>, <a href="/wiki/Lao_language.html" title="Lao language">Lao</a>, etc.). In many of these languages, the "<a href="/wiki/Word_%28linguistics%29.html" title="Word (linguistics)">words</a>" have only one <a href="/wiki/Syllable.html" title="Syllable">syllable</a>; and syllables have a rather rich structure, including <a href="/wiki/Tonal_language.html" title="Tonal language">tonal patterns</a>.</p>
<p>This theory has some historical plausibility. While those languages generally had native scripts, these were notoriously difficult for Western visitors; which motivated the invention of several <a href="/wiki/Phonetic.html" title="Phonetic">phonetic</a> scripts, mostly with <a href="/wiki/Romanization.html" title="Romanization">Latin letters</a> but sometimes with invented alphabets. Although the known examples are much later than the Voynich manuscript, history records hundreds of explorers and missionaries who could have done it—even before <a href="/wiki/Marco_Polo.html" title="Marco Polo">Marco Polo</a>'s thirteenth century voyage, but especially after <a href="/wiki/Vasco_da_Gama.html" title="Vasco da Gama">Vasco da Gama</a> discovered the sea route to the Orient in 1499. The Voynich manuscript author could also be a native from East Asia living in Europe, or educated at a European mission.</p>
<p>The main argument for this theory is that it is consistent with all statistical properties of the Voynich manuscript text which have been tested so far, including doubled and tripled words (which have been found to occur in Chinese and Vietnamese texts at roughly the same frequency as in the Voynich manuscript). It also explains the apparent lack of numerals and Western syntactic features (such as <a href="/wiki/Article_%28grammar%29.html" title="Article (grammar)">articles</a> and <a href="/wiki/Copula.html" title="Copula">copulas</a>), and the general inscrutability of the illustrations. Another possible hint are two large red symbols on the first page, which have been compared to a Chinese-style book title, upside down and badly copied. Also, the apparent division of the year into 360 degrees (rather than 365 days), in groups of 15 and starting with Pisces, are features of the <a href="/wiki/Chinese_calendar.html" title="Chinese calendar">Chinese agricultural calendar</a> (<i>jie q`i</i>). The main argument against the theory is the fact that no one (including scholars at the <a href="/wiki/Chinese_Academy_of_Sciences.html" title="Chinese Academy of Sciences">Academy of Sciences</a> in <a href="/wiki/Beijing.html" title="Beijing">Beijing</a>) could find any clear examples of Asian symbolism or Asian science in the illustrations.</p>
<p>In late 2003, <a  class="new" title="Zbigniew Banasik">Zbigniew Banasik</a> of Poland proposed that the manuscript is plaintext written in the <a href="/wiki/Manchu_language.html" title="Manchu language">Manchu language</a> and gave an incomplete translation of the first page of the manuscript <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.voynich.net/Arch/2004/05/msg00187.html">[3]</a> <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.voynich.net/Arch/2004/05/msg00195.html">[4]</a>.</p>

<p><a name="Polyglot_tongue" id="Polyglot_tongue"></a></p>
<h3>Polyglot tongue</h3>
<p>In his book <i>Solution of the Voynich Manuscript: A liturgical Manual for the Endura Rite of the Cathari Heresy, the Cult of Isis</i> (1987), <a  class="new" title="Leo Levitov">Leo Levitov</a> declared the manuscript a <a href="/wiki/Plaintext.html" title="Plaintext">plaintext</a> transcription of a "polyglot oral tongue". This he defined as "a literary language which would be understandable to people who did not understand Latin and to whom this language could be read." His proposed decryption has three Voynich letters making a syllable, to produce a series of syllables that form a mixture of medieval <a href="/wiki/Flemish_language.html" title="Flemish language">Flemish</a> with many borrowed <a href="/wiki/Old_French.html" title="Old French">Old French</a> and <a href="/wiki/Old_High_German.html" title="Old High German">Old High German</a> words.</p>
<p>According to Levitov, the rite of Endura was none other than the assisted suicide ritual for people already believed to be near death, famously associated with the <a href="/wiki/Cathar.html" title="Cathar">Cathar</a> faith (although the reality of this ritual is also in question). He explains that the chimerical plants are not meant to represent any species of flora, but are secret symbols of the faith. The women in the basins with elaborate plumbing represent the suicide ritual itself, which he believed involved venesection: the cutting of a vein to allow the blood to drain into a warm bath. The constellations with no celestial analogue are representative of the stars in Isis' mantle.</p>
<p>This theory is questioned on several grounds. First, the Cathar faith is widely understood to have been a Christian <a href="/wiki/Gnosticism.html" title="Gnosticism">gnosticism</a>, and not in any way associated with <a href="/wiki/Isis.html" title="Isis">Isis</a>. Second, this theory places the book's origins in the twelfth or thirteenth century, which is considerably older than even the adherents to the Roger Bacon theory believe. Third, the Endura ritual involved fasting, not venesection. Levitov offered no evidence beyond his translation for this theory.</p>

<p><a name="Constructed_language" id="Constructed_language"></a></p>
<h3>Constructed language</h3>
<p>The peculiar internal structure of Voynich manuscript "words" has led William F. Friedman and <a href="/wiki/John_Tiltman.html" title="John Tiltman">John Tiltman</a> to arrive independently at the conjecture that the text could be a <a href="/wiki/Constructed_language.html" title="Constructed language">constructed language</a> in the plain—specifically, a <i>philosophical</i> one. In languages of this class, the vocabulary is organized according to a <a  class="new" title="Category system">category system</a>, so that the general meaning of a word can be deduced from its sequence of letters. For example, in the modern constructed language <a href="/wiki/Ro.html" title="Ro">Ro</a>, <i>bofo-</i> is the category of colors, and any word beginning with those letters would name a color: so <i>red</i> is <i>bofoc</i>, and <i>yellow</i> is <i>bofof</i>. (This is an extreme version of the <a href="/wiki/Library_of_Congress_Classification.html" title="Library of Congress Classification">book classification scheme</a> used by many libraries — in which, say, <i>P</i> stands for <i>language and literature</i>, <i>PA</i> for <a href="/wiki/Greek_language.html" title="Greek language">Greek</a> and <a href="/wiki/Latin.html" title="Latin">Latin</a>, <i>PC</i> for <a href="/wiki/Romance_languages.html" title="Romance languages">Romance languages</a>, etc.)</p>
<p>This concept is quite old, as attested by <a href="/wiki/John_Wilkins.html" title="John Wilkins">John Wilkins</a>'s <i><a href="/wiki/An_Essay_towards_a_Real_Character_and_a_Philosophical_Language.html" title="An Essay towards a Real Character and a Philosophical Language">Philosophical Language</a></i> (1668), but still postdates the generally accepted origin of the VM by two centuries. In most known examples, categories are subdivided by adding <a href="/wiki/Suffix.html" title="Suffix">suffixes</a>; as a consequence, a text in a particular subject would have many words with similar prefixes — for example, all plant names would begin with the similar letters, and likewise for all diseases, etc. This feature could then explain the repetitious nature of the Voynich text. However, no one has been able yet to assign a plausible meaning to any prefix or suffix in the Voynich manuscript.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Hoax">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Hoax" id="Hoax"></a></p>
<h3>Hoax</h3>
<p>The bizarre features of the Voynich manuscript text (such as the doubled and tripled words), the suspicious contents of its illustrations (such as the chimeric plants), its lack of historical reference and persistent resistance to deciphering have led many people to conclude that the manuscript may be a <a href="/wiki/Hoax.html" title="Hoax">hoax</a>.</p>
<p>In 2003, computer scientist <a href="/wiki/Gordon_Rugg.html" title="Gordon Rugg">Gordon Rugg</a> showed that text with characteristics similar to the Voynich manuscript could have been produced using a table of word prefixes, stems, and suffixes, which would have been selected and combined by means of a perforated paper overlay. The latter device, known as a <a href="/wiki/Cardan_grille.html" title="Cardan grille">Cardan grille</a>, was invented around 1550 as an encryption tool, slightly after but contemporary to the estimated creation of the Voynich manuscript. Some maintain that since the pseudo-texts generated in Gordon Rugg's experiments do not have the precise words and frequencies as the Voynich manuscript, its resemblance to "Voynichese" is superficial.</p>
<p>The argument for authenticity is generally that the manuscript is simply too sophisticated to be a simple hoax. As mentioned, many serious linguists and historians have found much of the manuscript to be very complex and thought-provoking. Hoaxes, especially from this era, tend to be sloppy and crude. If the manuscript is a hoax, it is still a very elaborate one, and the question of why it was created remains just as unclear. Language scholars have noted that the manuscript shares certain word statistics (<a href="/wiki/Zipf%27s_law.html" title="Zipf's law">Zipf's law</a>) with natural languages that random text generally lacks. On the other hand, some research indicates that random text demonstrates such features as well.<a  class="external autonumber" title="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=165464">[5]</a> As even <a href="/wiki/Gordon_Rugg.html" title="Gordon Rugg">Rugg</a> admits, the ability to hoax Voynich with early techniques does not necessarily imply that Voynich itself is a hoax. Neither is it impossible, even if unlikely, for random text to share some statistical similarity to natural languages. So neither position can be considered wholly dispositive.</p>

<p><a name="Glossolalia" id="Glossolalia"></a></p>
<h3>Glossolalia</h3>
<p>In their book, Kennedy and Churchill hint to the possibility that the Voynich manuscript may be a case of <a href="/wiki/Glossolalia.html" title="Glossolalia">glossolalia</a>, <a href="/wiki/Channeling.html" title="Channeling">channeling</a> or <a href="/wiki/Outsider_art.html" title="Outsider art">outsider art</a>.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a  title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>If this is true, then the author felt compelled to write large amounts of text in a manner which somehow resembles <a href="/wiki/Stream_of_consciousness.html" title="Stream of consciousness">stream of consciousness</a>, either due to "voices" heard, or due to his own urge. While in glossolalia this often takes place in an invented language (usually made up of fragments of the author's own language), invented scripts for this purpose are rare. Kennedy and Churchill use <a href="/wiki/Hildegard_von_Bingen.html" title="Hildegard von Bingen">Hildegard von Bingens</a> works to point out similarities between the illustrations she drew when she was suffering from severe bouts of <a href="/wiki/Migraine.html" title="Migraine">migraine</a>, and show parallels to the illustrations in the manuscript, namely the "streams of stars" found throughout, and the repetetive nature of the "nymphs" in the balneological section.</p>
<p>The theory is virtually impossible to prove or disprove, short of deciphering the text; Kennedy and Churchill are themselves not convinced of the hypothesis, but consider it plausible. One of the drawbacks of this theory is that it fails to explain the deliberate structure of the manuscript and the carefully crafted astrological and botanical sections.</p>

<p>A number of items in popular culture appear to have been influenced, at least in part, by the Voynich manuscript.</p>
<ul>
<li>The dangerous <a href="/wiki/Grimoire.html" title="Grimoire">grimoire</a> called the <i><a href="/wiki/Necronomicon.html" title="Necronomicon">Necronomicon</a></i> appears in <a href="/wiki/H._P._Lovecraft.html" title="H.

While Lovecraft likely created the <i>Necronomicon</i> without knowledge of the Voynich manuscript, <a href="/wiki/Colin_Wilson.html" title="Colin Wilson">Colin Wilson</a> published a short story in 1969 called "The Return of the Lloigor", in Arkham House's <i>Tales of the Cthulhu Mythos</i>, wherein a character discovers that the Voynich manuscript is an incomplete copy of the grimoire. Since then, the fictional <i>Necronomicon</i> has been repeatedly identified with this real mystery by other authors.</li>
<li>The Voynich manuscript is central to the plot of <a href="/wiki/Brad_Strickland.html" title="Brad Strickland">Brad Strickland</a>’s <i>The Wrath of the Grinning Ghost</i>, part of the Johnny Dixon series begun by author <a href="/wiki/John_Bellairs.html" title="John Bellairs">John Bellairs</a>. A manuscript markedly similar to the Voynich is also central in Bellairs' novel <i>The Face In the Frost</i>, where it can only be deciphered by means of obsessive concentration. (The novel also features a character named for Roger Bacon.)</li>
<li>The <i><a href="/wiki/Codex_Seraphinianus.html" title="Codex Seraphinianus">Codex Seraphinianus</a></i> is a modern work of art created in the style of the Voynich manuscript.</li>
<li>The contemporary composer <a href="/wiki/Hanspeter_Kyburz.html" title="Hanspeter Kyburz">Hanspeter Kyburz</a> wrote an orchestra piece based on the Voynich manuscript, thus reading it as a musical score.</li>
<li>The plot of <i>Il Romanzo di Nostradamus</i> by <a href="/wiki/Valerio_Evangelisti.html" title="Valerio Evangelisti">Valerio Evangelisti</a> features the Voynich manuscript as a work of black magic, against which the famous French astrologer <a href="/wiki/Nostradamus.html" title="Nostradamus">Nostradamus</a> will fight all his life.</li>
<li>In the <a href="/wiki/Computer_game.html" title="Computer game">computer game</a> <i><a  title="Broken Sword: The Sleeping Dragon">Broken Sword: The Sleeping Dragon</a></i>, the Voynich manuscript is the center of a plot involving "Neo-<a href="/wiki/Templar.html" title="Templar">Templars</a>".
