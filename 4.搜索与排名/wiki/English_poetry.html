Many regard William Shakespeare as the greatest English poet.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The history of <b>English poetry</b> stretches from the middle of the 7th century to the present day. Over this period, English <a href="/wiki/Poets.html" title="Poets">poets</a> have written some of the most enduring poems in <a href="/wiki/European.html" title="European">European</a> <a href="/wiki/Culture.html" title="Culture">culture</a>, and the language and its poetry have spread around the globe. Consequently, the term <i>English poetry</i> is unavoidably ambiguous. It can mean poetry written in <a href="/wiki/England.html" title="England">England</a>, or poetry written in the <a href="/wiki/English_language.html" title="English language">English language</a>.</p>
<p>The oldest poetry written in the area currently known as England was composed in <a href="/wiki/Old_English_language.html" title="Old English language">Old English</a>, a precursor to the English language that is not something a typical modern English-speaker could be expected to be able to read. In addition, there was a tradition of English poets writing also in <a href="/wiki/Latin.html" title="Latin">Latin</a> and classical <a href="/wiki/Greek_%28language%29.html" title="Greek (language)">Greek</a>. Today's multicultural English society is likely to produce some interesting poetry written in a wide range of other languages, although such poetries are proving slow to emerge.</p>
<p>With the growth of <a href="/wiki/Trade.html" title="Trade">trade</a> and the British Empire, the English language had been widely used outside England. In the twenty-first century, only a small percentage of the world's native English speakers live in England, and there is also a vast population of non-native speakers of English who are capable of writing poetry in the language. A number of major national poetries, including the <a href="/wiki/Poetry_of_the_United_States.html" title="Poetry of the United States">American</a>, <a href="/wiki/Australian_poetry.html" title="Australian poetry">Australian</a>, <a  class="new" title="New Zealand poetry">New Zealand</a> and <a href="/wiki/Canadian_poetry.html" title="Canadian poetry">Canadian</a> poetry have emerged and developed. Since 1922, <a href="/wiki/Irish_poetry.html" title="Irish poetry">Irish poetry</a> has also been increasingly viewed as a separate area of study.</p>
<p>This article focuses on poetry written in English by poets born or spending a significant part of their lives in England. However, given the nature of the subject, this guideline has been applied with common sense, and reference is made to poetry in other languages or poets who are not primarily English where appropriate.</p>

The first page of Beowulf</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The earliest known English poem is a hymn on the creation; <a href="/wiki/Bede.html" title="Bede">Bede</a> attributes this to <a href="/wiki/C%C3%A6dmon.html" title="Cædmon">Cædmon</a> (fl. 658–680), who was, according to legend, an illiterate herdsman who produced extemporaneous poetry at a monastery at <a href="/wiki/Whitby.html" title="Whitby">Whitby</a>. This is generally taken as marking the beginning of <a href="/wiki/Old_English_poetry.html" title="Old English poetry">Anglo-Saxon</a> poetry.</p>
<p>Much of the poetry of the period is difficult to date, or even to arrange chronologically; for example, estimates for the date of the great epic <i><a href="/wiki/Beowulf.html" title="Beowulf">Beowulf</a></i> range from AD 608 right through to AD 1000, and there has never been anything even approaching a consensus. It is possible to identify certain key moments, however. <i><a href="/wiki/Dream_of_the_Rood.html" title="Dream of the Rood">The Dream of the Rood</a></i> was written before circa AD 700, when excerpts were carved in runes on the <a href="/wiki/Ruthwell_Cross.html" title="Ruthwell Cross">Ruthwell Cross</a>. The works signed by the poet <a href="/wiki/Cynewulf.html" title="Cynewulf">Cynewulf</a>, namely <i><a href="/wiki/Crist.html" title="Crist">Christ</a> II</i>, <i>Elene</i>, <i>The Fates of the Apostles</i>, and <i>Juliana</i>, have been assigned with reasonable certainty to the eighth century. Some poems on historical events, such as <i><a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Brunanburh.html" title="Battle of Brunanburh">The Battle of Brunanburh</a></i> (937) and the <i><a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Maldon.html" title="Battle of Maldon">Battle of Maldon</a></i> (991), appear to have been composed shortly after the events in question, and can be dated reasonably precisely in consequence.</p>
<p>By and large, however, Anglo-Saxon poetry is categorised by the manuscripts in which it survives, rather than its date of composition. The most important manuscripts are the four great poetical codices of the late tenth and early eleventh centuries, known as the <a href="/wiki/Caedmon_manuscript.html" title="Caedmon manuscript">Caedmon manuscript</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Vercelli_Book.html" title="Vercelli Book">Vercelli Book</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Exeter_Book.html" title="Exeter Book">Exeter Book</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/Nowell_Codex.html" title="Nowell Codex">Beowulf manuscript</a>.</p>
<p>While the poetry that has survived is limited in volume, it is wide in breadth. <i>Beowulf</i> is the only heroic epic to have survived in its entirety, but fragments of others such as <a href="/wiki/Waldere.html" title="Waldere">Waldere</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Finnsburg_Fragment.html" title="Finnsburg Fragment">Finnsburg Fragment</a> show that it was not unique in its time. Other genres include much religious verse, from devotional works to biblical paraphrase; elegies such as <i><a href="/wiki/Wanderer_%28poem%29.html" title="Wanderer (poem)">The Wanderer</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Seafarer_%28poem%29.html" title="Seafarer (poem)">The Seafarer</a></i>, and <i><a href="/wiki/The_Ruin.html" title="The Ruin">The Ruin</a></i> (often taken to be a description of the ruins of <a href="/wiki/Bath.html" title="Bath">Bath</a>); and numerous proverbs, <a href="/wiki/Riddles.html" title="Riddles">riddles</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Charm.html" title="Charm">charms</a>.</p>
<p>With one notable exception (the aptly-named <a href="/wiki/The_Rhyming_Poem.html" title="The Rhyming Poem">Rhyming Poem</a>), Anglo-Saxon poetry is written in a form of <a href="/wiki/Alliterative_verse.html" title="Alliterative verse">alliterative verse</a>.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: The Anglo-Norman period and the Later Middle Ages">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="The_Anglo-Norman_period_and_the_Later_Middle_Ages" id="The_Anglo-Norman_period_and_the_Later_Middle_Ages"></a></p>
<h2>The Anglo-Norman period and the Later Middle Ages</h2>
<p>With the <a href="/wiki/Norman_conquest.html" title="Norman conquest">Norman conquest</a> of England, beginning in 1066, the Anglo-Saxon language immediately lost its status; the new aristocracy spoke French, and this became the standard language of courts, parliament, and polite society. As the invaders integrated, their language and that of the natives mingled: the French dialect of the upper classes became <a href="/wiki/Anglo-Norman_language.html" title="Anglo-Norman language">Anglo-Norman</a>, and Anglo-Saxon underwent a gradual transition into <a href="/wiki/Middle_English.html" title="Middle English">Middle English</a>.</p>
<p>While Anglo-Norman was thus preferred for high culture, English literature by no means died out, and a number of important works illustrate the development of the language. Around the turn of the thirteenth century, <a href="/wiki/Layamon.html" title="Layamon">Layamon</a> wrote his <i>Brut</i>, based on Wace's twelfth century Anglo-Norman epic of the same name; Layamon's language is recognisably Middle English, though his prosody shows a strong Anglo-Saxon influence remaining. Other transitional works were preserved as popular entertainment, including a variety of <a href="/wiki/Romance_%28genre%29.html" title="Romance (genre)">romances</a> and <a href="/wiki/Middle_English_Lyric.html" title="Middle English Lyric">lyrics</a>. With time, the English language regained prestige, and in 1362 it replaced French and Latin in <a href="/wiki/Parliament.html" title="Parliament">Parliament</a> and courts of law.</p>
<p>It was with the fourteenth century that major works of English literature began once again to appear; these include the so-called <a href="/wiki/Pearl_Poet.html" title="Pearl Poet">Pearl Poet</a>'s <i><a href="/wiki/Pearl_%28poem%29.html" title="Pearl (poem)">Pearl</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Patience_%28poem%29.html" title="Patience (poem)">Patience</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Cleanness.html" title="Cleanness">Cleanness</a></i>, and <i><a href="/wiki/Sir_Gawain_and_the_Green_Knight.html" title="Sir Gawain and the Green Knight">Sir Gawain and the Green Knight</a></i>; <a href="/wiki/William_Langland.html" title="William Langland">Langland</a>'s political and religious allegory <i><a href="/wiki/Piers_Plowman.html" title="Piers Plowman">Piers Plowman</a></i>; <a href="/wiki/John_Gower.html" title="John Gower">Gower</a>'s <i>Confessio Amantis</i>; and, of course, the works of <a href="/wiki/Geoffrey_Chaucer.html" title="Geoffrey Chaucer">Chaucer</a>, the most highly regarded English poet of the middle ages, who was seen by his contemporaries as a successor to the great tradition of <a href="/wiki/Virgil.html" title="Virgil">Virgil</a> and <a href="/wiki/Dante_Alighieri.html" title="Dante Alighieri">Dante</a>.</p>
<p>The reputation of Chaucer's successors in the 15th century has suffered in comparison with him, though <a href="/wiki/John_Lydgate.html" title="John Lydgate">Lydgate</a> and <a href="/wiki/John_Skelton.html" title="John Skelton">Skelton</a> are widely studied. However, the century really belongs to a group of remarkable <a href="/wiki/Scotland.html" title="Scotland">Scottish</a> writers. The rise of Scottish poetry began with the writing of <i>The Kingis Quair</i> by <a href="/wiki/James_I_of_Scotland.html" title="James I of Scotland">James I of Scotland</a>. The main poets of this Scottish group were <a href="/wiki/Robert_Henryson.html" title="Robert Henryson">Robert Henryson</a>, <a href="/wiki/William_Dunbar.html" title="William Dunbar">William Dunbar</a> and <a href="/wiki/Gavin_Douglas.html" title="Gavin Douglas">Gavin Douglas</a>. Henryson and Douglas introduced a note of almost savage satire, which may have owed something to the <a href="/wiki/Scottish_Gaelic_language.html" title="Scottish Gaelic language">Gaelic</a> <a href="/wiki/Bard.html" title="Bard">bards</a>, while Douglas' version of Virgil's <i>Aeneid</i> is one of the early monuments of Renaissance literary humanism in English.</p>

<p><a name="The_Renaissance_in_England" id="The_Renaissance_in_England"></a></p>
<h2>The Renaissance in England</h2>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Renaissance.html" title="Renaissance">Renaissance</a> was slow in coming to England, with the generally accepted start date being around 1509. It is also generally accepted that the English Renaissance extended until the Restoration in 1660. However, a number of factors had prepared the way for the introduction of the new learning long before this start date. A number of medieval poets had, as already noted, shown an interest in the ideas of Aristotle and the writings of European Renaissance precursors such as Dante.</p>
<p>The introduction of <a  class="new" title="Movable-block printing">movable-block printing</a> by <a href="/wiki/Caxton.html" title="Caxton">Caxton</a> in 1474 provided the means for the more rapid dissemination of new or recently rediscovered writers and thinkers. Caxton also printed the works of Chaucer and Gower and these books helped establish the idea of a native poetic tradition that was linked to its European counterparts. In addition, the writings of English humanists like <a href="/wiki/Thomas_More.html" title="Thomas More">Thomas More</a> and <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Elyot.html" title="Thomas Elyot">Thomas Elyot</a> helped bring the ideas and attitudes associated with the new learning to an English audience.</p>
<p>Three other factors in the establishment of the English Renaissance were the <a href="/wiki/Reformation.html" title="Reformation">Reformation</a>, Counter Reformation, and the opening of the era of English naval power and overseas exploration and expansion. The establishment of the <a href="/wiki/Church_of_England.html" title="Church of England">Church of England</a> in 1535 accelerated the process of questioning the Catholic world-view that had previously dominated intellectual and artistic life. At the same time, long-distance sea voyages helped provide the stimulus and information that underpinned a new understanding of the nature of the universe which resulted in the theories of <a href="/wiki/Nicolas_Copernicus.html" title="Nicolas Copernicus">Nicolas Copernicus</a> and <a href="/wiki/Johannes_Kepler.html" title="Johannes Kepler">Johannes Kepler</a>.</p>

<h3>Early Renaissance poetry</h3>
<p>With a small number of exceptions, the early years of the 16th century are not particularly notable. The Douglas <i>Aeneid</i> was completed in 1513 and <a href="/wiki/John_Skelton.html" title="John Skelton">John Skelton</a> wrote poems that were transitional between the late Medieval and Renaissance styles. The new king, <a href="/wiki/Henry_VIII_of_England.html" title="Henry VIII of England">Henry VIII</a>, was something of a poet himself. The most significant English poet of this period was <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Wyatt_%28poet%29.html" title="Thomas Wyatt (poet)">Thomas Wyatt</a>, who was among the first poets to write <a href="/wiki/Sonnet.html" title="Sonnet">sonnets</a> in English.</p>

<h3>The Elizabethans</h3>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Elizabethan.html" title="Elizabethan">Elizabethan</a> period in poetry is characterised by a number of frequently overlapping developments. The introduction and adaptation of themes, models and verse forms from other European traditions and classical literature, the Elizabethan song tradition, the emergence of a courtly poetry often centred around the figure of the monarch and the growth of a verse-based drama are among the most important of these developments.</p>

<h4>Elizabethan song</h4>
<p>A wide range of Elizabethan poets wrote songs, including <a href="/wiki/Nicholas_Grimald.html" title="Nicholas Grimald">Nicholas Grimald</a>, <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Nashe.html" title="Thomas Nashe">Thomas Nashe</a> and <a href="/wiki/Robert_Southwell.html" title="Robert Southwell">Robert Southwell</a>. There are also a large number of extant anonymous songs from the period. Perhaps the greatest of all the songwriters was <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Campion.html" title="Thomas Campion">Thomas Campion</a>. Campion is also notable because of his experiments with <a href="/wiki/Meter_%28poetry%29.html" title="Meter (poetry)">metres</a> based on counting syllables rather than stresses. These quantitative metres were based on classical models and should be viewed as part of the wider Renaissance revival of Greek and Roman artistic methods.</p>
<p>The songs were generally printed either in miscellanies or anthologies such as <a href="/wiki/Richard_Tottel.html" title="Richard Tottel">Richard Tottel</a>'s 1557 <i>Songs and Sonnets</i> or in songbooks that included printed music to enable performance. These performances formed an integral part of both public and private entertainment. By the end of the 16th century, a new generation of composers, including <a href="/wiki/John_Dowland.html" title="John Dowland">John Dowland</a>, <a href="/wiki/William_Byrd.html" title="William Byrd">William Byrd</a>, <a href="/wiki/Orlando_Gibbons.html" title="Orlando Gibbons">Orlando Gibbons</a>, <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Weelkes.html" title="Thomas Weelkes">Thomas Weelkes</a> and <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Morley.html" title="Thomas Morley">Thomas Morley</a> were helping to bring the art of Elizabethan song to an extremely high musical level.</p>

Edmund Spenser</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>With the consolidation of Elizabeth's power, a genuine court sympathetic to poetry and the arts in general emerged. This encouraged the emergence of a poetry aimed at, and often set in, an idealised version of the courtly world.</p>
<p>Among the best known examples of this are <a href="/wiki/Edmund_Spenser.html" title="Edmund Spenser">Edmund Spenser</a>'s <i><a href="/wiki/The_Faerie_Queene.html" title="The Faerie Queene">The Faerie Queene</a></i>, which is effectively an extended hymn of praise to the queen, and <a href="/wiki/Philip_Sidney.html" title="Philip Sidney">Philip Sydney</a>'s <i><a href="/wiki/Countess_of_Pembroke%27s_Arcadia.html" title="Countess of Pembroke's Arcadia">Arcadia</a></i>. This courtly trend can also be seen in Spenser's <i>Shepheardes Calender</i>. This poem marks the introduction into an English context of the classical <a href="/wiki/Pastoral.html" title="Pastoral">pastoral</a>, a mode of poetry that assumes an aristocratic audience with a certain kind of attitude to the land and peasants.

<h4>Elizabethan verse drama</h4>
<p>Elizabethan verse drama is widely considered to be one of the major achievements of literature in English, and its most famous exponent, <a href="/wiki/William_Shakespeare.html" title="William Shakespeare">William Shakespeare</a>, is revered as the greatest poet in the language. This drama, which served both as courtly masque and popular entertainment, deals with all the major themes of contemporary literature and life.</p>
<p>There are plays on <a href="/wiki/Europe.html" title="Europe">European</a>, <a href="/wiki/Classical_antiquity.html" title="Classical antiquity">classical</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Religious.html" title="Religious">religious</a> themes reflecting the importance of humanism and the Reformation.

A number of the comic works for the stage also use bucolic themes connected with the <a href="/wiki/Pastoral.html" title="Pastoral">pastoral</a> genre.</p>
<p>In addition to Shakespeare, other notable dramatists of the period include <a href="/wiki/Christopher_Marlowe.html" title="Christopher Marlowe">Christopher Marlowe</a>, <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Dekker.html" title="Thomas Dekker">Thomas Dekker</a> and <a href="/wiki/Ben_Jonson.html" title="Ben Jonson">Ben Jonson</a>.</p>

<p>The early 17th century saw the emergence of this group of poets who wrote in a witty, complicated style.

<h4>The Cavalier poets</h4>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Cavalier_poet.html" title="Cavalier poet">Cavalier poets</a> wrote in a lighter, more elegant and artificial style than the Metaphysical poets. Leading members of the group include <a href="/wiki/Ben_Jonson.html" title="Ben Jonson">Ben Jonson</a>, <a href="/wiki/Richard_Lovelace.html" title="Richard Lovelace">Richard Lovelace</a>, <a href="/wiki/Robert_Herrick_%28poet%29.html" title="Robert Herrick (poet)">Robert Herrick</a>, <a href="/wiki/Edmund_Waller.html" title="Edmund Waller">Edmund Waller</a>, <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Carew.html" title="Thomas Carew">Thomas Carew</a> and <a href="/wiki/John_Denham_%28poet%29.html" title="John Denham (poet)">John Denham</a>.

<p>The early 17th century also saw a group of poets who were interested in following Spenser's example in the area of long mythic poems.

<h2>The Restoration and 18th century</h2>
<p>It is perhaps ironic that <i>Paradise Lost</i>, a story of fallen pride, was the first major poem to appear in England after the Restoration. The court of <a href="/wiki/Charles_II_of_England.html" title="Charles II of England">Charles II</a> had, in its years in <a href="/wiki/France.html" title="France">France</a>, learned a worldliness and sophistication that marked it as distinctively different from the monarchies that preceded the Republic.

<p>It is hardly surprising that the world of fashion and <a href="/wiki/Scepticism.html" title="Scepticism">scepticism</a> that emerged encouraged the art of <a href="/wiki/Satire.html" title="Satire">satire</a>.

What is perhaps more surprising is that their satire was often written in defence of public order and the established church and government. However, writers such as Pope used their gift for satire to create scathing works responding to their detractors or to criticise what they saw as social atrocities perpetrated by the government. Pope's "The Dunciad" is a satirical slaying of two of his literary adversaries (Lewis Theobald, and Colley Cibber in a later version), expressing the view that British society was falling apart morally, culturally, and intellectually.</p>

<h3>The late 18th century</h3>
<p>Towards the end of the 18th century, poetry began to move away from the strict Augustan ideals and a new emphasis on sentiment and the feelings of the poet.

William Wordsworth</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The last quarter of the 18th century was a time of social and political turbulence, with revolutions in the <a href="/wiki/United_States.html" title="United States">United States</a>, <a href="/wiki/France.html" title="France">France</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ireland.html" title="Ireland">Ireland</a> and elsewhere. In <a href="/wiki/Kingdom_of_Great_Britain.html" title="Kingdom of Great Britain">Great Britain</a>, movement for social change and a more inclusive sharing of power was also growing. This was the backdrop against which the Romantic movement in English poetry emerged.</p>
<p>The main poets of this movement were <a href="/wiki/William_Blake.html" title="William Blake">William Blake</a>, <a href="/wiki/William_Wordsworth.html" title="William Wordsworth">William Wordsworth</a>, <a href="/wiki/Samuel_Taylor_Coleridge.html" title="Samuel Taylor Coleridge">Samuel Taylor Coleridge</a>, <a href="/wiki/Percy_Bysshe_Shelley.html" title="Percy Bysshe Shelley">Percy Bysshe Shelley</a>, <a href="/wiki/Lord_Byron.html" title="Lord Byron">Lord Byron</a>, and <a href="/wiki/John_Keats.html" title="John Keats">John Keats</a>. The birth of English Romanticism is often dated to the publication in 1798 of Wordsworth and Coleridge's <i>Lyrical Ballads</i>. However, Blake had been publishing since the early 1780s. However, much of the focus on Blake only came about during the last century when Northrap Frye discussed his work in his book "The Anatomy of Criticism."</p>
<p>In poetry, the <a href="/wiki/Romanticism.html" title="Romanticism">Romantic</a> movement emphasised the creative expression of the individual and the need to find and formulate new forms of expression. The Romantics, with the partial exception of Byron, rejected the poetic ideals of the eighteenth century, and each of them returned to Milton for inspiration, though each drew something different from Milton. They also put a good deal of stress on their own originality. To the Romantics, the moment of creation was the most important in poetic expression and could not be repeated once it passed. Because of this new emphasis, poems that were not complete were nonetheless included in a poet's body of work (such as Coleridge's "Kubla Khan" and "Christabel").</p>
<p>Additionally, the Romantic movement marked a shift the use of language. Attempting to express the "language of the common man", Wordsworth and his fellow Romantic poets focused on employing poetic language for a wider audience, countering the mimetic, tightly constrained Neo-Classic poems (although it's important to note that the poet wrote first and foremost for his own creative, expression). In Shelley's "Defense of Poetry", he contends that poets are the "creators of language" and that the poet's job is to refresh language for their society.</p>
<p>The Romantics were not the only poets of note at this time. In the work of <a href="/wiki/John_Clare.html" title="John Clare">John Clare</a> the late Augustan voice is blended with a peasant's first-hand knowledge to produce arguably some of the finest nature poetry in the English language. Another contemporary poet who does not fit into the Romantic group was <a href="/wiki/Walter_Savage_Landor.html" title="Walter Savage Landor">Walter Savage Landor</a>. Landor was a classicist whose poetry forms a link between the Augustans and <a href="/wiki/Robert_Browning.html" title="Robert Browning">Robert Browning</a>, who much admired it.</p>

<p>The major High Victorian poets were <a href="/wiki/Alfred_Tennyson.html" title="Alfred Tennyson">Alfred, Lord Tennyson</a>, <a href="/wiki/Robert_Browning.html" title="Robert Browning">Robert Browning</a>, <a href="/wiki/Elizabeth_Barrett_Browning.html" title="Elizabeth Barrett Browning">Elizabeth Barrett Browning</a>, <a href="/wiki/Matthew_Arnold.html" title="Matthew Arnold">Matthew Arnold</a> and <a href="/wiki/Gerard_Manley_Hopkins.html" title="Gerard Manley Hopkins">Gerard Manley Hopkins</a>. Tennyson was, to some degree, the Spenser of the new age and his <i>Idylls of the Kings</i> can be read as a Victorian version of <i>The Faerie Queen</i>, that is as a poem that sets out to provide a mythic foundation to the idea of empire.</p>
<p>The Brownings spent much of their time out of England and explored European models and matter in much of their poetry. Robert Browning's great innovation was the <a href="/wiki/Dramatic_poetry.html" title="Dramatic poetry">dramatic monologue</a>, which he used to its full extent in his long novel in verse, <i>The Ring and the Book</i>. Elizabeth Barrett Browning is perhaps best remembered for <i>Sonnets from the Portuguese</i> but her long poem <i>Aurora Leigh</i> is one of the classics of 19th century <a href="/wiki/Feminist.html" title="Feminist">feminist</a> literature.</p>
<p>Matthew Arnold was much influenced by Wordsworth, though his poem <i>Dover Beach</i> is often considered a precursor of the <a href="/wiki/Modernist_poetry.html" title="Modernist poetry">modernist</a> revolution. Hopkins wrote in relative obscurity and his work was not published until after his death. His unusual style (involving what he called "sprung rhythm" and heavy reliance on rhyme and alliteration) had a considerable influence on many of the poets of the 1940s.</p>

<p>The <a href="/wiki/Pre-Raphaelite_Brotherhood.html" title="Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood">Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood</a> was a mid-19th century arts movement dedicated to the reform of what they considered the sloppy <a href="/wiki/Mannerism.html" title="Mannerism">Mannerist</a> painting of the day. Although primarily concerned with the visual arts, two members, the brother and sister <a href="/wiki/Dante_Gabriel_Rossetti.html" title="Dante Gabriel Rossetti">Dante Gabriel Rossetti</a> and <a href="/wiki/Christina_Rossetti.html" title="Christina Rossetti">Christina Rossetti</a>, were also poets of some ability. Their poetry shares many of the concerns of the painters; an interest in Medieval models, an almost obsessive attention to visual detail and an occasional tendency to lapse into whimsy.</p>
<p>Dante Rossetti worked with, and had some influence on, the leading <a href="/wiki/Arts_and_Crafts.html" title="Arts and Crafts">Arts and Crafts</a> painter and poet <a href="/wiki/William_Morris.html" title="William Morris">William Morris</a>. Morris shared the Pre-Raphaelite interest in the poetry of the European Middle Ages, to the point of producing some illuminated manuscript volumes of his work.</p>
<p>Towards the end of the century, English poets began to take an interest in French <a href="/wiki/Symbolism.html" title="Symbolism">symbolism</a> and Victorian poetry entered a decadent <i>fin-de-siecle</i> phase. Two groups of poets emerged, the <i><a href="/wiki/Yellow_Book.html" title="Yellow Book">Yellow Book</a></i> poets who adhered to the tenets of <a href="/wiki/Aestheticism.html" title="Aestheticism">Aestheticism</a>, including <a href="/wiki/Algernon_Charles_Swinburne.html" title="Algernon Charles Swinburne">Algernon Charles Swinburne</a>, <a href="/wiki/Oscar_Wilde.html" title="Oscar Wilde">Oscar Wilde</a> and <a href="/wiki/Arthur_Symons.html" title="Arthur Symons">Arthur Symons</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Rhymer%27s_Club.html" title="Rhymer's Club">Rhymer's Club</a> group that included <a href="/wiki/Ernest_Dowson.html" title="Ernest Dowson">Ernest Dowson</a>, <a href="/wiki/Lionel_Johnson.html" title="Lionel Johnson">Lionel Johnson</a> and <a href="/wiki/W._B._Yeats.html" title="W.

<h3>The first three decades</h3>
<p>The Victorian era continued into the early years of the 20th century and two figures emerged as the leading representative of the poetry of the old era to act as a bridge into the new. These were <a href="/wiki/W._B._Yeats.html" title="W. B. Yeats">Yeats</a> and <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Hardy.html" title="Thomas Hardy">Thomas Hardy</a>. Yeats, although not a modernist, was to learn a lot from the new poetic movements that sprang up around him and adapted his writing to the new circumstances. Hardy was, in terms of technique at least, a more traditional figure and was to be a reference point for various anti-modernist reactions, especially from the 1950s onwards.</p>

<h4>The Georgian poets</h4>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Georgian_poets.html" title="Georgian poets">Georgian poets</a> were the first major grouping of the post-Victorian era. Their work appeared in a series of five anthologies called <i>Georgian Poetry</i> which were published by <a href="/wiki/Harold_Monro.html" title="Harold Monro">Harold Monro</a> and edited by <a href="/wiki/Edward_Marsh.html" title="Edward Marsh">Edward Marsh</a>. The poets featured included <a href="/wiki/Edmund_Blunden.html" title="Edmund Blunden">Edmund Blunden</a>, <a href="/wiki/Rupert_Brooke.html" title="Rupert Brooke">Rupert Brooke</a>, <a href="/wiki/Robert_Graves.html" title="Robert Graves">Robert Graves</a>, <a href="/wiki/D._H._Lawrence.html" title="D.

Lawrence</a>, <a href="/wiki/Walter_de_la_Mare.html" title="Walter de la Mare">Walter de la Mare</a> and <a href="/wiki/Siegfried_Sassoon.html" title="Siegfried Sassoon">Siegfried Sassoon</a>. Their poetry represented something of a reaction to the decadence of the 1890s and tended towards the sentimental. Brooke and Sassoon were to go on to win reputations as war poets and Lawrence quickly distanced himself from the group and was associated with the modernist movement.</p>

<h4>World War I</h4>
<p>As already noted, the Georgian poets Rupert Brooke and Siegfried Sassoon are now mostly remembered for their war poetry. Other notable poets who wrote about the <a href="/wiki/World_War_I.html" title="World War I">war</a> include <a href="/wiki/Isaac_Rosenberg.html" title="Isaac Rosenberg">Isaac Rosenberg</a>, <a href="/wiki/Edward_Thomas.html" title="Edward Thomas">Edward Thomas</a>, <a href="/wiki/Wilfred_Owen.html" title="Wilfred Owen">Wilfred Owen</a>, <a href="/wiki/May_Cannan.html" title="May Cannan">May Cannan</a> and, from the home front, Hardy and <a href="/wiki/Rudyard_Kipling.html" title="Rudyard Kipling">Rudyard Kipling</a>. Although many of these poets wrote socially aware criticism of the war, most remained technically conservative and traditionalist.</p>

In the world of poetry, this period also saw American writers at the forefront of <i>avant-garde</i> practices. Among the foremost of these poets were <a href="/wiki/T.S._Eliot.html" title="T.S. Eliot">T.S. Eliot</a> and <a href="/wiki/Ezra_Pound.html" title="Ezra Pound">Ezra Pound</a>, both of whom spent part, and in Eliot's case a considerable part, of their writing lives in England.</p>
<p>Pound's involvement with the <a href="/wiki/Imagist.html" title="Imagist">Imagists</a> marked the beginning of a revolution in the way poetry was written. English poets involved with this group included D. H. Lawrence, <a href="/wiki/Richard_Aldington.html" title="Richard Aldington">Richard Aldington</a>, <a href="/wiki/T._E._Hulme.html" title="T. E. Hulme">T. E. Hulme</a>, <a href="/wiki/F._S._Flint.html" title="F. S. Flint">F. S. Flint</a>, E. E.

Eliot, particularly after the publication of <i>The Waste Land</i>, became a major figure and influence on other English poets.</p>
<p>In addition to these poets, other English modernists began to emerge. These included the London-Welsh poet and painter <a href="/wiki/David_Jones_%28poet%29.html" title="David Jones (poet)">David Jones</a>, whose first book, <i>In Parenthesis</i>, was one of the very few experimental poems to come out of World War I, the Scot <a href="/wiki/Hugh_MacDiarmid.html" title="Hugh MacDiarmid">Hugh MacDiarmid</a>, <a href="/wiki/Mina_Loy.html" title="Mina Loy">Mina Loy</a> and <a href="/wiki/Basil_Bunting.html" title="Basil Bunting">Basil Bunting</a>.</p>

<h3>The Thirties</h3>
<p>The poets who began to emerge in the 1930s had two things in common; they had all been born too late to have any real experience of the pre-<a href="/wiki/World_War_I.html" title="World War I">World War I</a> world and they grew up in a period of social, economic and political turmoil. Perhaps as a consequence of these facts, themes of community, social (in)justice and war seem to dominate the poetry of the decade.</p>

<p>The poetic landscape of the decade was dominated by four poets; <a href="/wiki/W._H._Auden.html" title="W. H. Auden">W. H.

These poets were all, in their early days at least, politically active on the <a href="/wiki/Left.html" title="Left">Left</a>. Although they admired Eliot, they also represented a move away from the technical innovations of their modernist predecessors. A number of other, less enduring, poets also worked in the same vein. One of these was <a href="/wiki/Michael_Roberts.html" title="Michael Roberts">Michael Roberts</a>, whose <i>New Country</i> anthology both introduced the group to a wider audience and gave them their name.</p>

<h4>Surrealism and others</h4>
<p>The 1930s also saw the emergence of a home-grown English <a href="/wiki/Surrealist.html" title="Surrealist">surrealist</a> poetry whose main exponents were <a href="/wiki/David_Gascoyne.html" title="David Gascoyne">David Gascoyne</a>, <a href="/wiki/Hugh_Sykes_Davies.html" title="Hugh Sykes Davies">Hugh Sykes Davies</a>, <a href="/wiki/George_Barker_%28poet%29.html" title="George Barker (poet)">George Barker</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Philip_O%27Connor.html" title="Philip O'Connor">Philip O'Connor</a>. These poets turned to French models rather than either the <i>New Country</i> poets or English-language modernism, and their work was to prove of importance to later English experimental poets as it broadened the scope of the English <i>avant-garde</i> tradition.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/John_Betjeman.html" title="John Betjeman">John Betjeman</a> and <a href="/wiki/Stevie_Smith.html" title="Stevie Smith">Stevie Smith</a>, who were two of the most significant poets of this period, stood outside all schools and groups. Betjeman was a quietly ironic poet of Middle England with a fine command of a wide range of <a href="/wiki/Verse.html" title="Verse">verse</a> techniques. Smith was an entirely unclassifiable one-off voice.</p>

Technically, many of these war poets owed something to the 1930s poets, but their work grew out of the particular circumstances in which they found themselves living and fighting.</p>
