<p><b>Edward VI</b> (<a href="/wiki/October_12.html" title="October 12">12 October</a> <a href="/wiki/1537.html" title="1537">1537</a> – <a href="/wiki/July_6.html" title="July 6">6 July</a> <a href="/wiki/1553.html" title="1553">1553</a>) became <a href="/wiki/King_of_England.html" title="King of England">King of England</a> and <a href="/wiki/King_of_Ireland.html" title="King of Ireland">Ireland</a> on <a href="/wiki/January_28.html" title="January 28">28 January</a> <a href="/wiki/1547.html" title="1547">1547</a>, at just nine years of age. Edward, the son of <a href="/wiki/Henry_VIII_of_England.html" title="Henry VIII of England">Henry VIII</a> and <a href="/wiki/Jane_Seymour.html" title="Jane Seymour">Jane Seymour</a>, was the third monarch of the <a href="/wiki/Tudor_dynasty.html" title="Tudor dynasty">Tudor dynasty</a> and England's first ruler who was <a href="/wiki/Protestantism.html" title="Protestantism">Protestant</a> at the time of his ascension to the throne. Edward's entire rule was mediated through a council of <a href="/wiki/Regent.html" title="Regent">regency</a> as he never reached majority. The council was first led by his uncle, <a href="/wiki/Edward_Seymour%2C_1st_Duke_of_Somerset.html" title="Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset">Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset</a> (1547-49), and then by <a href="/wiki/John_Dudley%2C_1st_Duke_of_Northumberland.html" title="John Dudley, 1st Duke of Northumberland">John Dudley, 1st Duke of Northumberland</a> (1549-1553).</p>
<p>Although Henry VIII had broken the link between the English church and Rome, it was during Edward's reign that Protestantism was established for the first time in England. It was during Edward's reign that <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Cranmer.html" title="Thomas Cranmer">Thomas Cranmer</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Archbishop_of_Canterbury.html" title="Archbishop of Canterbury">Archbishop of Canterbury</a>, implemented the <i><a href="/wiki/Book_of_Common_Prayer.html" title="Book of Common Prayer">Book of Common Prayer</a></i>.</p>
<p>Edward's reign was marked by increasingly harsh Protestant reforms, the loss of control of <a href="/wiki/Scotland.html" title="Scotland">Scotland</a>, and an economic downturn. A period of social unrest begun earlier intensified during his rule, and conflicts with the <a href="/wiki/France.html" title="France">French</a> increased.</p>
<p>When it became clear that Edward's life was to be a short one, the king's advisors persuaded him to attempt to exclude his two half sisters, the devout Catholic <a href="/wiki/Mary_I_of_England.html" title="Mary I of England">Mary</a> and moderate Protestant <a href="/wiki/Elizabeth_I_of_England.html" title="Elizabeth I of England">Elizabeth</a>, from the line of succession to the throne in order to put the <a href="/wiki/Lady_Jane_Grey.html" title="Lady Jane Grey">Lady Jane Grey</a>, the solidly Protestant daughter-in-law of the chief Regent, next in line to succeed the king. Following Edward's death at age fifteen, a disputed succession reopened the religious conflicts. Lady Jane was Queen for only nine days, during that time reigning in name only, before she was replaced by Mary. Queen Mary then sought to undo many of Edward's Protestant reforms.</p>

It is sometimes asserted that Jane sacrificed her life by the performance of a <a href="/wiki/Caesarean_section.html" title="Caesarean section">Caesarean section</a>, but such assertions are without basis.

<p>Henry VIII was extremely pleased by the birth of a male heir.

<p>Up until recently, it has been widely accepted that Edward VI was an extremely sickly child. Theories have speculated that he suffered from <a href="/wiki/Congenital_syphilis.html" title="Congenital syphilis">congenital syphilis</a><sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a  title="">[3]</a></sup> or from <a href="/wiki/Tuberculosis.html" title="Tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a>. His first illness, experienced at the age of 4, was a "quartan fever" which lasted for months. His supposed frailty may have led Henry VIII to quickly seek to remarry; the King's last three marriages (<a href="/wiki/Anne_of_Cleves.html" title="Anne of Cleves">Anne of Cleves</a>, <a href="/wiki/Katherine_Howard.html" title="Katherine Howard">Katherine Howard</a>, and Catherine Parr), however, did not produce any children. Edward's own journals mention no illness at all apart from a bout of <a href="/wiki/Measles.html" title="Measles">measles</a> in 1552, and the pulmonary tuberculosis which killed him. The policies of the Duke of Northumberland also indicate that he was making a foundation on which Edward was expected to build when he reached his majority, rather than expecting Edward to die young.</p>
<p>Edward's supposed physical difficulties did not impede his education; on the contrary, the young prince was a very bright child, already able to read and speak <a href="/wiki/Greek_language.html" title="Greek language">Greek</a> and <a href="/wiki/Latin.html" title="Latin">Latin</a> at the age of seven. His principal tutors were <a href="/wiki/Richard_Cox_%28bishop%29.html" title="Richard Cox (bishop)">Bishop Richard Cox</a>, <a href="/wiki/John_Cheke.html" title="John Cheke">Sir John Cheke</a> and <a href="/wiki/Jean_Belmain.html" title="Jean Belmain">Jean Belmain</a>. These were able teachers and great minds at the time and imparted in Edward his knowledge of the Classics, seemingly based on the course of instruction described by <a href="/wiki/Erasmus.html" title="Erasmus">Erasmus</a> and <a href="/wiki/Vives.html" title="Vives">Vives</a>. Importantly, Henry VIII chose his tutors because they were <a href="/wiki/Humanists.html" title="Humanists">humanists</a>: he may also have considered their moderate Protestantism when making his choice <sup id="_ref-Jordan68_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[4]</a></sup>. Edward's education was coloured by the Reformation that had swept through the <a href="/wiki/Netherlands.html" title="Netherlands">Netherlands</a> and <a href="/wiki/Germany.html" title="Germany">Germany</a><sup id="_ref-Will66_1" class="reference"><a  title="">[1]</a></sup>. He later learned to speak <a href="/wiki/French_language.html" title="French language">French</a> and <a href="/wiki/Greek_language.html" title="Greek language">Greek</a>, and, by the age of thirteen, he was writing essays into the latter language. He was quite fond of his stepmother Catherine Parr, and wrote three letters to her, one each in French, English and Latin. The rest of the letters he wrote were in Latin to his sisters. Edward also had strong feelings for his sister Mary, although these were tempered by their disagreements over religion. His love of learning and writing led him to found many grammar schools that were named after him.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a  title="">[5]</a></sup></p>

<p>Henry VIII died on <a href="/wiki/January_28.html" title="January 28">28 January</a> <a href="/wiki/1547.html" title="1547">1547</a>, when Edward was only 9. His <a href="/wiki/Will_%28law%29.html" title="Will (law)">will</a> named sixteen <a href="/wiki/Executor.html" title="Executor">executors</a>, who were to act as a Council of <a href="/wiki/Regent.html" title="Regent">Regency</a> until Edward VI achieved majority at the age of eighteen (although it was agreed by the Council in 1552 that Edward would reach his majority at 16). These executors were to be supplemented by twelve assistants, who would participate only when the others deemed it fit. The executors were all inclined towards religious reformation, whose most prominent opponents, <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Howard%2C_3rd_Duke_of_Norfolk.html" title="Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk">Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk</a>, <a href="/wiki/Stephen_Gardiner.html" title="Stephen Gardiner">Stephen Gardiner</a> (the <a href="/wiki/Bishop_of_Winchester.html" title="Bishop of Winchester">Bishop of Winchester</a>) and <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Thirlby.html" title="Thomas Thirlby">Thomas Thirlby</a> (the <a href="/wiki/Bishop_of_Westminster.html" title="Bishop of Westminster">Bishop of Westminster</a>), were excluded. The Council immediately appointed the king's maternal uncle <a href="/wiki/Edward_Seymour%2C_1st_Duke_of_Somerset.html" title="Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset">Edward Seymour, 1st Earl of Hertford</a> to serve as <a href="/wiki/Lord_Protector.html" title="Lord Protector">Lord Protector of the Realm and Governor of the King's Person</a> during Edward's minority.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a  title="">[6]</a></sup> A few days after Henry VIII's death, Lord Hertford was created <a href="/wiki/Duke_of_Somerset.html" title="Duke of Somerset">Duke of Somerset</a> and appointed to the influential positions of <a href="/wiki/Lord_High_Treasurer.html" title="Lord High Treasurer">Lord High Treasurer</a> and <a href="/wiki/Earl_Marshal.html" title="Earl Marshal">Earl Marshal</a>. Edward VI was crowned as king at <a href="/wiki/Westminister_Abbey.html" title="Westminister Abbey">Westminister Abbey</a> on <a href="/wiki/February_20.html" title="February 20">20 February</a> <a href="/wiki/1547.html" title="1547">1547</a>.<sup id="_ref-Will66_2" class="reference"><a  title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>To allay all doubts regarding the validity of Henry VIII's will, all the executors sought reappointment from Edward. On <a href="/wiki/March_13.html" title="March 13">13 March</a> <a href="/wiki/1547.html" title="1547">1547</a>, Edward VI created a new Council of twenty-six members. The Council consisted of all the executors and assistants, except for <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Wriothesley%2C_1st_Earl_of_Southampton.html" title="Thomas Wriothesley, 1st Earl of Southampton">Thomas Wriothesley, 1st Earl of Southampton</a> (who, whilst serving as <a href="/wiki/Lord_Chancellor.html" title="Lord Chancellor">Lord Chancellor</a>, had illegally delegated some of his powers to other officials) and Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset. Somerset, as Lord Protector, was supposed to act only on the advice of the other executors but was able to gain near complete control of government after obtaining the power to change the composition of the Council at his whim. The Lord Protector, then, became the real ruler of England with Edward VI acting in a largely ceremonial role. Somerset's administration of the country would prove to be more merciful than tactical and more idealistic than practical; Henry VIII's treason and heresy acts were repealed or changed, resulting in social and political unrest.<sup id="_ref-EB-UK_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[7]</a></sup></p>

<p><a name="Ineffective_rule" id="Ineffective_rule"></a></p>
<h3>Ineffective rule</h3>
<p>One of the Duke of Somerset's primary aims was to achieve a union between <a href="/wiki/England.html" title="England">England</a> and <a href="/wiki/Scotland.html" title="Scotland">Scotland</a>. In late 1547, an English army marched into Scotland and took control of the <a href="/wiki/Lowlands.html" title="Lowlands">Lowlands</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Pinkie_Cleugh.html" title="Battle of Pinkie Cleugh">Battle of Pinkie Cleugh</a>. This action was the closing chapter in the <a href="/wiki/War_of_the_Rough_Wooing.html" title="War of the Rough Wooing">War of the Rough Wooing</a> and in the <a href="/wiki/Anglo-Scottish_Wars.html" title="Anglo-Scottish Wars">Anglo-Scottish Wars</a> that had been simmering throughout the 16th century. In 1548, however, <a href="/wiki/Mary_I_of_Scotland.html" title="Mary I of Scotland">Mary</a>, the young Scottish Queen, was betrothed to the <a href="/wiki/Dauphin.html" title="Dauphin">Dauphin</a> <a href="/wiki/Francis_II_of_France.html" title="Francis II of France">Francis</a>, the heir-apparent to the French throne, thereby strengthening the alliance between <a href="/wiki/France.html" title="France">France</a> and Scotland.</p>

The political aim of the work was to unite moderate religious factions into a single Protestant fold by obscuring the role of the Mass and downplaying the status of saints. Its use was enforced by an <a href="/wiki/Act_of_Uniformity_1549.html" title="Act of Uniformity 1549">Act of Uniformity 1549</a> but it served only to antagonise both Protestants and Catholics.<sup id="_ref-EB-UK_1" class="reference"><a  title="">[7]</a></sup> Zealous reformers such as <a href="/wiki/John_Knox.html" title="John Knox">John Knox</a> were appointed as court chaplains.

<h3>Prayer book rebellion</h3>
<p>The Prayer book rebellion was a movement opposing the <a href="/wiki/Act_of_Uniformity.html" title="Act of Uniformity">Act of Uniformity</a>. After <a href="/wiki/Henry_VIII.html" title="Henry VIII">Henry VIII</a> broke with the Roman Catholic Church and declared his own <a href="/wiki/Church_of_England.html" title="Church of England">Church of England</a> in 1536, he never introduced hard-line reforms to break completely, as he was still Catholic at heart. The <a href="/wiki/Archbishop_of_Canterbury.html" title="Archbishop of Canterbury">Archbishop of Canterbury</a>, <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Cranmer.html" title="Thomas Cranmer">Thomas Cranmer</a>, influenced Edward, as <a href="/wiki/Prince_of_Wales.html" title="Prince of Wales">Prince of Wales</a>, to follow the <a href="/wiki/Protestant.html" title="Protestant">Protestant</a> faith. When Henry died in 1547, Cranmer and Somerset sought to have a completely English Church.</p>
<p>The introduction of the Book of Common Prayer was disapproved of by most of England. However, it was especially opposed in <a href="/wiki/Cornwall%2C_England.html" title="Cornwall, England">Cornwall</a>, as the only language spoken there was the native <a href="/wiki/Cornish_language.html" title="Cornish language">Cornish language</a> and <a href="/wiki/Latin.html" title="Latin">Latin</a>: Somerset and Cranmer had assumed that English was spoken all over the country. When the protesters explained that they spoke no English, Somerset refused to alter the Act: English was to be the language of the true English Church. The protesters responded by forming an <a href="/wiki/Army.html" title="Army">army</a> of up to 3000 men, led by Sir William Body and other prominent Catholic landowners. They proceeded to the city of Exeter, which they had assumed would support them, but the <a href="/wiki/Mayor.html" title="Mayor">mayor</a> refused to open the city gates. A five-week <a href="/wiki/Siege.html" title="Siege">siege</a> began, during which time London had time to formulate a plan of action.</p>
<p>Somerset sent <a href="/wiki/Peter_Carew.html" title="Peter Carew">Sir Peter Carew</a> and his brother to keep the rebels occupied until <a href="/wiki/John_Russell%2C_1st_Earl_of_Bedford.html" title="John Russell, 1st Earl of Bedford">John Russell, 1st Earl of Bedford</a> could gather an army to counter the rebellion. Russell, however, was reluctant to attack until reinforcements from Italy and Germany arrived. Once Exeter was <a href="/wiki/Besieged.html" title="Besieged">besieged</a>, the rebels moved to attack Russell, but he surprised the main body of rebels in marshland, who were saved only by reinforcements. The rebels continued their protests against the Act of Uniformity, declaring, "<i>and so we Cornishmen, whereof certain of us understand no English, utterly refuse this new English</i>".</p>
<p>Eventually, Russell's promised foreign reinforcements arrived, headed by Lord Grey. The counter-attack followed. The rebels went through a <a href="/wiki/Valley.html" title="Valley">valley</a>, where they were cut off and slaughtered by Gawen Carew. Over 4,000 lost their lives, and English soon became the first language. However, it did not help Somerset's popularity, and he was soon considered a <a href="/wiki/Liability.html" title="Liability">liability</a>.</p>

John Dudley, 1st Duke of Northumberland, led the Council of Regency after the downfall of Somerset</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The rise of the Earl of Warwick (later Duke of Northumberland) was accompanied by the fall of Catholicism in England. Use of the <i><a href="/wiki/Book_of_Common_Prayer.html" title="Book of Common Prayer">Book of Common Prayer</a></i> in all Church services was more strictly enforced and all official editions of the <a href="/wiki/Bible.html" title="Bible">Bible</a> were accompanied by anti-Catholic annotations. Catholic symbols in churches were desecrated by mobs and the <a  class="new" title="Ordinal of 1550">Ordinal of 1550</a> replaced the divine ordination of priests with a government-run appointment system.<sup id="_ref-EB-UK_4" class="reference"><a  title="">[7]</a></sup> Religious <a href="/wiki/Dissenter.html" title="Dissenter">dissenters</a>, moreover, were often persecuted and <a href="/wiki/Execution_by_burning.html" title="Execution by burning">burnt at the stake</a>. In 1550 and 1551, the most powerful Roman Catholic Bishops, <a href="/wiki/Edmund_Bonner.html" title="Edmund Bonner">Edmund Bonner</a> (the <a href="/wiki/Bishop_of_London.html" title="Bishop of London">Bishop of London</a>), Stephen Gardiner (the <a href="/wiki/Bishop_of_Winchester.html" title="Bishop of Winchester">Bishop of Winchester</a>) and <a href="/wiki/Nicholas_Heath.html" title="Nicholas Heath">Nicholas Heath</a> (the <a href="/wiki/Bishop_of_Worcester.html" title="Bishop of Worcester">Bishop of Worcester</a>) included, were deposed and their places taken by Protestant reformers such as <a href="/wiki/Nicholas_Ridley_%28martyr%29.html" title="Nicholas Ridley (martyr)">Nicholas Ridley</a>. The Council under Warwick also systematically confiscated church territories and Warwick himself had the ambition to be the largest landowner in England.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a  title="">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Duke of Somerset, who agreed to submit to Lord Warwick, was released from prison and readmitted to the <a href="/wiki/Privy_Council_of_the_United_Kingdom.html" title="Privy Council of the United Kingdom">Privy Council</a>. Within a few months, he found himself powerful enough to demand the release of other political and religious prisoners. He opposed the Council's attempt to curtail the religious liberty of Edward's sister, Mary. The Duke of Somerset's opposition to the more radical form of religious Reformation irked Lord Warwick.</p>
<p>Warwick attempted to increase his own prestige; on his advice, Edward created him <a href="/wiki/Duke_of_Northumberland.html" title="Duke of Northumberland">Duke of Northumberland</a> and bestowed honours on his numerous supporters. The Duke of Northumberland began a campaign to discredit the Duke of Somerset. The people of <a href="/wiki/London.html" title="London">London</a> were informed that the Duke of Somerset would destroy their city; Edward was told that the Duke would depose and imprison him and seize his Crown. It was also suggested that the Duke of Somerset had plotted to murder the Duke of Northumberland. In December of 1551, the Duke of Somerset was tried for <a href="/wiki/Treason.html" title="Treason">treason</a> on the grounds that he had attempted to imprison a member of the King's Council. The treason charge, however, could not be proven; instead, Somerset was found guilty of participating in unlawful assemblies, but was still sentenced to death. The Duke of Somerset was subsequently executed in January 1552.</p>
<p>On the day after the Duke of Somerset's execution, a new session of Parliament began. It passed the <a href="/wiki/Act_of_Uniformity_1552.html" title="Act of Uniformity 1552">Act of Uniformity 1552</a>, under which a second <i>Book of Common Prayer</i> was required for church services. Unauthorised worship was punishable by up to life imprisonment.</p>

A power struggle ensued as Edward VI lay dying of tuberculosis</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>During his father's reign Edward had effectively been mollycoddled and kept in seclusion. Edward desperately wanted his own freedom, and indulged in the early years of his reign with other children of his age. He became extremely fond of sports such as tennis. During the winter of 1552–53, Edward VI, strained by physical activities in the bitter weather, contracted a cold. Doctors tried to help by administering various medicines, but their efforts were in vain, leaving Edward in perpetual agony. The first symptoms of <a href="/wiki/Tuberculosis.html" title="Tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a> were manifest in January 1553 and by May it was obvious that his condition was fatal.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a  title="">[11]</a></sup> Edward was enough the master of his own destiny to have concerns about the succession addressed. Having been brought up a Protestant, he had no desire to be succeeded by his older half-sister and devout Catholic, Mary.</p>
<p>At the same time, the Duke of Northumberland was eager to retain his own power. He did not find the next two individuals in the line of succession, Mary and <a href="/wiki/Elizabeth_I_of_England.html" title="Elizabeth I of England">Elizabeth</a>, conducive to his aims. The third individual in the line of succession under Henry VIII's will was <a href="/wiki/Lady_Frances_Brandon.html" title="Lady Frances Brandon">Lady Frances Brandon</a> (the daughter of Henry's younger sister <a href="/wiki/Mary_Tudor_%28queen_consort_of_France%29.html" title="Mary Tudor (queen consort of France)">Mary</a> by <a href="/wiki/Charles_Brandon%2C_1st_Duke_of_Suffolk.html" title="Charles Brandon, 1st Duke of Suffolk">Charles Brandon, 1st Duke of Suffolk</a>); she, too, was not to Northumberland's liking. Northumberland feared that Frances' husband, <a href="/wiki/Henry_Grey%2C_1st_Duke_of_Suffolk.html" title="Henry Grey, 1st Duke of Suffolk">Henry Grey, 1st Duke of Suffolk</a>, would claim the Crown as his own. The Duke of Northumberland then foolishly attempted to rule through the Duchess of Suffolk's daughter, the <a href="/wiki/Lady_Jane_Grey.html" title="Lady Jane Grey">Lady Jane Grey</a>. Jane was married off to the Duke of Northumberland's younger son, <a href="/wiki/Guilford_Dudley.html" title="Guilford Dudley">Guilford Dudley</a>.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/June_11.html" title="June 11">11 June</a> <a href="/wiki/1553.html" title="1553">1553</a>, Northumberland commanded senior judges to draw up a draft will for Edward. The plan was illegal for many reasons; firstly, a minor did not have the authority to make a will. Furthermore, Edward's will had not been authorised by any Act of Parliament, whilst Henry's will (which Northumberland sought to abrogate), had been specifically authorised by an Act passed in 1544. The judges at first resisted giving in to the Duke of Northumberland's demands, as it was treason to attempt to vary the laws of succession established in 1544. Edward, however, ensured their co-operation by promising a <a href="/wiki/Pardon.html" title="Pardon">pardon</a> under the <a href="/wiki/Great_Seal_of_the_Realm.html" title="Great Seal of the Realm">Great Seal</a>.</p>
<p>The first draft of the will excluded Mary, Elizabeth, the Duchess of Suffolk and the Lady Jane from the line of succession on the theory that no woman could rule England. The Crown was to be left to the Lady Jane's heirs-male. This plan, however, was not to Northumberland's liking (probably because Lady Jane had no male heirs at this time, having been married only a month or so before); the draft was changed to leave the Crown to Jane <i>and</i> her heirs-male. Mary and Elizabeth were excluded because they were officially illegitimate; the Duchess of Suffolk agreed to renounce her own claims. As Edward VI lay dying, the Duke of Northumberland (according to legend) symbolically stole the crown from him and gave it to his daughter-in-law, the Lady Jane.</p>

Edward's half sister and devout Catholic, Mary, succeeded him after the nine day reign of Lady Jane</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Mary was a very strong catholic and executed people who did not agree to become catholics like her.</p>
<p>Edward VI's death was kept secret for a couple of days so that preparations could be made for Jane's accession. High civic authorities privately swore their allegiance to the new <a href="/wiki/Queen_regnant.html" title="Queen regnant">Queen</a>, who was not publicly proclaimed until <a href="/wiki/July_10.html" title="July 10">10 July</a>. But the people were much more supportive of Mary, the rightful heir under the Act of Succession. On <a href="/wiki/July_19.html" title="July 19">19 July</a>, Mary rode triumphantly into <a href="/wiki/London.html" title="London">London</a>, and Jane was forced to give up the Crown. Jane's proclamation was revoked as an act done under coercion; her succession was deemed unlawful. Thus, Edward VI's <i>de jure</i> successor was Mary I (1553–58), but his <i>de facto</i> successor was Jane.</p>
<p>The Duke of Northumberland was executed, but the Lady Jane and her father were originally spared. In 1554, when Mary faced <a href="/wiki/Wyatt%27s_Rebellion.html" title="Wyatt's Rebellion">Wyatt's Rebellion</a>, the Duke of Suffolk once again attempted to put his daughter on the throne. For this crime, Jane, her husband and the Duke of Suffolk were executed.</p>
<p>After Edward VI's death at the age of fifteen, rumours of his survival persisted. To take advantage of the people's delusions, several impostors were put forward as rightful Kings. These impersonations continued throughout Mary I's reign, and even far into Elizabeth I's reign (1558–1603). Mistaken identities also feature in the <a href="/wiki/United_States.html" title="United States">American</a> author <a href="/wiki/Mark_Twain.html" title="Mark Twain">Mark Twain</a>'s novel, <i><a href="/wiki/The_Prince_and_the_Pauper.html" title="The Prince and the Pauper">The Prince and the Pauper</a></i>, in which the young Edward VI and a pauper boy of identical appearance accidentally replace each other.</p>
