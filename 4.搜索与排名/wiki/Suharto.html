<p><b>Haji Mohammad Soeharto</b> (born <a href="/wiki/June_8.html" title="June 8">June 8</a>, <a href="/wiki/1921.html" title="1921">1921</a>), more commonly referred to as simply <i>Soeharto</i> (<b>General Suharto</b> in the English-speaking world), is a former <a href="/wiki/Indonesia.html" title="Indonesia">Indonesian</a> military and political leader. He served as a military officer in the <a href="/wiki/Indonesian_National_Revolution.html" title="Indonesian National Revolution">Indonesian National Revolution</a>, but is better known as the long-reigning second <a href="/wiki/President_of_Indonesia.html" title="President of Indonesia">President of Indonesia</a>, holding the office from <a href="/wiki/1967.html" title="1967">1967</a> to <a href="/wiki/1998.html" title="1998">1998</a>.</p>
<p>Suharto seized power from his predecessor, the first president of Indonesia <a href="/wiki/Sukarno.html" title="Sukarno">Sukarno</a>, through a mixture of force and political maneuvering against the backdrop of foreign and domestic unrest. Over the three decades of his "New Order" regime, Suharto constructed a strong central government along <a href="/wiki/Militarist.html" title="Militarist">militarist</a> lines. An ability to maintain stability and an avowedly <a href="/wiki/Anti-Communist.html" title="Anti-Communist">anti-Communist</a> stance won him the economic and diplomatic patronage of several Western governments in the era of the <a href="/wiki/Cold_War.html" title="Cold War">Cold War</a>. For almost all of his three-decade rule, Indonesia experienced rapid <a href="/wiki/Industrialization.html" title="Industrialization">industrialization</a> and <a href="/wiki/Economic_growth.html" title="Economic growth">economic growth</a>.</p>
<p>In 1990's, the Suharto regime's increasingly <a href="/wiki/Authoritarian.html" title="Authoritarian">authoritarian</a> and <a href="/wiki/Political_corruption.html" title="Political corruption">corrupt</a> practices became a source of much discontent. His almost unquestioned authority over Indonesian affairs slipped dramatically when the <a href="/wiki/Asian_financial_crisis.html" title="Asian financial crisis">Asian financial crisis</a> lowered Indonesians' <a href="/wiki/Standard_of_living.html" title="Standard of living">standard of living</a> and fractured his support among the nation's military, political and civil society institutions. After internal unrest and diplomatic isolation sapped his support in the mid-to-late <a href="/wiki/1990s.html" title="1990s">1990s</a>, Suharto was forced to resign from the presidency in May <a href="/wiki/1998.html" title="1998">1998</a>.</p>
<p>After serving as the public face of Indonesia for over 30 years, Suharto now lives his post-presidential years in virtual seclusion. His legacy remains hotly debated and contested both in Indonesia and in foreign-policy debates in the West.</p>

<p><a name="Background_.26_career" id="Background_.26_career"></a></p>
<h2>Background &amp; career</h2>
<p>Suharto was born in the era of Dutch colonial control of Indonesia, in the hamlet of <a href="/wiki/Kemusuk.html" title="Kemusuk">Kemusuk</a>, a part of the larger village of Godean, 15 kilometres west of <a href="/wiki/Yogyakarta.html" title="Yogyakarta">Yogyakarta</a>, in central <a href="/wiki/Java_%28island%29.html" title="Java (island)">Java</a>. Escaping what was by many accounts a troubled childhood, he enrolled as a military officer in the Dutch military academy during at a time when the East Indies became a centre of several armed conflicts, including <a href="/wiki/World_War_II.html" title="World War II">World War II</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Indonesian_National_Revolution.html" title="Indonesian National Revolution">Indonesian National Revolution</a>. Like many natives in the military, Suharto was forced to change allegiances several times, but his training enabled him to become an asset to the side he finally settled upon, that of the Indonesian Nationalists.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: A troubled and mysterious childhood">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="A_troubled_and_mysterious_childhood" id="A_troubled_and_mysterious_childhood"></a></p>
<h3>A troubled and mysterious childhood</h3>
<p>The facts of the childhood and youth of Suharto, according to Western biographies, are steeped in both mystery and myth. Standard and apocryphal accounts of his early years and family life exist, many loaded with political meaning. What may be objectively known is that Suharto's parents, his mother Sukirah and father Kertosudiro, were ethnic-<a href="/wiki/Javanese.html" title="Javanese">Javanese</a> and <a href="/wiki/Peasant.html" title="Peasant">peasant</a> class, living in an area untouched by electricity or running water.</p>
<p>The early family life of Suharto is generally thought by scholarly sources to be unstable. His father Kertosudiro's marriage to Sukirah was his second; he already had two children from his previous marriage. Kertosudiro's marriage to Sukirah itself is believed to have ended in divorce early in Suharto's life, though exactly when is inconsistent - the account in Roeder's biography <i>The Smiling General</i> claims the divorce came within years of his birth; the account in Suharto's autobiography <i>Pirakan</i> states that it came within mere weeks.</p>
<p>The absence of official documentation, and certain aspects of Suharto's early life inconsistent with that of a Javanese peasant (such as that Suharto received an education fairly early on) has led to several rumors of Suharto being an illegitimate child of a well-off benefactor. These rumors include Suharto possibly being the child of a <a href="/wiki/Yogyakarta.html" title="Yogyakarta">Yogyakarta</a> aristocrat or well-off <a href="/wiki/Indonesian_Chinese.html" title="Indonesian Chinese">Indonesian Chinese</a> merchant. Though inconclusive, Western biographer <a href="/wiki/Robert_Elson.html" title="Robert Elson">R.E. Elson</a> believes that such rumors cannot be entirely ruled out, given that much of the information Suharto has given on his origins has been tinged with political meaning.</p>
<p>His parents divorced and re-married to new partners, Suharto was estranged from each (or both) of his parents for extended periods of time, bouncing around several households for much of his early life. The marriage of his paternal aunt to a low-level Javanese official named Prawirowiharjo, who took to raising Suharto as his own, is believed by Elson to have provided both a father-figure and role model for Suharto, as well as a stable home in <a  class="new" title="Wuryantoro">Wuryantoro</a>, where he received much of his primary education.</p>
<p>As noted by Elson and others, Suharto's upbringing stood in contrast with that of leading Nationalists such as Sukarno, in that he is believed to have had little interest in anti-colonialism, or political concerns beyond his immediate surroundings. He was also, unlike Sukarno and his circle, illiterate in <a href="/wiki/Dutch_language.html" title="Dutch language">Dutch</a> or other European languages. This would change, however, with Suharto's induction into the Dutch military in 1940.<sup id="_ref-ELSON1_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Pre-Independence military career">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Pre-Independence_military_career" id="Pre-Independence_military_career"></a></p>
<h3>Pre-Independence military career</h3>
<p>After a brief stint in a clerical job at a bank (from which he was fired), followed by a spell of unemployment, Suharto joined the <a href="/wiki/Royal_Netherlands_East_Indies_Army.html" title="Royal Netherlands East Indies Army">Royal Netherlands East Indies Army</a> (KNIL) in <a href="/wiki/1940.html" title="1940">1940</a>, and studied in a Dutch-run <a href="/wiki/Military_academy.html" title="Military academy">military academy</a> in <a  class="new" title="Gombong">Gombong</a> near Yogyakarta. This unusual opportunity for an indigenous colonial subject came as a result of the <a href="/wiki/Netherlands.html" title="Netherlands">Netherlands</a>' growing need for troops as <a href="/wiki/World_War_II.html" title="World War II">World War II</a> widened and the threat of an invasion by <a href="/wiki/Imperial_Japan.html" title="Imperial Japan">Imperial Japan</a> grew more likely.</p>
<p>After graduation, Suharto was assigned to Battalion XIII at Rampal. His service there was unextraordinary, but for his contracting <a href="/wiki/Malaria.html" title="Malaria">malaria</a> requiring hospitalization while on guard duty, and then gaining promotion to <a href="/wiki/Sergeant.html" title="Sergeant">sergeant</a>.<sup id="_ref-ELSON2_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>The invasion of Imperial Japanese forces and subsequent surrender of the Dutch forces led to Suharto's desertion from the Dutch and defection to the Japanese occupation force. He first joined the Japanese sponsored police force at the rank of <i>keibuho</i> (assistant inspector), where he claimed to have gained his first experience in the intelligence work so central to his presidency ("Criminal matters became a secondary problem," Suharto remarked, "what was most important were matters of a political kind")<sup id="_ref-OUDANG_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[3]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Suharto shifted from police work toward the Japanese-sponsored militia, the Peta (Defenders of the Fatherland) in which Indonesians served as officers. In his training to serve at the rank of <i>shodancho</i> (platoon commander) he encountered a localized version of the Japanese <i><a href="/wiki/Bushido.html" title="Bushido">bushido</a></i>, or "way of the warrior" , used to indoctrinate troops. This training encouraged an anti-Dutch and pro-nationalist thought, although toward the aims of the Imperial Japanese militarists. The encounter with a nationalistic and militarist ideology is believed to have profoundly influenced Suharto's own way of thinking.<sup id="_ref-ELSON3_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Service in the Indonesian National Revolution">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Service_in_the_Indonesian_National_Revolution" id="Service_in_the_Indonesian_National_Revolution"></a></p>
<h2>Service in the Indonesian National Revolution</h2>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Victory_over_Japan_Day.html" title="Victory over Japan Day">Japanese surrender</a> to the Allies in World War II brought forth the opportunity for the leaders of the Indonesian Nationalist cause <a href="/wiki/Sukarno.html" title="Sukarno">Sukarno</a> and <a href="/wiki/Mohammad_Hatta.html" title="Mohammad Hatta">Mohammad Hatta</a> to hastily declare the complete independence of Indonesia and the beginning of the <a href="/wiki/Indonesian_National_Revolution.html" title="Indonesian National Revolution">Indonesian National Revolution</a>. International recognition of Indonesia's sovereignty, however, would only come after armed action - a task at which Suharto would prove himself adept.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Expulsion of the Japanese">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Expulsion_of_the_Japanese" id="Expulsion_of_the_Japanese"></a></p>
<h3>Expulsion of the Japanese</h3>
<p>The Japanese surrender left Suharto in a position to create a name for himself as a part of the military effort to first expel the remaining Japanese forces, and to prepare nationalist forces for the Dutch attempt to retake their former colonial possessions in the archipelago. He became a deputy to <a  class="new" title="Umar Slamet">Umar Slamet</a> in the service of the revolutionary government's People's Security Body (BKR).</p>
<p>Suharto claims to have led a number of attacks against remaining Japanese forces around Yogyakarta. The central role he commonly portrayed himself playing in his reminisces on the period during his presidency is debatable; however, it may be acknowledged that Suharto's familiarity with military functioning helped in the organization of the disparate independence forces into a unified fighting force. In the early years of the Revolution, Suharto organized local armed forces into Battalion X of Regiment I; Suharto was promoted to the rank of Major and became Battalion X's leader.<sup id="_ref-ELSON4_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Return of the Dutch">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Return_of_the_Dutch" id="Return_of_the_Dutch"></a></p>
<h3>Return of the Dutch</h3>
<p>The arrival of the Allies, under a mandate to return the situation to the <i><a href="/wiki/Status_quo_ante_bellum.html" title="Status quo ante bellum">status quo ante bellum</a></i>, quickly led to clashes between Suharto's Division X and returning Dutch forces, bolstered by <a href="/wiki/Gurkha.html" title="Gurkha">Gurkhas</a> in the employ of Great Britain. Political differences within both the Allies and the civilian Nationalist forces caused the conflict to alternate in intensity from the end of <a href="/wiki/1945.html" title="1945">1945</a> into first months of <a href="/wiki/1946.html" title="1946">1946</a>, as negotiations went on between the leaderships of the Indonesian Nationalists and the Dutch in between periods of fighting. In this muddle, Suharto led his troops toward halting an advance by the Dutch T ("Tiger") Brigade on <a href="/wiki/May_17.html" title="May 17">17 May</a> <a href="/wiki/1946.html" title="1946">1946</a>. It earned Suharto the respect of his superior, Lieutenant Colonel Sunarto Kusumodirjo, who invited him to draft the working guidelines for the Battle Leadership Headquarters (MPP), a body created to organize and unify the command structure of the Indonesian Nationalist forces.<sup id="_ref-ELSON5_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>The military forces of the still infant Republic of Indonesia were constantly restructuring. By August <a href="/wiki/1946.html" title="1946">1946</a>, Suharto was head of the 22nd Regiment of Division III (the "<a href="/wiki/Diponegoro.html" title="Diponegoro">Diponegoro</a>" Division) stationed in Yogyakarta. In late <a href="/wiki/1946.html" title="1946">1946</a> the Diponegoro Division became responsible for defense of the west and south-west of Yogyakarta from Dutch forces. Conditions at the time are reported in Dutch sources as miserable; Suharto himself is reported as assisting smuggling syndicates in the transport of <a href="/wiki/Opium.html" title="Opium">opium</a> through the territory he controlled, in order to make income.</p>
<p>After a period of cooling down, the Dutch-Indonesian conflict flared up again in <a href="/wiki/1947.html" title="1947">1947</a> as the Dutch initiated <i>Operatie Product</i> ("Operation Product"), the first of its two <i><a href="/wiki/Politionele_acties.html" title="Politionele acties">Politionele acties</a></i> ("Police Actions") to recapture Indonesia. <i>Operatie Product</i> severely demoralized Indonesian forces, but diplomatic action in the <a href="/wiki/United_Nations.html" title="United Nations">United Nations</a> granted a respite from the fighting in order to resume negotiation. In the meantime, Suharto was married to Siti Hartinah, a woman of a high class family that in the years of the revolution lost its prestige and income. Over the next 17 years the couple would have six children: <a  class="new" title="Siti Hardiyanti Hastuti">Siti Hardiyanti Hastuti</a> (Tutut, born 1949), <a  class="new" title="Sigit Harjojudanto">Sigit Harjojudanto</a> (born 1951), <a  class="new" title="Bambang Trihatmodjo">Bambang Trihatmodjo</a> (born 1953), <a  class="new" title="Siti Hediati">Siti Hediati</a> (Titiek, born 1959), <a href="/wiki/Hutomo_Mandala_Putra.html" title="Hutomo Mandala Putra">Hutomo Mandala Putra</a> (Tommy, born 1962), and <a  class="new" title="Siti Hutami Endang Adiningsih">Siti Hutami Endang Adiningsih</a> (Mamiek, born 1964).</p>
<p>The Second Police Action, <i>Operatie Kraai</i> ("Operation Crow"), commenced in December <a href="/wiki/1948.html" title="1948">1948</a> and decimated much of the Indonesian fighting forces, resulting in the capture of Sukarno and Hatta, the civilian leadership of Indonesia. Suharto, for his part, took severe casualties as the Dutch invaded the area of Yogyakarta; the retreat was equally humiliating. <sup id="_ref-ELSON6_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[7]</a></sup></p>

<h3>Guerrilla warfare and victory</h3>
<p>It is widely believed that the humiliating nature of this defeat engrained a sense of guilt in Suharto, as well as a sense of obligation to avenge his honor. Suharto, and the aggrieved Indonesian armed forces, attempted to do this by means of <a href="/wiki/Guerrilla_warfare.html" title="Guerrilla warfare">guerrilla warfare</a>, using intelligence and supply networks established at the village level. During this time ambushes became a favored tactic; villagers were enlisted to attack Dutch patrols with weapons as primitive as bamboo spears. The desired effect was to remind the populace of the continuing resistance to Dutch rule. However, these attacks were largely ineffective and were often comparable to suicide.</p>
<p>Suharto's efforts to regain the national honor culminated in an attack on Dutch forces at Yogyakarta on <a href="/wiki/March_1.html" title="March 1">1 March</a> <a href="/wiki/1949.html" title="1949">1949</a>. Suharto would later embellish his role as the singular plotter; according to more objective sources, however, the nationalist Sultan Hamengku Buwono IX (who still remained in power), as well as the Panglima of the Third Division ordered the attack. General Nasution would recall, however, that Suharto took great care in preparing the "General Offensive" (<a href="/wiki/Bahasa_Indonesia.html" title="Bahasa Indonesia">Indonesian</a>" <i>Serangan Umum</i>).</p>
<p>In a series of daring small-scale raids under cover of darkness and with the support of locals, Suharto's forces captured the city, holding it until noon. The attack yielded some ammunition and a few light arms; as <a href="/wiki/Propaganda.html" title="Propaganda">propaganda</a> and <a href="/wiki/Psychological_warfare.html" title="Psychological warfare">psychological warfare</a> it had filled the desired effect, however - civilians sympathetic to the Nationalist cause within the city had been galvanized by the show of force, and internationally, the United Nations took notice, with the Security Council putting pressure on the Dutch to cease Police Action and to re-embark on negotiations. Suharto gained both national and international recognition of his abilities as a military planner.</p>
<p>The return of the Dutch to the negotiating table all but assured, Suharto took an active interest in the peace agreements, though they were much to his dissatisfaction.<sup id="_ref-ELSON7_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[8]</a></sup></p>

<p>On the morning of <a href="/wiki/October_1.html" title="October 1">October 1</a>, <a href="/wiki/1965.html" title="1965">1965</a>, a group of <a href="/wiki/Sukarno.html" title="Sukarno">Sukarno</a>'s closest guards kidnapped and murdered six of the right-wing anti-Communist generals. Sukarno's guards claimed that they were trying to stop a <a href="/wiki/Central_Intelligence_Agency.html" title="Central Intelligence Agency">CIA</a>-backed military coup which was planned to remove Sukarno from power on "Army Day", <a href="/wiki/October_5.html" title="October 5">October 5</a>. Suharto, at the time a Major General, joined surviving right-wing General <a href="/wiki/Abdul_Haris_Nasution.html" title="Abdul Haris Nasution">Abdul Haris Nasution</a> (once a Sukarno ally) in pointing the blame for the assassinations toward Sukarno loyalists and the Communist Party of Indonesia - a conspiracy they collectively dubbed the "30 September Movement" (<a href="/wiki/Bahasa_Indonesia.html" title="Bahasa Indonesia">Indonesian</a>: <i>Gerakan 30 September</i>). The group's name was more commonly abbreviated G30S, and propaganda would refer to the group by the epithet <i>Gestapu</i> (for its supposed similarity to the <a href="/wiki/Nazism.html" title="Nazism">Nazi</a> secret police the <a href="/wiki/Gestapo.html" title="Gestapo">Gestapo</a>).</p>

<h3>Crisis and opportunity</h3>
<p>Chaos and confusion surrounded the assassinations, but provided an opportunity for Suharto to rise within the army's ranks. At the time of the assassinations of the generals, Maj. Gen. Suharto and his Kostrad units were closest to the capital Jakarta; thus he became the field general in charge of prosecution of the alleged G30S forces. He gained further military powers through the intervention of the surviving right-wing Defense Minister and overall military Chief-of-Staff Gen. Abdul Haris Nasution, who forced President Sukarno to remove Maj. Gen. Pranoto Reksosamudra (seen as a leftist and Sukarno-loyalist) from the position of Army Chief-of-Staff, and to replace him with Maj. Gen. Suharto.<sup id="_ref-NYT_15OCT1965_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/October_18.html" title="October 18">18 October</a>, a declaration was read over the army-controlled radio stations, banning the Communist Party of Indonesia. The army, acting on orders by Suharto and supervised by Nasution, began a campaign of agitation and incitement to violence among Indonesian civilians aimed not only at Communists but the ethnic-Chinese community and toward President Sukarno himself.<sup id="_ref-NYT_19OCT1965_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[10]</a></sup> The resultant destabilization of the country left the Army the only force left to maintain order.</p>

<h3>Power struggle</h3>
<p>In the following months, as alleged Communists and Sukarno loyalists were killed and captured from the cities and villages, and liquidated from government, the <a href="/wiki/Troika_%28triumvirate%29.html" title="Troika (triumvirate)">troika</a> of Pres. Sukarno, Nasution, and Suharto jockeyed for power.<sup id="_ref-NYT_16DEC1965_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[11]</a></sup> Contemporary reports state that Sukarno was politically weak and desperate to keep power in the hands of his presidency by starting a factional struggle between Gen. Nasution and Suharto, while the two were absorbed in personal ambitions.</p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/February_1.html" title="February 1">1 February</a> <a href="/wiki/1966.html" title="1966">1966</a>, Pres. Sukarno promoted Suharto to the rank of Lieutenant General. The same month, Gen. Nasution had been forced out of his position of Defense Minister.<sup id="_ref-NYT_22FEB1966_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[12]</a></sup> The power contest had been boiled down to Suharto and Sukarno; with Sukarno in ill-health and politically isolated due to the removal of the PKI from the scene, Suharto had virtually assured himself the presidency.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Consequences">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Consequences" id="Consequences"></a></p>
<h3>Consequences</h3>
<p>Both supporters and critics of Suharto acknowledge that the period of civil war was marked by human rights abuses, with estimated civilian casualties ranging from hundreds of thousands to millions. Supporters of Suharto claim that these were justified due to the imminent threat of a PKI-led coup, citing the <a href="/wiki/1948.html" title="1948">1948</a> <a  class="new" title="Madiun Affair">Madiun Affair</a>, and that the Communist Party intended its peasant and workers' organizations to eventually become a fighting force.</p>
<p>Critics of Suharto claim that the PKI in <a href="/wiki/1965.html" title="1965">1965</a> had an inclination toward <a href="/wiki/Eurocommunism.html" title="Eurocommunism">Eurocommunism</a> and had come to prefer parliamentary electoral politics to armed insurrection; the party placed third in the <a href="/wiki/1955.html" title="1955">1955</a> presidential election behind Sukarno's own Partai Nasional Indonesia (PNI) and the Islamist party Masyumi. These critics allege that Suharto purposefully exaggerated PKI involvement in the assassinations of the generals, in order to justify the liquidation of this power bloc as well as to justify his repressive measures afterwards.</p>
<p>However brutal, Suharto's wresting of power away from the firebrand Sukarno brought a shift in policy that allowed for <a href="/wiki/USAID.html" title="USAID">USAID</a> and other relief agencies to resume operations within the country. Suharto would open Indonesia's economy by divesting state owned companies, and Western nations in particular were encouraged to invest and take control of many of the mining and construction interests in Indonesia. The result was the alleviation of <a href="/wiki/Famine.html" title="Famine">famine</a> conditions due to shortfalls in rice supply and Sukarno's reluctance to take Western aid, and stabilisation of the economy.</p>

Through this, Suharto established what he called the <a href="/wiki/New_Order_%28Indonesia%29.html" title="New Order (Indonesia)">New Order</a> (<i>Orde Baru</i>). He permanently banned the Communist Party of Indonesia and its alleged front groups, purging the <a href="/wiki/Parliament.html" title="Parliament">parliament</a> and cabinet of Sukarno loyalists, eliminating <a href="/wiki/Labor_union.html" title="Labor union">labor unions</a> and instituting press <a href="/wiki/Censorship.html" title="Censorship">censorship</a>.</p>

<h3>Institutionalisation of the New Order</h3>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/March_12.html" title="March 12">March 12</a>, <a href="/wiki/1967.html" title="1967">1967</a> Sukarno was stripped of his remaining power by Indonesia's provisional Parliament, led by Nasution. Suharto was named Acting President. On <a href="/wiki/March_21.html" title="March 21">March 21</a>, <a href="/wiki/1968.html" title="1968">1968</a> he was formally elected for the first of his five-year terms as President.</p>
<p>To maintain order, Suharto greatly expanded the funding and powers of the Indonesian state apparatus. He established two intelligence agencies—the Operational Command for the Restoration of Security and Order (KOPKAMTIB) and the State Intelligence Coordination Agency (BAKIN)—to deal with threats to the regime. Suharto also established the <a href="/wiki/BULOG.html" title="BULOG">Bureau of Logistics (BULOG)</a> to distribute <a href="/wiki/Rice.html" title="Rice">rice</a> and other staple commodities granted by <a href="/wiki/USAID.html" title="USAID">USAID</a>. These new government bodies were put under the military regional command structure, that under Suharto was given a "dual function" as both a defense force and as civilian administrators.</p>
<p>On economic matters, President Suharto relied on a group of American-educated economists, nicknamed the "<a href="/wiki/Berkeley_Mafia.html" title="Berkeley Mafia">Berkeley Mafia</a>," to set policy. Soon after coming to power, he passed a number of reforms meant to establish Indonesia as a center of foreign investment. These included the privatization of its <a href="/wiki/Natural_resources.html" title="Natural resources">natural resources</a> to promote their exploitation by industrialized nations, labour laws favorable to multinational corporations, and soliciting funds for development from institutions including the <a href="/wiki/World_Bank.html" title="World Bank">World Bank</a>, Western banks, and friendly governments. <sup id="_ref-IND_ECON_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[13]</a></sup></p>
<p>As virtually unchecked forces in Indonesian society under the New Order, however, members of the military and Golkar Party were heavily involved as intermediaries between businesses (foreign and domestic) and the Indonesian government. This led to bribery, racketeering, and embezzlement. Funds from these practices often flowed to foundations (<i>yayasan</i>) controlled by the Suharto family. <sup id="_ref-KKN_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[14]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>From his assumption of office until his resignation, Suharto continued Sukarno's policy of asserting Indonesian sovereignty. He acted zealously to stake and enforce territorial claims over much of the region, through both diplomacy and military action.</p>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/1969.html" title="1969">1969</a>, Suharto moved to end the longtime controversy over the last Dutch territory in the East Indies, <a href="/wiki/Western_New_Guinea.html" title="Western New Guinea">western New Guinea</a>. Working with the <a href="/wiki/United_States.html" title="United States">United States</a> and <a href="/wiki/United_Nations.html" title="United Nations">United Nations</a>, an agreement was made to hold a referendum on self-determination, in which participants could choose to remain part of the Netherlands, to integrate with the Republic of Indonesia, or to become independent.

The unanimous vote was for integration with the Republic of Indonesia, leading to doubts of the validity of the vote.<sup id="_ref-NSArch_Simpson_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[15]</a></sup></p>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/1975.html" title="1975">1975</a>, after <a href="/wiki/Portugal.html" title="Portugal">Portugal</a> withdrew from its colony of <a href="/wiki/East_Timor.html" title="East Timor">East Timor</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Fretilin.html" title="Fretilin">Fretilin</a> movement momentarily took power, Suharto ordered troops to invade the country. Later the <a href="/wiki/Puppet_government.html" title="Puppet government">puppet government</a> installed by Indonesia requested the area be annexed to the country. It was estimated that 200,000 people, roughly a third of the local population, were killed by the Indonesian forces or affiliated proxy forces. On <a href="/wiki/July_15.html" title="July 15">July 15</a>, <a href="/wiki/1976.html" title="1976">1976</a> East Timor became the province of Timor Timur until it was transferred to the <a href="/wiki/United_Nations.html" title="United Nations">United Nations</a> in <a href="/wiki/1999.html" title="1999">1999</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/1976.html" title="1976">1976</a>, the regime was challenged in the province of <a href="/wiki/Aceh.html" title="Aceh">Aceh</a> by the formation of the <a href="/wiki/Free_Aceh_Movement.html" title="Free Aceh Movement">Free Aceh Movement</a>, or GAM, who demanded independence from the unitary state.

<p>Underpinning Suharto's territorial ambitions was the rapid development of Indonesia's traditional urban centers. The rapid pace of this development had vastly increased their population density. In response, Suharto pursued the policy of <a href="/wiki/Transmigration_program.html" title="Transmigration program">transmigration</a> to promote movement from crowded cities to rural regions of the archipelago where <a href="/wiki/Natural_resources.html" title="Natural resources">natural resources</a> had not yet been exploited.</p>

<p>In <a href="/wiki/1970.html" title="1970">1970</a>, corruption prompted student protests and an investigation by a government commission. Suharto responded by banning student protests, forcing the activists underground. Only token prosecution of the cases recommended by the commission was pursued. The pattern of co-opting a few of his more powerful opponents while criminalising the rest became a hallmark of Suharto's rule.</p>
<p>In order to maintain a veneer of democracy, Suharto made a number of electoral reforms. According to his electoral rules, however, only three parties were allowed to participate in the election: his own <a href="/wiki/Golkar.html" title="Golkar">Golkar</a> party; the Islamist <a href="/wiki/United_Development_Party.html" title="United Development Party">United Development Party</a> (PPP); and the <a href="/wiki/Indonesian_Democratic_Party.html" title="Indonesian Democratic Party">Democratic Party of Indonesia</a> (PDI). All the previously existing political parties were forced to be part of either the PPP and PDI, with public servants under pressure to join Golkar. In a political compromise with the powerful military, he banned its members from voting in elections, but set aside 100 seats in the electoral college for their representatives. As a result, he was unopposed for reelection as president in <a href="/wiki/1973.html" title="1973">1973</a>, <a href="/wiki/1978.html" title="1978">1978</a>, <a href="/wiki/1983.html" title="1983">1983</a>, <a href="/wiki/1988.html" title="1988">1988</a>, <a href="/wiki/1993.html" title="1993">1993</a>, and <a href="/wiki/1998.html" title="1998">1998</a>.</p>

<p>In the same decade, it is believed by many scholars that the Indonesian military split between a nationalist "red and white faction" and an Islamist "green faction." As the <a href="/wiki/1980s.html" title="1980s">1980s</a> closed, Suharto is said to have been forced to shift his alliances from the former to the latter, leading to the rise of <a href="/wiki/Jusuf_Habibie.html" title="Jusuf Habibie">Jusuf Habibie</a> in the <a href="/wiki/1990s.html" title="1990s">1990s</a>.</p>
<p>After the <a href="/wiki/1990s.html" title="1990s">1990s</a> brought end of the Cold War, Western concern over communism waned, and Suharto's human rights record came under greater international scrutiny.

In a televised speech, Suharto announces his resignation as President of Indonesia. Beside him is his Vice-President and successor Jusuf Habibie.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/1996.html" title="1996">1996</a> Suharto was challenged by a split over the leadership of the <a href="/wiki/Indonesian_Democratic_Party.html" title="Indonesian Democratic Party">Indonesian Democratic Party</a> (PDI), a legal party that propped up the regime. <a href="/wiki/Megawati_Sukarnoputri.html" title="Megawati Sukarnoputri">Megawati Sukarnoputri</a>, the daughter of <a href="/wiki/Sukarno.html" title="Sukarno">Sukarno</a>, had become PDI's chairwoman and was increasingly critical of Suharto's regime. In response, Suharto backed a co-opted faction led by Deputy Speaker of Parliament <a  class="new" title="Suryadi">Suryadi</a>. The Suryadi faction announced a party congress to sack Megawati would be held in <a href="/wiki/Medan.html" title="Medan">Medan</a> <a href="/wiki/June_20.html" title="June 20">June 20</a> - <a href="/wiki/June_22.html" title="June 22">22</a>.</p>
<p>In response, Megawati proclaimed that if sacked, her supporters would hold demonstrations in protest. The Suryadi faction went through with its sacking of Megawati, and the demonstrations manifested themselves throughout Indonesia. This led to several confrontations on the streets between protesters and security forces. A deal was eventually made with the military to allow Megawati's supporters to take over PDI headquarters in Jakarta, in exchange for a pledge of no further demonstrations. During this time, Megawati supporters organized "democracy forums" at the site, with several activists making speeches denouncing Suharto and his regime. <sup id="_ref-ASPINALL_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[19]</a></sup></p>
<p>After one month of this, police, soldiers, and persons claiming to be Suryadi supporters stormed the headquarters, killing Megawati supporters and arresting two-hundred. Those arrested were tried under the Anti-Subversion and Hate-spreading laws. <sup id="_ref-AMNESTYREP_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[20]</a></sup>The day would become known as "Black Saturday" and mark the beginning of a renewed crackdown by the New Order government against supporters of democracy, now called the "Reformasi" or Reformation.</p>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/1997.html" title="1997">1997</a> <a href="/wiki/Asian_financial_crisis.html" title="Asian financial crisis">Asian financial crisis</a> had dire consequences for the Indonesian economy and society, and Suharto's regime. The Indonesian <a href="/wiki/Currency.html" title="Currency">currency</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Rupiah.html" title="Rupiah">rupiah</a>, took a sharp dive in value. Suharto came under scrutiny from international lending institutions, chiefly the <a href="/wiki/World_Bank.html" title="World Bank">World Bank</a>, <a href="/wiki/IMF.html" title="IMF">IMF</a> and the <a href="/wiki/United_States.html" title="United States">United States</a>, over longtime embezzlement of funds and some <a href="/wiki/Protectionist.html" title="Protectionist">protectionist</a> policies. In December, Suharto's government signed a letter of intent to the <a href="/wiki/IMF.html" title="IMF">IMF</a>, pledging to enact <a href="/wiki/Austerity.html" title="Austerity">austerity</a> measures, including cuts to public services and removal of <a href="/wiki/Subsidies.html" title="Subsidies">subsidies</a>, in return for receiving the aid of the <a href="/wiki/IMF.html" title="IMF">IMF</a> and other donors.</p>
<p>Beginning in early <a href="/wiki/1998.html" title="1998">1998</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Austerity.html" title="Austerity">austerity</a> measures approved by Suharto had started to erode domestic confidence in the regime. Prices for <a href="/wiki/Commodities.html" title="Commodities">commodities</a> such as kerosene and rice, and fees for public services including education rose dramatically. The effects were exacerbated by widespread corruption.</p>
<p>Suharto stood for reelection for the seventh time in March <a href="/wiki/1998.html" title="1998">1998</a>, justifying it on the grounds of the necessity of his leadership during the crisis. As in past years, he was unopposed for reelection. This sparked protests and riots throughout the country, now termed the <a href="/wiki/Indonesian_Revolution_of_1998.html" title="Indonesian Revolution of 1998">Indonesian Revolution of 1998</a>. Dissension within the ranks of his own Golkar party and military finally weakened Suharto, and on <a href="/wiki/May_21.html" title="May 21">May 21</a> he stood down from power. He was replaced by his deputy <a href="/wiki/Jusuf_Habibie.html" title="Jusuf Habibie">Jusuf Habibie</a>.</p>

After his fall from the presidency, Suharto's secret fortune began to be publicized in the press.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Since his resignation, Suharto has retired to a family compound in Central Jakarta, making few public appearances. Efforts to prosecute Suharto have mostly centered around alleged mismanagement of funds, and their force has been blunted due to health concerns.</p>

<h3>Investigations of wealth</h3>
<p>In May <a href="/wiki/1999.html" title="1999">1999</a>, a <a href="/wiki/Time_%28magazine%29.html" title="Time (magazine)"><i>Time Asia</i></a> estimated Suharto's family fortune at US$15 billion in cash, <a href="/wiki/Shares.html" title="Shares">shares</a>, corporate assets, real estate, jewelery and fine art. Of this, US$9 billion is reported to have been deposited in an <a href="/wiki/Austria.html" title="Austria">Austrian</a> bank. The family is said to control about 36,000 km² of real estate in Indonesia, including 100,000 m² of prime office space in Jakarta and nearly 40 percent of the land in East Timor. Over US$73 billion is said to have passed through the family's hands during Suharto's 32-year rule.</p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/May_29.html" title="May 29">May 29</a>, <a href="/wiki/2000.html" title="2000">2000</a>, Suharto was placed under <a href="/wiki/House_arrest.html" title="House arrest">house arrest</a> when Indonesian authorities began to investigate the corruption during his regime. In July, it was announced that he was to be accused of embezzling US$571 million of government donations to one of a number of foundations under his control and then using the money to finance family investments. But in September court-appointed doctors announced that he could not stand trial because of his declining health. State prosecutors tried again in <a href="/wiki/2002.html" title="2002">2002</a> but then doctors cited an unspecified brain disease.</p>
<p>According to <a href="/wiki/Transparency_International.html" title="Transparency International">Transparency International</a>, Suharto <a href="/wiki/Embezzlement.html" title="Embezzlement">embezzled</a> more money than any other world leader in history.<sup id="_ref-TISuharto_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[21]</a></sup></p>

<p>Since resigning from the presidency, Suharto has been hospitalized repeatedly for <a href="/wiki/Cerebrovascular_accident.html" title="Cerebrovascular accident">stroke</a>, heart, and intestinal problems. These conditions have affected the many attempts to prosecute Suharto on charges of corruption and human rights violations, as his lawyers have repeatedly and successfully claimed that the conditions render him unfit for trial. Various opponents and aggreived parties have charged that Suharto is <a href="/wiki/Malingering.html" title="Malingering">malingering</a>, and complained of the hypocrisy of the mercy shown toward him.</p>

<p>On <a href="/wiki/May_6.html" title="May 6">6 May</a> <a href="/wiki/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>, Suharto was taken to Pertamina Hospital in Jakarta with intestinal bleeding, believed to be from <a href="/wiki/Diverticulosis.html" title="Diverticulosis">diverticulosis</a>. The political elite of Indonesia, including President <a href="/wiki/Susilo_Bambang_Yudhoyono.html" title="Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono">Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono</a> and Vice President <a href="/wiki/Jusuf_Kalla.html" title="Jusuf Kalla">Jusuf Kalla</a>, visited his bedside. He was released and returned home, <a href="/wiki/May_12.html" title="May 12">May 12</a>, 2005.</p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/May_26.html" title="May 26">26 May</a> <a href="/wiki/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>, the Jakarta Post reported that amid an effort by the government of President <a href="/wiki/Susilo_Bambang_Yudhoyono.html" title="Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono">Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono</a> to crack down on corruption, Indonesian Attorney General Abdurrahman Saleh appeared before a Parliamentary commission to discuss efforts to prosecute New Order figures, including Suharto. Attorney General Abdurrahman remarked that he hoped Suharto could recover so that the government could begin inquiries into New Order human rights violations and corruption for purposes of compensation and recovery of state funds, but expressed skepticism that this would be possible. As a result, the Supreme Court of Indonesia has issued a decree making the office of the Attorney General responsible for supervising Suharto's medical care.</p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/April_24.html" title="April 24">24 April</a> <a href="/wiki/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>, Attorney General Abdurrahman announced that a team of twenty doctors would be asked to evaluate Suharto's health and fitness for trial.

<p>On <a href="/wiki/May_4.html" title="May 4">4 May</a> <a href="/wiki/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>, Suharto was again admitted to Pertamina Hospital for intestinal bleeding.

<h3>Related legal cases</h3>
<p>Unable to prosecute Suharto, the state has instead pursued legal actions against his former subordinates and members of his family. Suharto's son Hutomo Mandala Putra, more widely known as <a href="/wiki/Tommy_Suharto.html" title="Tommy Suharto">Tommy Suharto</a>, was initially sentenced to fifteen years in jail for arranging the murder of a judge who sentenced him to eighteen months for his role in a land scam in September <a href="/wiki/2000.html" title="2000">2000</a>. He became the first member of the Suharto family to be found guilty and jailed for a criminal offence. Tommy Suharto maintained his innocence, and won a reduction of his sentence to ten years in <a href="/wiki/June_2005.html" title="June 2005">June 2005</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a>, Suharto's half-brother Probosutedjo was tried and convicted for corrupt practices that lost a total of $10 million from the Indonesian state. He was sentenced to four years in jail. He later won a reduction of his sentence to two years, initiating a probe by the Indonesian Corruption Eradication Commission into the alleged scandal of the "judicial mafia" which uncovered offers of $600,000 to various judges. Probosutedjo confessed to the scheme in <a href="/wiki/October_2005.html" title="October 2005">October 2005</a>, leading to the arrest of his lawyers. He later had his full four year term reinstated. After a brief standoff at a hospital, in which he was reportedly protected by a group of police officers, he was arrested on <a href="/wiki/November_30.html" title="November 30">30 November</a> <a href="/wiki/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>.</p>
