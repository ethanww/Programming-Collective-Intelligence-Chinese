<p>A <b>Baptist</b> is a member of a Baptist church or a person who believes in the practice of baptism by immersion into water. Baptist churches are often regarded as an <a href="/wiki/Evangelicalism.html" title="Evangelicalism">Evangelical</a> <a href="/wiki/Protestant.html" title="Protestant">Protestant</a> <a href="/wiki/Religious_denomination.html" title="Religious denomination">denomination</a> originating from the English <a href="/wiki/Puritan.html" title="Puritan">Puritan</a> movement with <a href="/wiki/Anabaptist.html" title="Anabaptist">Anabaptist</a> influences. However there are disagreements with these labels and origins views (See "Questions of labelling" and "Origins")</p>
<p>Theologically many Baptists emphasize a <a href="/wiki/Believer%27s_baptism.html" title="Believer's baptism">believer's baptism</a> by full immersion, which is performed on non-infants after a profession of faith in <a href="/wiki/Jesus.html" title="Jesus">Jesus</a> as Lord and Savior. A <a href="/wiki/Congregational.html" title="Congregational">congregational</a> governance system gives autonomy to individual local Baptist churches.

<p>Baptist churches do not have a central governing authority, resulting in the wide range of beliefs from one Baptist church to another. Baptist distinctives are beliefs that are common among Baptist churches, some of which are also shared with many other <a href="/wiki/Protestant_Reformation.html" title="Protestant Reformation">post-reformational</a> denominations. Some historically significant Baptist doctrinal documents include the <a href="/wiki/1689_London_Baptist_Confession_of_Faith.html" title="1689 London Baptist Confession of Faith">1689 London Baptist Confession of Faith</a>, the <a href="/wiki/1833_New_Hampshire_Baptist_Confession_of_Faith.html" title="1833 New Hampshire Baptist Confession of Faith">1833 New Hampshire Baptist Confession of Faith</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/Southern_Baptist_Convention.html" title="Southern Baptist Convention">Southern Baptist Convention</a>'s <a href="/wiki/Baptist_Faith_and_Message.html" title="Baptist Faith and Message">Baptist Faith and Message</a>, which are often used as the "official" doctrinal statements of individual local Baptist churches or the starting point for an official statement.</p>

<li><b>P</b>riesthood of all believers (1 Peter 2:5-9; 1 Timothy 5)</li>
<li><b>T</b>wo ordinances (baptism and the Lord's Supper) (Acts 2:41-47; 1 Corinthians 11:23-32)</li>
<li><b>I</b>ndividual soul liberty (Romans 14:5-12)</li>
<li><b>S</b>eparation of Church and State (<a  class="external text" title="http://php.ug.cs.usyd.edu.au/~jnot4610/bibref.php?book=%20Matthew&amp;verse=22:15-22&amp;src=31">Matthew 22:15-22</a>)</li>
<li><b>T</b>wo offices of the church (pastor and deacon) (I Timothy 3:1-13; Titus 1-2)</li>
</ul>
<p>Some Baptist traditions adhere to the "Four Freedoms" articulated by Baptist historian Walter B. Shurden.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Soul freedom</b>: the soul is competent before God, and capable of making decisions in matters of faith without coercion or compulsion by any larger religious or civil body</li>
<li><b>Church freedom</b>: freedom of the local church from outside interference, whether government or civilian (subject only to the law where it does not interfere with the religious teachings and practices of the church)</li>
<li><b>Bible freedom</b>: the individual is free to interpret the Bible for himself or herself, using the best tools of scholarship and Biblical study available to the individual</li>
<li><b>Religious freedom</b>: the individual is free to choose whether to practice their religion, another religion, or no religion; <a href="/wiki/Separation_of_church_and_state.html" title="Separation of church and state">Separation of church and state</a> is often called the "civil corollary" of religious freedom</li>

<p><a name="Biblical_authority" id="Biblical_authority"></a></p>
<h3>Biblical authority</h3>
<p>Baptists emphasize authority of the Scriptures, or <a href="/wiki/Sola_scriptura.html" title="Sola scriptura">sola scriptura</a>, and therefore believe that the Bible is the only authoritative source of God's truth. This view contrasts with the role of Apostolic tradition in the Roman Catholic Church and personal revelation in <a href="/wiki/Charismatic_movement.html" title="Charismatic movement">charismatic</a> circles. Any view that cannot be tied to scriptural exposition is generally considered to be based on human traditions rather than God's leading, and though they may be accurate, such views are never to be elevated to or above the authority of Scripture. Each person is responsible before God for his or her own understanding of the Bible and is encouraged to work out their own salvation. A common "proof text" for this idea is found in Phillipians 2:12<a  class="external autonumber" title="http://bible1.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?word=Philippians+2%3A12&amp;section=0&amp;version=kjv&amp;new=1&amp;oq=&amp;NavBook=php&amp;NavGo=2%3A1&amp;NavCurrentChapter=2">[2]</a>.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Biblical_inerrancy.html" title="Biblical inerrancy">Biblical inerrancy</a> is also a common position held by <a href="/wiki/Fundamentalism.html" title="Fundamentalism">fundamentalist</a> Baptists in addition to contextually literal interpretations of the Bible and other fundamentalist theologies. Many Baptists are neither literalist nor fundamentalist, although most believe in biblical authority. Moderate, non-fundamentalist baptists prefer the term <i>inspired</i> or <i>God-breathed</i> rather than <i>inerrant</i> to describe scripture, referring to the term Paul uses in 2 Timothy 3:16.</p>
<p>Baptists generally consider historic Christian <a href="/wiki/Creed.html" title="Creed">creeds</a> to be on lower footing in comparison to Scripture, even though they may in essence agree with them. However, a group or local church may have a general statement of faith such as the <a href="/wiki/Baptist_Faith_and_Message.html" title="Baptist Faith and Message">Baptist Faith and Message</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Southern_Baptist_Convention.html" title="Southern Baptist Convention">Southern Baptist Convention</a> or the Mission Statement of the <a href="/wiki/Alliance_of_Baptists.html" title="Alliance of Baptists">Alliance of Baptists</a>. Baptists also cite other works as illustrative of doctrine.

Baptist churches are not under the direct administrative control of any other body, such as a national council, or a leader such as a bishop or pope. Administration, leadership and doctrine are usually decided democratically by the lay members of each individual church, which accounts for the variation of beliefs from one Baptist church to another.</p>
<p>Exceptions are some <a href="/wiki/Reformed_Baptist.html" title="Reformed Baptist">Reformed Baptists</a>, who are organized in a <a href="/wiki/Presbyterian_polity.html" title="Presbyterian polity">Presbyterian</a> system and the <a href="/wiki/Congolese.html" title="Congolese">Congolese</a> <a  class="new" title="Episcopal Baptist">Episcopal Baptists</a> that has an <a href="/wiki/Episcopal.html" title="Episcopal">Episcopal</a> system. Some Baptist <a href="/wiki/Megachurch.html" title="Megachurch">megachurches</a> lean towards a strong clergy-led style, whereby the membership has little or no oversight into the affairs of the church leadership; though this does not strictly follow the practice of congregationalist church governance it is consistent with the principles of church autonomy.</p>
<p>In a manner typical of other congregationalists, many cooperative associations or conventions of Baptists have arisen. These associations were formed for missionary and other charitable work and have no authority over the operations of individual local churches. Local churches decide at what level they will participate in these associations.</p>
<p>Today 70% of all Baptists reside in the United States which participate in several associations. The largest association is the <a href="/wiki/Southern_Baptist_Convention.html" title="Southern Baptist Convention">Southern Baptist Convention</a> which typically has a <a href="/wiki/Fundamentalist.html" title="Fundamentalist">fundamentalist</a> theological orientation, though ironically the Southern Baptists have been commonly criticized by independent fundamentalist Baptists for being not fundamentalist enough. The other primary association that descended from the Triennial Convention founded in 1814 is the <a href="/wiki/American_Baptist_Churches_USA.html" title="American Baptist Churches USA">American Baptist Churches USA</a> which is a <a href="/wiki/Mainline.html" title="Mainline">mainline</a> denomination.

There are hundreds of Baptist conventions and many <a href="/wiki/Independent_Baptist.html" title="Independent Baptist">Independent Baptist</a> churches do not fall into any of them, believing such associations to be unscriptural. In addition, there are sometimes very strong disputes within conventions which are often divided between <a href="/wiki/Christian_fundamentalist.html" title="Christian fundamentalist">Christian fundamentalists</a> and moderates.</p>

<h3>Priesthood of all believers</h3>
<p>The doctrine of "<a href="/wiki/Priesthood_of_all_believers.html" title="Priesthood of all believers">priesthood of all believers</a>" states that every Christian has direct access to God and the truths found in the Bible, without the help of an aristocracy or hierarchy of priests. This doctrine is based on the passage found in <a  class="external text" title="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Peter%202:9;&amp;version=31;50;9;">1 Peter 2:9</a> and was popularized by <a href="/wiki/Martin_Luther.html" title="Martin Luther">Martin Luther</a> during the <a href="/wiki/Protestant_Reformation.html" title="Protestant Reformation">Protestant Reformation</a> and <a href="/wiki/John_Wycliff.html" title="John Wycliff">John Wycliff</a>'s <a href="/wiki/Lollards.html" title="Lollards">Lollards</a> before Luther.</p>
<p>Baptists are encouraged to discuss scriptural and other issues with their minister and other Christians when appropriate.

<h3>Two sacraments (Baptism and Communion)</h3>
<p>Generally, most Baptist churches recognize only two sacraments or ordinances that are to be performed on a regular basis by churches: <a href="/wiki/Baptism.html" title="Baptism">baptism</a> and <a href="/wiki/Eucharist.html" title="Eucharist">communion</a>.

<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Believer's baptism">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Believer.27s_baptism" id="Believer.27s_baptism"></a></p>
<h4>Believer's baptism</h4>
<p>Baptism, commonly referred to as <a href="/wiki/Believer%27s_baptism.html" title="Believer's baptism">believer's baptism</a> among Baptists, is an ordinance that according to Baptist doctrine plays no role in salvation, being properly performed only after salvation, and is performed after a person professes Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior. It is an outward expression that is symbolic of the inward cleansing or remission of their sins that has already taken place. It is also a public identification of that person with Christianity and with that particular local church. Most Baptist churches consider baptism by full immersion, subsequent to salvation, a criterion for membership.</p>
<p>Through <a href="/wiki/Anabaptist.html" title="Anabaptist">Anabaptist</a> influence, Baptists reject the practice of <a href="/wiki/Pedobaptism.html" title="Pedobaptism">pedobaptism</a> or infant baptism because they believe parents cannot make a decision of salvation for an infant. Related to this doctrine is the disputed concept of an "<a href="/wiki/Coming_of_age#Christianity.html" title="Coming of age">age of accountability</a>" when God determines that a mentally capable person is accountable for their sins and eligible for baptism. This is not necessarily a specific age, but is based on whether or not the person is mentally capable of knowing right from wrong. Thus, a person with severe mental retardation may never reach this age, and therefore would not be held accountable for sins. The book of <a href="/wiki/Isaiah.html" title="Isaiah">Isaiah</a> mentions an age at which a child "shall know to refuse the evil, and choose the good" but does not specify what that age is.</p>
<p>Baptists insist upon baptism by full immersion, the mode presumed to have been used by <a href="/wiki/John_the_Baptist.html" title="John the Baptist">John the Baptist</a>. This consists of lowering the candidate in water backwards while the baptizer (a pastor or any baptised believer) invokes the Trinitarian formula of <a  class="external text" title="http://php.ug.cs.usyd.edu.au/~jnot4610/bibref.php?book=%20Matthew&amp;verse=28:19&amp;src=31">Matthew 28:19</a> or other words concerning a profession of faith. This mode is also preferred for its parallel imagery to the death, burial, and resurrection of <a href="/wiki/Jesus.html" title="Jesus">Jesus</a>.</p>
<p>Recognition of baptisms by other modes and Christian groups vary. Many Baptist churches only recognize baptism by full immersion as being valid, while a few will baptise by sprinkling as a practical alternative for the disabled or elderly or in times of drought. Some Baptist churches will recognize adult baptisms by immersion performed in other orthodox Christian churches, while others only recognize baptisms performed in Baptist churches. In rare instances, a church may recognize only its own baptisms as valid.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Communion (The Lord's Supper)">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Communion_.28The_Lord.27s_Supper.29" id="Communion_.28The_Lord.27s_Supper.29"></a></p>
<h4>Communion (The Lord's Supper)</h4>
<p>Communion, which is alternatively called "<a href="/wiki/The_Lord%27s_Supper.html" title="The Lord's Supper">The Lord's Supper</a>" or Eucharist (some Baptists avoid the use of the word Communion due to its prominent use by the <a href="/wiki/Roman_Catholic_Church.html" title="Roman Catholic Church">Roman Catholic Church</a> and instead use the alternative name), is a sacrament or ordinance patterned after the <a href="/wiki/Last_Supper.html" title="Last Supper">Last Supper</a> recorded in the <a href="/wiki/Gospels.html" title="Gospels">Gospels</a> in which Jesus says to "this do in remembrance of me" (Luke 22:19). Participants communally eat the bread and drink the cup that are representative of the body and blood of Jesus. Baptists emphasize that the remembrance is symbolic of Christ's body and reject literal views of communion such as <a href="/wiki/Transubstantiation.html" title="Transubstantiation">transubstantiation</a> and <a href="/wiki/Consubstantiation.html" title="Consubstantiation">consubstantiation</a> held by other Christian groups based on their interpretation of John 6. The passage 1 Corinthians 11:23-34 is also commonly cited as instructional for the practice of Communion.</p>
<p>The bread used in the service may be cubes of unleavened bread, wafers or small crackers, generally of an unleavened variety which is thought to be the type used at the Last Supper. Some Baptist groups embraced the <a href="/wiki/Temperance_movement.html" title="Temperance movement">Temperance movement</a>, <a href="/wiki/Prohibition.html" title="Prohibition">prohibition</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Teetotalism.html" title="Teetotalism">teetotalism</a> in the U.S. which led to the practice in some churches of using non-alcoholic grape juice for the cup, but most Baptists do use wine. The wine is typically served in small individual glasses, though some churches use one large cup for the entire congregation. Many church buildings are equipped with round receptacles on the rear of the pews for depositing the empty glasses after the service. Both elements of the bread and the cup are usually served by the pastor to the deacons, and by the deacons to the congregation. A deacon will serve the pastor, or if the church has multiple pastors they will serve each other. The general practice is for the elements to be taken by the congregation as a whole as a symbol of unity, first the bread and then the cup separately, although sometimes both elements are taken together.</p>

<h3>Individual soul liberty</h3>
<p>The basic concept of individual soul liberty is that, in matters of religion, each person has the liberty to choose what his/her conscience or soul dictates is right, and is responsible to no one but God for the decision that is made. A person may then choose to be a Baptist, a member of another Christian denomination, an adherent to another world religion, or to choose no religious belief system, and neither the church, nor the government, nor family or friends may either make the decision or compel the person to choose otherwise.

<p>The original objection was opposition of the monarchy or government setting religious agenda for churches or a "National Church" and did not imply a retreat by Christians from the political realm or involvement in the political process. Modern debates about church and state separation involve disagreements about the extent to which Christian groups are able to, or should, set the legal and moral agenda for the government, and conversely whether government is preventing Christians and Christian groups from equal access to public forums.</p>

<p><a name="Two_offices_.28Pastor_and_Deacon.29" id="Two_offices_.28Pastor_and_Deacon.29"></a></p>
<h3>Two offices (Pastor and Deacon)</h3>
<p>Generally Baptists only recognize two Scriptural offices, those of <a href="/wiki/Pastor.html" title="Pastor">pastor</a>-teacher and <a href="/wiki/Deacon.html" title="Deacon">deacon</a>. The office of <a href="/wiki/Elder_%28religious%29.html" title="Elder (religious)">elder</a>, common in some <a href="/wiki/Evangelicalism.html" title="Evangelicalism">evangelical</a> churches, is usually considered by Baptists to be the same as that of pastor, and not a separate office; however, some churches, especially those in other countries such as Australia, acknowledge the position of elder, and others even dispose of the position of deacon altogether. The office of overseer or <a href="/wiki/Bishop.html" title="Bishop">bishop</a> is always considered to be the same as that of pastor or <a href="/wiki/Presbyter.html" title="Presbyter">presbyter</a>. Some Southern Baptist and other Baptistic churches may ordain bishops over small regional groups of churches.</p>
<p>The prevalent view among Baptists is that these offices are limited to men only, following the model of <a href="/wiki/Christ.html" title="Christ">Christ</a> and His <a href="/wiki/Twelve_Apostles.html" title="Twelve Apostles">apostles</a> and interpretations of 1 Timothy 2:12-14. However, the issue of women pastors and deacons has surfaced as controversy in some churches and denominations.</p>
<p>Another controversial issue is whether <a href="/wiki/Divorce.html" title="Divorce">divorced</a> individuals may serve as pastors and deacons. Of note was the controversy surrounding <a href="/wiki/Charles_Stanley_%28radio_evangelist%29.html" title="Charles Stanley (radio evangelist)">Charles Stanley</a>'s highly publicized divorce. One extreme view is that a divorced individual cannot serve under any circumstances. The other extreme is that divorced individuals can serve under all circumstances. There are also many views in between these two extremes with consideration for divorces which took place before conversion, and where the divorce resulted from the infidelity, abuse, or abandonment by the other spouse.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Pastor">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Pastor" id="Pastor"></a></p>
<h4>Pastor</h4>
<p>In the Baptist Church, the primary role of the pastor is to deliver the weekly sermon.</p>
<p>In smaller churches, the pastor will often visit homes and hospitals to call on ill members, as well as homes of prospective members (especially those who have not professed faith). The pastor will also perform weddings and funerals for members, and at business meetings serve as the moderator. The pastor may also be required to find outside work to supplement his income.</p>
<p>Larger churches will usually have one or more "associate" pastors, each with a specific area of responsibility, whereby the overall pastor is considered the "senior" pastor. Some examples are:</p>
<ul>
<li>music (the most common)</li>
<li>youth (in smaller churches, often combined with music)</li>
<li>children</li>
<li>administration (in the larger churches)</li>
</ul>
<p>or even</p>
<ul>
<li>evangelism</li>
<li>and a separate minister for the older children/college aged, whereby the children's minister is placed over the preschool and younger children</li>
</ul>
<p>In the majority of instances, the pastor will be married with children. Associate pastors may or may not be married, but if not married, they may find it difficult to be considered for a senior pastor position.</p>
<p>Some Baptists, especially <a href="/wiki/Reformed_Baptist.html" title="Reformed Baptist">Reformed Baptists</a>, believe in a plurality of elders. In that case usually only full-time paid elders will be called Pastor, while part-time volunteer pastors are more often called Elder, but these are regarded as the same office.</p>
<p>In the Jamaica Baptist Union, a Baptist minister is required to have at least a Bachelor's Degree in Theology or Divinity. He is then styled "The Reverend"</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Deacon">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Deacon" id="Deacon"></a></p>
<h4>Deacon</h4>
<p>The main role of the deacon is to assist the pastor with members' needs. Deacons also assist during communion. However, in many more modern Baptist churches, deacons have become administrators or governing body of the church. In many churches, the pastor takes on the role of spiritual leadership, while a deacon serves as moderator of board meetings. Deacons are usually chosen from members who have demonstrated exceptional Christian piety (see 1 Timothy 3:8-12), and serve without pay.</p>
<p>A common practice is for each family to be assigned a specific deacon, to be the primary point of contact whenever a need arises. Some larger mega churches which use cell groups have the cell group leaders serve the role of deacon.</p>

<h2>Justification by faith</h2>
<p>Justification by faith alone (<i><a href="/wiki/Sola_fide.html" title="Sola fide">sola fide</a></i>) states that it is by grace through faith alone that Christians receive salvation and not through any works of their own (see Ephesians 2:8). Baptists have a strong emphasis on the concept of <a href="/wiki/Salvation.html" title="Salvation">salvation</a>. Baptist theology teaches that the consequence of human sin is condemnation to eternal death in Hell. <a href="/wiki/Jesus.html" title="Jesus">Christ</a>'s death on the cross paid sin's penalty and his resurrection is evidence that eternal life is available to any who will have it. The only requirements being that each individual willfully repents of sin, accepts the substitutionary payment of his own sin by faith in Christ's death and declares that Jesus is Lord (see John 3:14-18 and Acts 10:34-43). Nevertheless, the Baptist view of <a href="/wiki/Soteriology.html" title="Soteriology">soteriology</a> runs the gamut from <a href="/wiki/Calvinism.html" title="Calvinism">Calvinism</a> to <a href="/wiki/Arminianism.html" title="Arminianism">Arminianism</a>.</p>

<p>They also believe in the divinity of Jesus and the Holy Spirit, which thus makes them believers in the Trinity: that is One God in Three Persons, Three persons in One God.

<h3>Comparisons with other denominations</h3>
<p>Baptists share certain emphasis with other groups such as <a href="/wiki/Evangelism.html" title="Evangelism">evangelism</a> and <a href="/wiki/Mission_%28Christian%29.html" title="Mission (Christian)">missions</a>. While the general flavor of any denomination changes from city to city, this aspect of Baptist churches is much more prominent than in most <a href="/wiki/Anglican.html" title="Anglican">Anglican</a>, <a href="/wiki/Methodist.html" title="Methodist">Methodist</a>, <a href="/wiki/Lutheran.html" title="Lutheran">Lutheran</a> and <a href="/wiki/Presbyterian.html" title="Presbyterian">Presbyterian</a> churches.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Pacifism.html" title="Pacifism">Pacifism</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Anabaptists.html" title="Anabaptists">Anabaptists</a> and the Quakers is not an ideal held by most Baptists. The <a href="/wiki/Baptist_Peace_Fellowship_of_North_America.html" title="Baptist Peace Fellowship of North America">Baptist Peace Fellowship of North America</a> was organized in <a href="/wiki/1984.html" title="1984">1984</a> to promote peace, justice, and non-violence, but it does not speak for all Baptists that accept the ideal of pacifism.</p>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australia</a>, the Baptist Union is very close to the <a href="/wiki/Restoration_Movement.html" title="Restoration Movement">Campbell-Stone</a> <a href="/wiki/Church_of_Christ.html" title="Church of Christ">Church of Christ</a>. The two groups share similar theology, even sharing a Bible college.</p>

<p>The focus of Baptist church services is the proclamation of the Word of God through the weekly sermon.</p>
<p>This can be seen in traditional Baptist church architecture. The <a href="/wiki/Pulpit.html" title="Pulpit">pulpit</a>, representative of the proclamation of the Word of God, is the largest piece of furniture and centered on the platform, while the communion table placed below it in a symbolically "subservient" position. This is in sharp contrast to <a href="/wiki/Roman_Catholic.html" title="Roman Catholic">Roman Catholic</a> layout which places the altar at the center of the platform, since the eucharistic sacrifice is the focus of the Mass, while the pulpit is off to one side.</p>
<p>Sermons often range in time from twenty to sixty minutes. They range in style from <a href="/wiki/Expository_preaching.html" title="Expository preaching">expository</a> sermons that focus on one biblical passage and interpret its meaning, to topical sermons which address an issue of concern and investigate several biblical passages related to that topic. Sermons often vary in solemnity.</p>
<p>The sermon is often surrounded by periods of musical worship lead by a song leader, choir, or band. Musical style varies between <a href="/wiki/Hymns.html" title="Hymns">hymns</a> and <a href="/wiki/Contemporary_Christian_music.html" title="Contemporary Christian music">contemporary Christian music</a> with many churches choosing a blend of the two. The choice in music style is often correlated to the predominant age of the members, with older congregations preferring traditional <a href="/wiki/Hymns.html" title="Hymns">hymns</a> played with piano and/or organ and featuring a choir. Younger congregations prefer contemporary music with modern instruments and no choir. In Jamaica, the use of Gospel Reggae is accepted because of the ethnicity of the music and "power it has to attract people." Larger churches may have a full orchestra along with the choir, and may also have multiple services each Sunday, each with a different worship style. Some fundamentalist Baptists will only sing hymns found in their hymnals written between the 1700s and the 1950s and generally oppose the use of drums and/or electric guitar in their services because they associate those instruments with <a href="/wiki/Rock_music.html" title="Rock music">rock music</a>.</p>
<p>Other common features in a Baptist church service include the collection of an offering, an altar call, a period of announcements, and Communion. Most Baptist congregations are small in number with membership under 200 people while other congregations are <a href="/wiki/Megachurch.html" title="Megachurch">megachurches</a> with membership in the tens of thousands.</p>

<h2>Origins</h2>
<p>There are several views about the origins of Baptists within the Baptist church.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Separatist">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Separatist" id="Separatist"></a></p>
<h3>Separatist</h3>
<p>This view suggests that Baptists were originally separatists in the <a href="/wiki/Puritan.html" title="Puritan">Puritan</a> reaction to perceived corruptions in the <a href="/wiki/Church_of_England.html" title="Church of England">Church of England</a> in the 1600s. In 1609, <a href="/wiki/John_Smyth_%281570-1612%29.html" title="John Smyth (1570-1612)">John Smyth</a> led a group of separatists to the Netherlands to start the <a href="/wiki/General_Baptist.html" title="General Baptist">General Baptist</a> church with an <a href="/wiki/Arminian.html" title="Arminian">Arminian</a> theology. In 1616, <a  class="new" title="Henry Jacob">Henry Jacob</a> led a group of Puritans in England with a <a href="/wiki/Calvinist.html" title="Calvinist">Calvinist</a> theology to form a congregational church that would eventually become the <a href="/wiki/Reformed_Baptist.html" title="Reformed Baptist">Particular Baptists</a> in 1638 under <a href="/wiki/John_Spilsbury_%28Baptist_minister%29.html" title="John Spilsbury (Baptist minister)">John Spilsbury</a>. Both groups had members who sailed to America as <a href="/wiki/Pilgrims.html" title="Pilgrims">pilgrims</a> to avoid religious persecution in England and Europe and who started Baptist churches in the early colonies. The Particular and General Baptists would disagree over Arminianism and Calvinism until the formation of the <a href="/wiki/Baptist_Union_of_Great_Britain.html" title="Baptist Union of Great Britain">Baptist Union of Great Britain</a> in the 1800s under <a href="/wiki/Andrew_Fuller.html" title="Andrew Fuller">Andrew Fuller</a> and <a href="/wiki/William_Carey.html" title="William Carey">William Carey</a> for the purpose of missions. American Baptists soon followed suit.</p>
<p>This is the most common view held by modern Baptists, which is found represented in the works of H. Leon McBeth and many others.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Landmarkist">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Landmarkist" id="Landmarkist"></a></p>
<h3>Landmarkist</h3>
<p><a href="/wiki/Landmark_Baptist_Church.html" title="Landmark Baptist Church">Landmarkism</a> is the belief that Baptist churches and traditions have preceded the Catholic Church and have been around since the time of <a href="/wiki/John_the_Baptist.html" title="John the Baptist">John the Baptist</a> and <a href="/wiki/Christ.html" title="Christ">Christ</a>. Proponents believe that Baptist traditions have been passed down through a succession of visible congregations of Christians that were Baptist in doctrine and practice, but not necessarily in name. This view is theologically based on <a  class="external text" title="http://php.ug.cs.usyd.edu.au/~jnot4610/bibref.php?book=%20Matthew&amp;verse=16:18&amp;src=31">Matthew 16:18</a> , "...and upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it." and a rejection of Catholicism as part of the historical origins of Baptists.</p>
<p>This lineage grants Baptist churches the status of being unstained and separate from what they see as the corruptions of <a href="/wiki/Catholicism.html" title="Catholicism">Catholicism</a> and other <a href="/wiki/Religious_denomination.html" title="Religious denomination">denominations</a>. It also allows for the view that Baptists predate the Catholic church and is therefore not part of the Reformation or the Protestant movement. <a href="/wiki/Alexander_Campbell_%28Restoration_movement%29.html" title="Alexander Campbell (Restoration movement)">Alexander Campbell</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Restoration_Movement.html" title="Restoration Movement">Restoration Movement</a> was a strong promoter of this idea.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/James_Milton_Carroll.html" title="James Milton Carroll">J. M. Carroll</a>'s <i><a  class="new" title="The Trail of Blood">The Trail of Blood</a></i>, written in <a href="/wiki/1931.html" title="1931">1931</a>, is commonly presented to defend this origin's view. Several groups considered to be part of this Baptist succession were groups persecuted by the Roman Catholic Church throughout history including <a href="/wiki/Montanists.html" title="Montanists">Montanists</a>, <a href="/wiki/Novatianists.html" title="Novatianists">Novatianists</a>, <a href="/wiki/Donatists.html" title="Donatists">Donatists</a>, <a href="/wiki/Paulicians.html" title="Paulicians">Paulicians</a>, <a href="/wiki/Albigensians.html" title="Albigensians">Albigensians</a>, <a href="/wiki/Catharists.html" title="Catharists">Catharists</a>, <a href="/wiki/Waldenses.html" title="Waldenses">Waldenses</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Anabaptists.html" title="Anabaptists">Anabaptists</a>. While some of these groups shared a few theological positions with current Baptists, many held positions that would now be considered heretical by current Baptists. It is also difficult to show historical connections between those groups which were often separated by large gaps in geography and time.</p>
<p>It is important to note that Landmarkism was the common view throughout the 1800s, yet has fallen into disfavor among most Baptist congregants. The works of <a href="/wiki/John_T._Christian.html" title="John T. Christian">John T. Christian</a> offer the best presentation of the Landmarkist message, while the works of <a  class="new" title="William Heth Whitsett">William Heth Whitsett</a> still stand as one of the best refutations of the position.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/American_Baptist_Association.html" title="American Baptist Association">American Baptist Association</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Baptist_Missionary_Association_of_America.html" title="Baptist Missionary Association of America">Baptist Missionary Association of America</a> originated from the debate over how much importance should be placed Landmark beliefs. Many of their churches still hold to the belief that, since the time of Christ, there has always been at least one church and usually several that have held true to the doctrines they believe the scriptures teach. While many of these churches believe a succession of belief exists, though it may not be documented anywhere except heaven, few, if any, of these churches hold to the extreme Landmarkist views that some held at the beginning of the twentieth century.</p>

<h3>Anabaptist</h3>
<p><a href="/wiki/Anabaptists.html" title="Anabaptists">Anabaptists</a> (<a href="/wiki/Mennonites.html" title="Mennonites">Mennonites</a>, <a href="/wiki/Amish.html" title="Amish">Amish</a>, <a href="/wiki/Hutterites.html" title="Hutterites">Hutterites</a>) were a group in the 1500s that rejected infant baptism and "rebaptized" members as adults. They share many teachings of the early Baptists, such as the <a href="/wiki/Believer%27s_baptism.html" title="Believer's baptism">believer's baptism</a> and <a href="/wiki/Religious_freedom.html" title="Religious freedom">religious freedom</a> and were probably influential in the development of many Baptist characteristics. While their names suggest some connection, some Anabaptists differed from the Baptists on many other issues such as <a href="/wiki/Pacifism.html" title="Pacifism">pacifism</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Communal.html" title="Communal">communal</a> sharing of material goods.</p>
<p>It is difficult to say how much influence the Anabaptists had on the actual formation of Baptist churches. One of the strongest relationships between the two groups happened when John Smyth's <a href="/wiki/General_Baptist.html" title="General Baptist">General Baptists</a> attempted but failed to merge with the Mennonites.</p>
<p>The works of <a href="/wiki/William_Roscoe_Estep.html" title="William Roscoe Estep">William Roscoe Estep</a> offer the best presentation of this viewpoint.</p>

<p><a name="The_name_.22Baptist.22" id="The_name_.22Baptist.22"></a></p>
<h2>The name "Baptist"</h2>
<p><b>Baptist</b> comes from the <a href="/wiki/Greek_language.html" title="Greek language">Greek</a> word βαπτιστής (<i>baptistés</i>, "baptist", used to describe John the Baptist), which is related to the verb βαπτίζω (<i>baptízo</i>, "to baptize, wash, dip, immerse"), and the <a href="/wiki/Latin.html" title="Latin">Latin</a> <i>baptista</i>, and is in direct connection to "the baptizer", John the Baptist.</p>
<p>As a <a href="/wiki/First_name.html" title="First name">first name</a> it is used in <a href="/wiki/Europe.html" title="Europe">Europe</a> from the twelfth century also as Baptiste, Jan-Baptiste, Jean-Baptiste, John-Baptist. In the Netherlands as of the seventeenth century, but mainly as of the eighteenth century as a combination like Jan Baptist or Johannes Baptist. As <a href="/wiki/Last_name.html" title="Last name">last name</a> it is used as of the thirteenth century. Also commonly used as Baptiste, Baptista, Batiste, Battiste, Battista.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Questions of labeling">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Questions_of_labeling" id="Questions_of_labeling"></a></p>
<h2>Questions of labeling</h2>
<p>Some Baptists object to the application of the labels <i><a href="/wiki/Protestant.html" title="Protestant">Protestant</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Religious_denomination.html" title="Religious denomination">denomination</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Evangelicalism.html" title="Evangelicalism">Evangelical</a></i> and even <i>Baptist</i> to themselves or their churches, while others accept those labels.</p>
<p>Some who reject the label <i>Baptist</i> prefer to be labeled as Christians who attend Baptist churches. Also, a recent trend (most common among megachurches and those embracing the "seeker movement") is to eliminate "Baptist" from the church name, as it is perceived to be a "barrier" to reaching persons who have negative views of Baptists, whether they be of a different church background or none. Conversely, others accept the label <i>Baptist</i> because they identify with the distinctives they consider to be uniquely Baptist, and believe those who are removing the name "Baptist" from their churches are "compromising with the world" in order to attract more members.</p>
<p>The label <i><a href="/wiki/Protestant.html" title="Protestant">Protestant</a></i> is rejected by some Baptists (primarily those in the Landmark movement) because in their view Baptists do not have a direct connection to <a href="/wiki/Martin_Luther.html" title="Martin Luther">Luther</a>, <a href="/wiki/John_Calvin.html" title="John Calvin">Calvin</a> or the <a href="/wiki/Roman_Catholic_Church.html" title="Roman Catholic Church">Roman Catholic Church</a> but have separately existed since the early church days (having never been a part of the Roman Catholic church, as such they are not "protesting" anything). Other Baptists accept the <i>Protestant</i> label as a demographic concept that describes churches who share similar theologies of <i><a href="/wiki/Sola_scriptura.html" title="Sola scriptura">sola scriptura</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Sola_fide.html" title="Sola fide">sola fide</a></i>, the priesthood of all believers and other positions that Luther, Calvin and traditional reformers held in contrast to the Roman Catholic Church in the 1500s.</p>
<p>The label <i><a href="/wiki/Religious_denomination.html" title="Religious denomination">denomination</a></i> is rejected by some because of the local autonomous governance system used by Baptist churches. Being a denomination is viewed as having a hierarchy that substitutes for the hierarchy of the Roman Catholic Church. Another reason for the rejection of the label is the influence of the <a href="/wiki/Restorationism.html" title="Restorationism">Restoration</a> period on Baptist churches, which emphasized a tearing down of denominational barriers. Other Baptists accept the label, feeling that it does not carry a negative connotation but rather is merely a synonym for a Christian or religious group with common beliefs, organized in a cooperative manner to spread its beliefs worldwide.</p>
<p>The label <i><a href="/wiki/Evangelicalism.html" title="Evangelicalism">Evangelical</a></i> is rejected by some fundamentalist Baptists who consider the term to describe a theological position that in their view is not fundamentalist enough, and conversely is also rejected by some liberal Baptists who consider the term to describe a theological position that in their view is too conservative. It is accepted by moderate Baptists who identify with the revival in the United States in the 1700s known as the <a href="/wiki/First_Great_Awakening.html" title="First Great Awakening">First Great Awakening</a>. Conversely, Evangelicals reject the label <a href="/wiki/Fundamentalist.html" title="Fundamentalist">fundamentalist</a>, believing it to describe a theological position that they consider too extreme and legalistic.</p>
