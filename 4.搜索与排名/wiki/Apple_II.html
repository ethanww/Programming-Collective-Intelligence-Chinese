The 1977 Apple II, complete with integrated keyboard, color graphics, sound, a plastic case, and eight expansion slots.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The <b>Apple II</b> (sometimes written as <b>Apple ][</b> or <b>Apple //</b>) was the first popular <a href="/wiki/Microcomputer.html" title="Microcomputer">microcomputer</a> manufactured by <a href="/wiki/Apple_Computer.html" title="Apple Computer">Apple Computer</a>. Its direct ancestor was the <a href="/wiki/Apple_I.html" title="Apple I">Apple I</a>, a limited production <a href="/wiki/Circuit_board.html" title="Circuit board">circuit board</a> computer for electronics hobbyists which pioneered many features that made the Apple II a commercial success. Introduced at the <a href="/wiki/West_Coast_Computer_Faire.html" title="West Coast Computer Faire">West Coast Computer Faire</a> in <a href="/wiki/1977.html" title="1977">1977</a>, the Apple II was one of the very first and most successful <a href="/wiki/Personal_computer.html" title="Personal computer">personal computers</a>. A number of different models were sold, and the most popular model was manufactured with relatively minor changes into the 1990s. By the end of its production in 1993, two million Apple II series computers had been produced.</p>
<p>Throughout the 1980s and much of the 1990s, the Apple II was the <i><a href="/wiki/De_facto.html" title="De facto">de facto</a></i> standard computer in <a href="/wiki/United_States.html" title="United States">American</a> education; some of them are still operational in classrooms today. The Apple II was popular with business users as well as with families and schools, particularly after the release of the first-ever computer <a href="/wiki/Spreadsheet.html" title="Spreadsheet">spreadsheet</a>, <a href="/wiki/VisiCalc.html" title="VisiCalc">VisiCalc</a>, which initially ran only on the Apple II.</p>
<p>Apple's <a href="/wiki/Apple_Macintosh.html" title="Apple Macintosh">Macintosh</a> product line finally eclipsed the Apple II series in the early 1990s. Even after the introduction of the Macintosh, the Apple II had remained Apple's primary source of revenue for years: the Apple II and its associated community of third-party developers and retailers was once a billion-dollar-a-year industry. The II<small>GS</small> model was sold through to the end of 1992. The IIe model was removed from the product line on <a href="/wiki/October_15.html" title="October 15">October 15</a>, <a href="/wiki/1993.html" title="1993">1993</a>, ending an era.</p>

<h2>Design</h2>
<p>Unlike any other microcomputer before it, the Apple II looked more like an <a href="/wiki/Appliance.html" title="Appliance">appliance</a> than a piece of electronic equipment. This was a computer that would not seem out of place in the home, on a manager's desk or in a classroom. The lid popped easily off the beige plastic case, allowing access to the entire internals of the computer, including the <a href="/wiki/Motherboard.html" title="Motherboard">motherboard</a> with eight <a href="/wiki/Expansion_slot.html" title="Expansion slot">expansion slots</a> and RAM sockets, which could hold up to 48&#160;<a href="/wiki/Kilobyte.html" title="Kilobyte">KB</a> of memory.</p>
<p>The Apple II had color and high-resolution graphics modes, sound capabilities and a built-in <a href="/wiki/BASIC.html" title="BASIC">BASIC</a> programming language. Compared with earlier microcomputers, these features were well-documented and easy to learn. The Apple II sparked the beginning of the <a href="/wiki/History_of_computing_hardware_%281960s-present%29.html" title="History of computing hardware (1960s-present)">personal computer revolution</a>, as it was targeted for the masses rather than just hobbyists and engineers; its introduction and subsequent popularity also greatly influenced most of the microcomputers that followed it.</p>

<h3>Apple II</h3>
<p>The first Apple II computers went on sale on <a href="/wiki/June_5.html" title="June 5">June 5</a>, <a href="/wiki/1977.html" title="1977">1977</a> with a <a href="/wiki/MOS_Technology.html" title="MOS Technology">MOS Technology</a> <a href="/wiki/MOS_Technology_6502.html" title="MOS Technology 6502">6502</a> microprocessor running at 1&#160;<a href="/wiki/Megahertz.html" title="Megahertz">MHz</a>, 4&#160;KB of <a href="/wiki/Random_Access_Memory.html" title="Random Access Memory">RAM</a>, an <a href="/wiki/Compact_audio_cassette.html" title="Compact audio cassette">audio cassette</a> interface for loading programs and storing data, and the <a href="/wiki/Integer_BASIC.html" title="Integer BASIC">Integer BASIC</a> programming language built into the <a href="/wiki/Read-only_memory.html" title="Read-only memory">ROMs</a>. The video controller displayed 24 lines by 40 columns of upper-case-only text on the screen, with <a href="/wiki/NTSC.html" title="NTSC">NTSC</a> <a href="/wiki/Composite_video.html" title="Composite video">composite video</a> output suitable for display on a monitor, or on a TV set by way of an <a href="/wiki/RF_modulator.html" title="RF modulator">RF modulator</a>. The original retail price of the computer was <a href="/wiki/United_States_dollar.html" title="United States dollar">US$</a>1298 (with 4&#160;KB of RAM) and US$2638 (with the maximum 48&#160;KB of RAM). To reflect the computer's color graphics capability, the Apple logo on the casing was represented using rainbow stripes,<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a  title="">[1]</a></sup> which remained a part of Apple's corporate logo until early 1998. The earliest Apple IIs were assembled in <a href="/wiki/Silicon_Valley.html" title="Silicon Valley">Silicon Valley</a>, and later in <a href="/wiki/Texas.html" title="Texas">Texas</a>; <a href="/wiki/Printed_circuit_board.html" title="Printed circuit board">printed circuit boards</a> were manufactured in <a href="/wiki/Ireland.html" title="Ireland">Ireland</a> and <a href="/wiki/Singapore.html" title="Singapore">Singapore</a>.</p>
<p>In 1978, an external 5¼-inch <a href="/wiki/Floppy_disk.html" title="Floppy disk">floppy disk</a> drive, the <a href="/wiki/Disk_II.html" title="Disk II">Disk II</a>, attached via a controller card that plugged into one of the computer's expansion slots (usually slot 6), was used for data storage and retrieval to replace cassettes. The Disk II interface, created by <a href="/wiki/Steve_Wozniak.html" title="Steve Wozniak">Steve Wozniak</a>, was regarded as an engineering masterpiece at the time.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a  title="">[2]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a  title="">[3]</a></sup> While other controllers had dozens of chips for synchronizing data I/O with disk rotation, seeking the head to the appropriate track, and encoding the data into magnetic pulses, Wozniak's controller card had few chips; instead, the <a href="/wiki/Apple_DOS.html" title="Apple DOS">Apple DOS</a> used software to perform these functions. The <a href="/wiki/Group_Code_Recording.html" title="Group Code Recording">Group Code Recording</a> used by the controller was simpler and easier to implement in software than the more common <a href="/wiki/Modified_Frequency_Modulation.html" title="Modified Frequency Modulation">MFM</a>. In the end, the low chip count of the controller contributed to making Apple's Disk II the first affordable floppy drive system for personal computers. As a side effect, Woz's scheme made it easy for <a href="/wiki/Proprietary_software.html" title="Proprietary software">proprietary software</a> developers to <a href="/wiki/Copy_protection.html" title="Copy protection">copy-protect</a> the media on which their software shipped by changing the low-level sector format or stepping the drive's head between the tracks; inevitably, other companies eventually sold software to foil this protection.</p>
<p>The approach taken in the Disk II controller was typical of Wozniak's design sensibility. The Apple II was full of clever engineering tricks to save hardware and reduce costs. For example, by interleaving the video generation circuitry's memory access with that of the CPU—a feature unique to the 6502—Wozniak eliminated the need for a separate refresh circuit for the DRAM chips. Rather than using a complex analog-to-digital circuit to read the outputs of the game controller, Wozniak used a simple timer circuit whose period was proportional to the resistance of the game controller, and used a software loop to measure the timer. The text and graphics screens had a somewhat outdated arrangement (the scanlines were not stored in sequential areas of memory) which was reputedly due to Woz's realization that doing it that way would save a chip; it was less expensive to have software calculate or look up the address of the required scanline than to include the extra hardware. Similarly, in the high-resolution graphics mode, color was determined by pixel position and could thus be implemented in software, saving Woz the chips needed to convert <a href="/wiki/Bitplane.html" title="Bitplane">bitplanes</a> to colors.</p>
<p>The epitome of the Apple II design philosophy was the Apple II sound circuitry. Rather than having a dedicated sound-synthesis chip, the Apple II had a toggle circuit that could only emit a click through a built-in speaker; all other sounds (including two, three and, eventually, four-voice music and playback of audio samples and speech synthesis) were generated entirely by clever software that clicked the speaker at just the right times. Not for nearly a decade would an Apple II be released with a dedicated sound chip. Similar techniques were used for cassette storage: the cassette output worked the same as the speaker, and the input was a simple zero-crossing detector that served as a relatively crude (1-bit) audio digitizer. Routines in the ROM were used to encode and decode data in <a href="/wiki/Frequency_shift_keying.html" title="Frequency shift keying">frequency shift keying</a> for the cassette.</p>
<p>Wozniak's open design and the Apple II's multiple expansion slots permitted a wide variety of third-party devices to expand the capabilities of the machine. <a href="/wiki/Apple_II_peripheral_cards.html" title="Apple II peripheral cards">Apple II peripheral cards</a> such as <a href="/wiki/Apple_II_serial_cards.html" title="Apple II serial cards">Serial controllers</a>, improved display controllers, memory boards, hard disks, and networking components were available for this system in its day. There were emulator cards, such as the Z80 card that permitted the Apple to switch to the <a href="/wiki/Zilog_Z80.html" title="Zilog Z80">Z80</a> processor and run a multitude of programs developed under the <a href="/wiki/CPM_operating_system.html" title="CPM operating system">CP/M operating system</a>, including the <a href="/wiki/DBASE.html" title="DBASE">dBase II</a> database and the <a href="/wiki/WordStar.html" title="WordStar">WordStar</a> word processor. There was also a third-party <a href="/wiki/Motorola_6809.html" title="Motorola 6809">6809</a> card that would allow <a href="/wiki/OS-9.html" title="OS-9">OS-9</a> Level One to be run. The <a href="/wiki/Mockingboard.html" title="Mockingboard">Mockingboard</a> sound card greatly improved the audio capabilities of the Apple, with simple music synthesis and text-to-speech functions. Eventually, <a href="/wiki/Apple_II_accelerators.html" title="Apple II accelerators">Apple II accelerator cards</a> were created to double or quadruple the computer's speed.</p>

<p>The Apple II was eventually superseded by the <b>Apple II Plus</b>, which included the <a href="/wiki/Applesoft_BASIC.html" title="Applesoft BASIC">Applesoft BASIC</a> programming language in <a href="/wiki/ROM.html" title="ROM">ROM</a>. This <a href="/wiki/Microsoft.html" title="Microsoft">Microsoft</a>-authored dialect of BASIC, which was previously available as an upgrade, supported floating-point arithmetic (though it ran at a noticeably slower speed than Steve Wozniak's Integer BASIC) and became the standard BASIC dialect on the Apple II series.</p>
<p>The Apple II Plus had a total of 48&#160;KB of RAM, expandable to 64&#160;KB by means of the <i>language card,</i> an expansion card that could be installed in the computer's slot 0. The Apple's 6502 microprocessor could support a maximum of 64&#160;KB of memory, and a machine with 48&#160;KB RAM reached this limit because of the additional 16&#160;KB of read-only memory and I/O addresses. For this reason, the extra RAM in the language card was bank-switched over the machine's built-in ROM, allowing code loaded into the additional memory to be used as if it actually were ROM. Users could thus load Integer BASIC into the language card from disk and switch between the Integer and Applesoft dialects of BASIC with DOS 3.3's INT and FP commands just as if they had the BASIC ROM expansion card. The language card was also required to use the <a href="/wiki/UCSD_Pascal.html" title="UCSD Pascal">UCSD Pascal</a> and <a href="/wiki/FORTRAN.html" title="FORTRAN">FORTRAN 77</a> compilers, which were released by Apple at about the same time. These ran under a non-DOS operating system called the UCSD P-System, which had its own disk format and included a "virtual machine" that allowed it to run on many different types of hardware.</p>

The <a href="/wiki/Power_supply.html" title="Power supply">power supply</a> was modified to handle 240 <a href="/wiki/Volt.html" title="Volt">volts</a>, the video output signal was changed from <a href="/wiki/NTSC.html" title="NTSC">NTSC</a> to <a href="/wiki/PAL.html" title="PAL">PAL</a>, and the keyboard layout was changed to allow for various <a href="/wiki/Language.html" title="Language">language</a> differences. Keyboard modifications were easiest in Europe where, for the most part, the standard <a href="/wiki/Roman_alphabet.html" title="Roman alphabet">Roman alphabet</a> was used. One alteration necessary in that part of the world was the inclusion of diacritical marks or accents on letters. For example, the II Europlus had a modified <a href="/wiki/ROM.html" title="ROM">ROM</a>, and certain <a href="/wiki/ESC.html" title="ESC">ESC</a> key sequences could generate the <a href="/wiki/German_language.html" title="German language">German</a> umlaut symbol ("¨") to go with certain <a href="/wiki/Vowels.html" title="Vowels">vowels</a> (such as ä or ü).

<p>The Apple II Plus was followed in 1983 by the <b><a href="/wiki/Apple_IIe.html" title="Apple IIe">Apple IIe</a></b>, a cost-reduced yet more powerful machine that used newer chips to reduce the component count and add new features, such as the display of upper and lowercase letters and a standard 64&#160;KB of RAM. The IIe RAM was configured as if it were a 48&#160;KB Apple II Plus with a language card; the machine had no slot 0, but instead had an auxiliary slot that for all practical purposes took the place of slot 3, the most commonly used slot for 80 column cards in the II Plus. The auxiliary slot could accept a 1&#160;KB memory card to enable the 80-column display. This card contained only RAM; the hardware and firmware for the 80-column display was built into the Apple IIe, remaining fairly compatible with the older Videx-style cards, even though the low-level details were very different. An "extended 80-column card" with more memory expanded the machine's RAM to 128&#160;KB. As with the language card, the memory in the 80-column card was bank-switched over the machine's main RAM; this made the memory better suited to data storage than to running software, and in fact the <a href="/wiki/ProDOS.html" title="ProDOS">ProDOS</a> operating system, which was introduced with the Apple IIe, would automatically configure this memory as a <a href="/wiki/RAM_disk.html" title="RAM disk">RAM disk</a> upon booting. Third-party aux-slot memory cards later allowed expansion up to 1&#160;<a href="/wiki/Megabyte.html" title="Megabyte">MB</a>. The 1K 80-column card also enabled one new graphics mode, Double Lo-Res (80×48 pixels); the extended 80-column card enabled two, Double Lo-Res and Double Hi-Res (560×192 pixels). Both modes doubled the horizontal resolution in comparison to the standard Lo-Res (40×48) and Hi-Res (280×192) Modes; in the case of Double Hi-Res, the number of available colors was increased as well, from 6 to 15. Apple IIe's from the very first production run cannot use Double Hi-Res. Neither of these modes was directly supported by the built-in BASIC, however, so the user had to resort to the use of lots of POKE and CALL commands, or assembly language programming, or one of a number of software Toolkits to exploit these modes.</p>
<p>Introduced with the IIe was the DuoDisk, essentially two Disk II 5¼" drives in a single enclosure designed to stack between the computer and the monitor, and a new controller card to run it. This controller was (by design) functionally identical to the original Disk II controller but used a different connector, allowing a single cable to control both drives in the DuoDisk. The DuoDisk was plagued by reliability problems, however, and did not catch on as well as the IIe itself.</p>
<p>The IIe was the most popular Apple II ever built and was widely considered the "workhorse" of the line. It also has the distinction of being the longest-lived Apple computer of all time -- it was manufactured and sold with only minor changes for nearly eleven years. In that time, following the original, two important variations came to pass known as the <a href="/wiki/Apple_IIe#The_Enhanced_IIe.html" title="Apple IIe">Enhanced IIe</a> (four new replacement chips to give it the same features as the later model <a href="/wiki/Apple_IIc.html" title="Apple IIc">Apple IIc</a>, including an upgraded processor called the 65C02) and <a href="/wiki/Apple_IIe#The_Platinum_IIe.html" title="Apple IIe">Platinum IIe</a> (a modernized new look for the case color to match other Apple products of the era, along with the addition of a built-in numeric keypad). An Enhanced IIe with 128&#160;KB of RAM can be considered the minimum requirement for running most Apple II software released after about 1988.</p>
<p>Two and a half years before the Apple IIe, Apple had produced and marketed a computer called the <i><a href="/wiki/Apple_III.html" title="Apple III">Apple III</a></i> for business users. This product was not a success, and Steve Wozniak has been quoted as saying that the Apple III had a 100% failure rate -- every single machine manufactured had some kind of fault. Many of its features were carried over in the design of the Apple IIe, though, including the ProDOS operating system, which was based on Apple III SOS.</p>

The Apple IIc was Apple's first compact and portable computer.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Apple released the <b><a href="/wiki/Apple_IIc.html" title="Apple IIc">Apple IIc</a></b> in April 1984, billing it as a portable Apple II, because it could be easily carried; however it lacked battery power and a built-in display. The IIc even sported a carrying handle that folded down to prop the machine up into a typing position. It was the first of three Apple II models to be made in the <a href="/wiki/Snow_White_design_language.html" title="Snow White design language">Snow White design language</a>, and the only one that was actually white. The other computers from the Apple II series, the II<small>GS</small> and the IIc Plus, were actually light gray, sometimes called "platinum" by Apple.</p>
<p>The Apple IIc was the first Apple II to use the updated <a href="/wiki/65C02_Microprocessor.html" title="65C02 Microprocessor">65C02</a> processor, and featured a built-in floppy drive and 128&#160;KB RAM, with a built-in disk controller that could control external drives, composite video (NTSC or PAL), serial interfaces for modem and printer, and a joystick/mouse port. Unlike previous Apple II models, the IIc had no internal expansion slots at all, this being the means by which its compact size was attained. Third parties did eventually figure out how to wedge up to 1&#160;MB of additional memory and a real-time clock into the machine, and a later revision of the motherboard provided an expansion slot that could accept an Apple memory card bearing up to 1&#160;MB of RAM. The disk port, originally intended for a second 5¼" floppy drive, eventually was able to interface to 3½" disk drives and (via third parties) even hard disks.</p>
<p>To play up the portability, two different monochrome <a href="/wiki/LCD.html" title="LCD">LCD</a> displays were sold for use with the IIc's video expansion port, although both were short-lived due to high cost and poor legibility. (A IIc with the smaller of these displays appeared briefly in the film <a  title="2010: The Year We Make Contact">2010</a>.) The IIc had an external power supply that converted AC power to 12V DC, allowing third parties to offer battery packs and automobile power adapters that connected in place of the supplied AC adapter.</p>
<p>The Apple IIc (in its American version) was the first microcomputer to include support for the <a href="/wiki/Dvorak_Simplified_Keyboard.html" title="Dvorak Simplified Keyboard">Dvorak Simplified Keyboard</a>, which was activated using a switch above the keyboard. This feature was also later found in late-model American Apple IIe computers (though the switch was inside the computer) and in the Apple II<small>GS</small> (accessible via the built-in control panel).</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>The next member of the line was the <b><a href="/wiki/Apple_IIgs.html" title="Apple IIgs">Apple II<small>GS</small></a></b> computer, released in 1986. A radical departure from the existing Apple II line, the II<small>GS</small> featured a true <a href="/wiki/16-bit.html" title="16-bit">16-bit</a> microprocessor, the <a href="/wiki/65816_Microprocessor.html" title="65816 Microprocessor">65C816</a>, operating at 2.8&#160;MHz with 24-bit addressing, allowing expansion up to 8&#160;MB of RAM without the bank-switching hassles of the earlier machines. It introduced two completely new graphic modes sporting higher resolutions and a palette of 4,096 colors; however, only 4 (at 640×200 resolution) or 16 (at 320×200 resolution) colors could be used on a single line at a time, although a technique known as <i><a href="/wiki/Dithering.html" title="Dithering">dithering</a></i> was often employed in software to increase the number of perceived colors.</p>
<p>In a welcome departure from earlier Apple II graphics modes, the new modes laid out the scanlines sequentially in memory. However, programmers in search of a graphics challenge could always turn to 3200-color mode, which involved precisely swapping in a different 16-color palette for each of the screen's 200 scanlines as the monitor's electron beam traced the screen line by line. This exotic technique did not leave many CPU cycles available for other processing, so this "mode" was best suited to displaying static images.</p>
<p>The Apple II<small>GS</small> stood out from any previous (or future) Apple II models, evolving and advancing the platform into the next generation of computing while still maintaining near-complete backward compatibility. The secret of the Apple II<small>GS</small>'s compatibility was a single chip called the <a href="/wiki/Mega_II.html" title="Mega II">Mega II</a>, which contained the functional equivalent of an entire Apple IIe computer (sans processor), which, combined with the flawless 65C02 emulation mode of the 65C816 processor, provided full support for legacy software.</p>
<p>The computer also included a 32-voice <a href="/wiki/Ensoniq.html" title="Ensoniq">Ensoniq</a> <a href="/wiki/Wavetable.html" title="Wavetable">wavetable</a> music synthesizer with 64&#160;KB dedicated RAM, 256&#160;KB of standard RAM, built-in peripheral ports (switchable between IIe-style card slots and IIc-style onboard controllers for disk drives, mouse, RGB video, and serial devices), built-in <a href="/wiki/AppleTalk.html" title="AppleTalk">AppleTalk</a> networking, and a ROM toolbox that supported a graphical user interface derived from the Macintosh toolbox. The computer could run existing 8-bit Apple II software (including software written for the very first Apple II in Integer BASIC), but also supported 16-bit software running under a new OS first called ProDOS 16 and later called GS/OS. The new OS eventually included a Finder that could be used for managing disks and files and opening documents and applications, along with desk accessories -- just like the Macintosh. The 16-bit operating system would automatically switch to the text display and downshift to 8-bit mode to run legacy software, while offering a consistent, Macintosh-like graphical interface for native 16-bit applications. Eventually the II<small>GS</small> gained the ability to read and write Macintosh disks and, through third-party software, even multitasking (both cooperative and preemptive, the latter in the form of a Unix-type shell), outline TrueType font support, and in one case, even real-time 3D gaming using texture mapping.</p>
<p>The first 50,000 Apple II<small>GS</small> computers came with Steve Wozniak's "Woz" signature silkscreened on the front and were referred to as the "Woz Limited Edition." These machines are not functionally different from machines from the same time period without the signature.</p>
<p>The Apple II<small>GS</small> with 1&#160;MB of built-in RAM (better known as the "ROM 3"), was introduced in late 1989. Along with the additional built-in memory, the ROM 3 contained improvements to the firmware and cleaner sound output. Connector locations that had enabled the previous II<small>GS</small> motherboard to be installed in an Apple IIe case were eliminated to save costs. Most users considered the ROM 3 a minor maintenance update rather than a new model.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>The final Apple II model was the <b><a href="/wiki/Apple_IIc_Plus.html" title="Apple IIc Plus">Apple IIc Plus</a></b> introduced in 1988. It was the same size and shape as the IIc that came before it, but the 5¼" floppy drive had been replaced with a 3½" drive, the power supply was moved inside (gone was the IIc's "brick on a leash" power supply), and the processor was a fast 4&#160;MHz 65C02 processor that actually ran 8-bit Apple II software faster than the II<small>GS</small>. (Third-party accelerators for other models could, however, go as fast as 10&#160;MHz, and II<small>GS</small> accelerators would eventually reach 16&#160;MHz.) The IIc Plus's accelerator was derived from a design licensed from Zip Technologies, a third-party maker of accelerators for the Apple II, though Apple used separate chips instead of combining the processor, cache, and supporting logic on a multi-chip module as did Zip. Like later models of the original Apple IIc, the IIc Plus included a memory expansion slot that would accept a daughter-card carrying up to a megabyte of RAM. The IIc Plus also featured a new keyboard layout that matched the Platinum IIe and II<small>GS</small>. Unlike the IIe, IIc and II<small>GS</small>, the IIc Plus came only in one, American, version, and was not officially sold anywhere outside the USA.</p>
<p>Many perceived the IIc Plus as Apple's attempt to compete with the Laser 128EX/2, a popular third party Apple-compatible machine that also had an accelerated processor and a built-in 3½" drive. There were few other rational explanations for Apple expending resources on the continued development of a new 8-bit Apple II model rather than furthering the 16-bit Apple II<small>GS</small>. However, with its 3½" drive and speedy processor, it was an excellent, compact machine for running the <a href="/wiki/AppleWorks.html" title="AppleWorks">AppleWorks</a> integrated productivity package, especially with the 1&#160;MB memory upgrade.</p>

<p>Although not an extension of the Apple II line, in 1990 the <b><a href="/wiki/Apple_IIe_Card.html" title="Apple IIe Card">Apple IIe Card</a></b>, an expansion card for the <a href="/wiki/Macintosh_LC.html" title="Macintosh LC">LC</a> line of <a href="/wiki/Apple_Macintosh.html" title="Apple Macintosh">Macintosh</a> computers, was released. Essentially a miniaturized Apple IIe computer on a card (using the Mega II chip from the Apple II<small>GS</small>), it allowed the Macintosh to run 8-bit Apple IIe software through hardware emulation (although video was emulated in software and was slower at times than a IIe). Many of the LC's built-in Macintosh peripherals could be "borrowed" by the card when in Apple II mode (i.e. extra RAM, 3½" floppy, AppleTalk networking, hard disk). The IIe card could not, however, run software intended for the 16-bit Apple II<small>GS</small>. The Macintosh LC with IIe Card was intended to replace the Apple II<small>GS</small> in schools and homes and was presumably the reason a new model Apple II<small>GS</small> that was confirmed by insiders to be in development at one point was cancelled and never released.</p>

<p><a name="Other_peripheral_cards" id="Other_peripheral_cards"></a></p>
<h3>Other peripheral cards</h3>
<p>There were many companies during the 80s that provided the Apple II line of computers peripheral cards that added functionality thanks to <a href="/wiki/Steve_Wozniak.html" title="Steve Wozniak">Steve Wozniak's</a> slot design. One such company was <a href="/wiki/Applied_Engineering.html" title="Applied Engineering">Applied Engineering</a>. Two of the most popular and successful cards were the RamWorks (and its successors, the RamWorks II and RamWorks III) and the TransWarp cards. The RamWorks III card replaced the Apple IIe's auxiliary-slot memory card and with the appropriate daughter board could hold a whopping 3&#160;MB of RAM. The TransWarp card was an <a href="/wiki/Apple_II_accelerators.html" title="Apple II accelerators">Accelerator Card</a> that could speed up the Apple II from its native 1&#160;MHz processor to 3.6&#160;MHz for the TransWarp and 8&#160;MHz for the TransWarp II. Applied Engineering also developed and sold a 1.44&#160;MB 3½" disk drive, an improvement over Apple's own 800&#160;KB UniDisk 3½ (for the Apple IIe and IIc) and Apple 3½ Drive (for the Apple II<small>GS</small>), though Apple did eventually release its own 1.44&#160;MB drive (dubbed the SuperDrive) on the Apple IIe and II<small>GS</small>. The SuperDrive was one of the last Apple II products released by Apple, and was canceled after a short time, together with the whole Apple II line. The Applied Engineering or AE drive came with its own controller card.</p>
<p>Another card available from <a href="/wiki/Apple_Computer.html" title="Apple Computer">Apple Computer</a> was the Apple II ProFile card. This card attached to the <a href="/wiki/Apple_ProFile.html" title="Apple ProFile">Apple ProFile</a> Hard Disk that was initially designed for the <a href="/wiki/Apple_III.html" title="Apple III">Apple III</a> computer. The ProFile was available first in a 5&#160;MB configuration and later in a 10&#160;MB one.</p>

<h3>Final years</h3>
<p>Apple's Macintosh product line finally eclipsed the Apple II in the early 1990s. Even after the Macintosh's introduction, the Apple II had remained the company's primary revenue source for years: the Apple II and its associated community of third-party developers and retailers was once a billion-dollar-a-year industry. The computer was the first to attract a loyal user community and many outspoken Apple II fans were bitter that the company had invested its Apple II profits into the Macintosh rather than using them to further the Apple II series.</p>
<p>Despite withholding advertising and little corporate support, Apple continued to sell the II<small>GS</small> throughout 1992. Apple brought an era to a close when the IIe was removed from the product line on <a href="/wiki/October_15.html" title="October 15">October 15</a>, <a href="/wiki/1993.html" title="1993">1993</a>.</p>

<h2>Marketing, advertising, and packaging</h2>
<p><a href="/wiki/Mike_Markkula.html" title="Mike Markkula">Mike Markkula</a>, a venture capitalist who provided early critical funding for Apple Computer, was keen on marketing. From 1977 until 1981 Apple used the <a href="/wiki/Regis_McKenna.html" title="Regis McKenna">Regis McKenna</a> agency for its advertisements and marketing. In 1981, Chiat-Day acquired Regis McKenna's advertising operations and Apple used <a href="/wiki/Chiat/Day.html" title="Chiat/Day">Chiat/Day</a>. Ever since the original Apple II in 1977, Apple has paid high attention to its quality of packaging, partly because of <a href="/wiki/Steve_Jobs.html" title="Steve Jobs">Steve Jobs</a>' personal preferences and opinions on packaging and presentation. All of Apple's packaging for the Apple II series looked similar, featuring lots of clean white space and showing the Apple rainbow logo prominently.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a  title="">[4]</a></sup> For several years up until the 1980s, Apple used the <a href="/wiki/Apple_typography#Motter_Tektura.html" title="Apple typography">Motter Tekkura</a> font for packaging, until changing to the <a href="/wiki/Typography_and_logography_of_Apple_Computer#Apple_Garamond.html" title="Typography and logography of Apple Computer">Apple Garamond</a> font.</p>
<p>Apple ran the first advertisements for the Apple II in 1977, including a brochure called "Simplicity", the "A is for Apple" print ad and a two page spread magazine ad called "Introducing the Apple II" which was featured in <i><a href="/wiki/Scientific_American.html" title="Scientific American">Scientific American</a></i>.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a  title="">[5]</a></sup> All of the advertisements were targeted at home users, emphasizing the ease of use and capabilities of an Apple II.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a  title="">[6]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a  title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>Apple later aired eight television commercials for the Apple IIGS, emphasizing on its benefits to education and students, along with some print ads.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a  title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>Towards the end of 1982, art director Brent Thomas and Steve Hayden came up with the idea of doing an <a href="/wiki/Ad_campaign.html" title="Ad campaign">ad campaign</a> based on the timely tagline "Why 1984 won't be like 1984". Chiat-Day shopped it around to a number of clients, including Apple, where it was proposed to be used for a print ad in the <a href="/wiki/Wall_Street_Journal.html" title="Wall Street Journal">Wall Street Journal</a> promoting the Apple II. However, Apple didn't go for it, and the idea was filed away until the spring of 1983, when they met with the Macintosh marketing team to start working on the launch, which was scheduled for January 1984. The idea eventually became the famous <i><a href="/wiki/1984_%28television_commercial%29.html" title="1984 (television commercial)">1984</a></i> commercial which aired during the Third Quarter at <a href="/wiki/Super_Bowl_XVIII.html" title="Super Bowl XVIII">Super Bowl XVIII</a>.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a  title="">[9]</a></sup></p>

The Medfly computer featured a faster processor, more memory, detached keyboard, lower and upper case characters and a built-in disk controller.</p>
<p><a  class="new" title="Unitron">Unitron</a>, a Brazilian company, produced another clone, named ApII. Unitron used a copy of the Apple's ROM translated to Portuguese. The operating system was Apple's DOS 3.3 translated to Portuguese. During this period, it was illegal to import microcomputers in Brazil, and buying those (illegal) clones was the only way to have a microcomputer. Unitron stopped manufacturing the ApII a few years after the introduction of IBM PC clones in Brazil.</p>
<p>The Ace clones from <a href="/wiki/Franklin_Computer_Corporation.html" title="Franklin Computer Corporation">Franklin Computer Corporation</a> are the best known and had the most lasting impact, as Franklin copied Apple's ROMs and software and freely admitted to doing so. Franklin's argument: a computer's ROM was simply a pattern of switches locked into a fixed position, and one cannot copyright a pattern of switches. Apple fought Franklin in court for about five years to get its clones off the market, and was ultimately successful when a court ruled that software stored in ROM was in fact copyrightable. (See <a href="/wiki/Apple_Computer%2C_Inc._v._Franklin_Computer_Corp..html" title="Apple Computer, Inc. v. Franklin Computer Corp.">Apple Computer, Inc. v. Franklin Computer Corp.</a>) Franklin later released non-infringing but less-compatible clones; these could run ProDOS and AppleWorks and had an Applesoft-like BASIC, but compatibility with other software was hit-or-miss.</p>
<p>Apple also challenged <a href="/wiki/VTech.html" title="VTech">VTech</a>'s <a href="/wiki/Laser_128.html" title="Laser 128">Laser 128</a>, an enhanced clone of the Apple IIc first released in 1984, in court. This suit proved less fruitful for Apple, because VTech had <a href="/wiki/Reverse_engineering.html" title="Reverse engineering">reverse-engineered</a> the Monitor ROM rather than copying it and had licensed Applesoft BASIC from its creator, <a href="/wiki/Microsoft.html" title="Microsoft">Microsoft</a>. Incredibly, Apple had neglected to obtain exclusive rights to the Applesoft dialect of BASIC from Microsoft; just as incredibly, VTech was the first cloner to bother licensing it. The Laser 128 proved popular and remained on the market for many years, both in its original form and in accelerated versions that ran faster than 1&#160;MHz. Although it wasn't 100% compatible with the Apple II, it was close, and its popularity ensured that most major developers tested their software on a Laser as well on as genuine Apple machines. Because it was frequently sold via mail order and mass-market retailers such as <a href="/wiki/Sears.html" title="Sears">Sears</a>, the Laser 128 may have cut into the sales of low-cost competitors such as <a href="/wiki/Commodore_Business_Machines.html" title="Commodore Business Machines">Commodore Business Machines</a> as much as it did Apple's.</p>
<p>While the first Apple II clones were generally exact copies of their Apple counterparts that competed mainly on price, many clones had extra capabilities too. A Franklin model, the Ace 1000, sported a numeric keypad and lower-case long before these features were added to the Apple II line. The Laser 128 series is sometimes credited with spurring Apple to release the Apple IIc Plus; the built-in 3½" drive and accelerated processor were features Laser had pioneered. The Laser 128 also had a IIe-style expansion slot on the side that could be used to add peripheral cards.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/B%C3%B6we_Bell_%26_Howell.html" title="Böwe Bell &amp; Howell">Bell &amp; Howell</a>, an audiovisual equipment manufacturer whose products (particularly film projectors) were ubiquitous in American schools, offered what appeared at first glance to be an Apple II Plus clone in a distinctive black plastic case. However, these were in fact real Apple II Pluses manufactured by Apple for B&amp;H for a brief period of time. Many schools had a few of these "black Apples" in their labs.</p>

Apple II floppy diskette with <a href="/wiki/Disk_II.html" title="Disk II">Disk II</a> cover.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Originally the Apple II used audio cassette tapes for program and data storage. A dedicated tape recorder along the lines of the Commodore <a href="/wiki/Datasette.html" title="Datasette">Datasette</a> was never produced; Apple recommended using the <a href="/wiki/Panasonic.html" title="Panasonic">Panasonic</a> RQ309 in some of its early printed documentation. Apple and many third-party developers made software available on tape at first, but after the Disk II became available, tape-based Apple II software essentially disappeared from the market.</p>
<p>The Disk II floppy drive used 5¼-inch <a href="/wiki/Floppy_disk.html" title="Floppy disk">floppy disks</a>. The first <a href="/wiki/Disk_operating_system.html" title="Disk operating system">disk operating systems</a> for the Apple II were <a href="/wiki/Apple_DOS.html" title="Apple DOS">DOS 3.1</a> and DOS 3.2, which stored 113.75&#160;KB on each disk, organized into thirty-five tracks of thirteen 256-byte sectors each. After about two years, DOS 3.3 was introduced, storing 140&#160;KB thanks to a minor hardware change on the disk controller that allowed it to store 16 sectors per track. (This upgrade was user-installable on older controllers.) After the release of DOS 3.3, the user community discontinued use of DOS 3.2 except for running legacy software. Programs that required DOS 3.2 were fairly rare, however, as DOS 3.3 was not a major architectural change aside from the number of sectors per track. A program called MUFFIN was provided with DOS 3.3 to allow users to copy files from DOS 3.2 disks to DOS 3.3 disks.</p>
<p>On a DOS 3.x disk, tracks 0, 1, and most of track 2 were reserved to store the operating system. A short ROM program on the disk controller had the ability to seek to track zero -- which it did without regard for the read/write head's current position, resulting in the characteristic "chattering" sound of a Disk II boot, which was the read/write head hitting the rubber stop block at the end of the rail -- and read and execute code from sector 0. The disk's directory was stored on track 17, smack in the middle of the 35-track disks, in order to reduce the average <a href="/wiki/Seek_time.html" title="Seek time">seek time</a> to the frequently-used directory track. The directory was fixed in size and could hold a maximum of 105 files. Subdirectories were not supported.</p>
<p>Most game publishers did not include DOS on their floppy disks, since they needed the memory it occupied more than its capabilities; instead, they often wrote their own boot loaders and read-only file systems. This also served to discourage "crackers" from snooping around in the game's copy-protection code, since the data on the disk wasn't in files that could be accessed easily.</p>
<p>Some third-party manufacturers produced floppy drives that could write 40 tracks to most 5¼-inch disks, yielding 160&#160;KB of storage per disk, but the format did not catch on widely, and no known software was published on 40-track media. Most drives, even Disk IIs, could write 36 tracks; simple modifications to DOS for formatting the extra track were common.</p>
<p>Incidentally, although the Apple Disk II stored 140&#160;KB on single-sided, "single-density" floppy disks, it was very common for Apple II users to extend the capacity of a floppy disk to 280&#160;KB -- by cutting out a write-protect notch on the side of the disk using a "disk notcher" (although a simple hole puncher would do) and inserting the disk flipped over. Early on, diskette manufacturers routinely warned that this technique would damage the read/write head of the drives or wear out the disk faster, and these warnings were frequently repeated in magazines of the day; in reality, this method was a quite reliable way to store twice as much data for the same amount of money, and was widely used for commercially released floppies as well.</p>
<p>Later, Apple IIs were able to use 3½-inch disks with a total capacity of 800&#160;KB and hard disks. DOS 3.3 did not support these drives natively; third-party software was required, and disks larger than about 400&#160;KB had to be split up into multiple "virtual disk volumes." <a href="/wiki/ProDOS.html" title="ProDOS">ProDOS</a>, a 1983 descendent of the Apple ///'s SOS, became the Apple II operating system of choice for users with these larger disks thanks to its native support of volumes up to 32&#160;MB in size and the fact that AppleWorks required it.</p>

<h3>Renditions of the "II" name</h3>
<p>The "II" portion of the Apple II name was rendered in a variety of creative ways using punctuation symbols on the front lids of the computers, and most printed material followed this lead. The II and the "unenhanced" IIe were labeled ][ and ][e, and the II<small>GS</small> and II<small>c</small> Plus were rendered in <a href="/wiki/Small_caps.html" title="Small caps">small caps</a>. The <a href="/wiki/Apple_///.html" title="Apple ///">Apple ///</a>, IIc, and later IIe models used slashes: ///, //c and //e. There have been some errors in the Apple II's name due to the numerous variations and forms on the "II".</p>

<p>Today, <a href="/wiki/Apple_II_emulators.html" title="Apple II emulators">emulators</a> for various Apple II models are available to run Apple II software on the <a href="/wiki/Mac_OS.html" title="Mac OS">Mac OS</a>/<a href="/wiki/Mac_OS_X.html" title="Mac OS X">Mac OS X</a>, <a href="/wiki/Linux.html" title="Linux">Linux</a>, <a href="/wiki/Microsoft_Windows.html" title="Microsoft Windows">Microsoft Windows</a>, and other operating systems. Numerous <a href="/wiki/Disk_image.html" title="Disk image">disk images</a> of Apple II software are available free over the <a href="/wiki/Internet.html" title="Internet">Internet</a> for use with these emulators. However, many emulators cannot run software on copy-protected media, or can run only software employing fairly simple protection schemes, unless somebody "<a href="/wiki/Software_cracking.html" title="Software cracking">cracks</a>" (removes the copy restrictions from) the software. Cracked software was widely pirated in the Apple II's heyday (with commercial cracking software such as the popular "Copy II+" program being sold in stores with the purpose of "creating legitimate back-ups" of protected software), and some of it is still available if you know where to look, although this is of questionable legality. For those who prefer to obtain their old software on the up-and-up, the <a  class="new" title="Lost Classics Project">Lost Classics Project</a> had as its goal convincing copyright holders of classic Apple II software to officially allow unrestricted free distribution of their software and has "freed" a number of programs.</p>

<h3>Industry impact</h3>
<p>The Apple II series of computers had an enormous impact on the technology industry and on everyday life. The Apple II was the first computer many people ever saw, and its price was within the reach of many middle-class families. Its popularity bootstrapped the entire <a href="/wiki/Computer_game.html" title="Computer game">computer game</a> and <a href="/wiki/Educational_software.html" title="Educational software">educational software</a> markets and began the boom in the <a href="/wiki/Word_processor.html" title="Word processor">word processor</a> and <a href="/wiki/Computer_printer.html" title="Computer printer">computer printer</a> markets. The first microcomputer "<a href="/wiki/Killer_app.html" title="Killer app">killer app</a>" for business was <a href="/wiki/VisiCalc.html" title="VisiCalc">VisiCalc</a>, the earliest <a href="/wiki/Spreadsheet.html" title="Spreadsheet">spreadsheet</a>, and it ran first on the Apple II; many businesses bought Apple IIs just to run VisiCalc, because it was the only spreadsheet available at the time. Apple's success in the home market inspired competitive <a href="/wiki/Home_computer.html" title="Home computer">home computers</a> such as the <a href="/wiki/Commodore_VIC-20.html" title="Commodore VIC-20">VIC-20</a> (1980) and <a href="/wiki/Commodore_64.html" title="Commodore 64">Commodore 64</a> (1982). Through their significantly lower price point, these models introduced the computer to several million more home users, acquiring some of Apple's market share in the process.</p>
<p>The success of the Apple II in business spurred <a href="/wiki/IBM.html" title="IBM">IBM</a> to create the <a href="/wiki/IBM_PC.html" title="IBM PC">IBM PC</a>, which was then purchased by middle managers in all lines of business to run spreadsheet and word processing software, at first ported from Apple II versions; later, whole new application software dynasties would be founded on the PC. The popularity of these PCs and their <a href="/wiki/IBM_PC_compatible.html" title="IBM PC compatible">clones</a> then transformed business again with <a href="/wiki/Local_area_network.html" title="Local area network">LAN</a> applications such as <a href="/wiki/E-mail.html" title="E-mail">e-mail</a> and later Internet applications such as <a href="/wiki/Usenet.html" title="Usenet">Usenet</a> and the <a href="/wiki/World_Wide_Web.html" title="World Wide Web">WWW</a>.</p>
<p>One valuable lesson from the Apple II was the importance of an open architecture to the success of a computer platform. The first Apple IIs shipped with an <i>Apple II Reference Manual</i> containing a complete schematic of the entire computer's circuitry and a complete source listing of the "Monitor" ROM firmware that served as the machine's <a href="/wiki/BIOS.html" title="BIOS">BIOS</a>. (Later, this guide had to be purchased separately, and in the case of the Apple II<small>GS</small>, the full technical documentation ran to several volumes.) The Apple II's slots, allowing any peripheral card to take control of the bus and directly access memory, enabled an independent industry of card manufacturers who together created a flood of hardware products that let users build systems that were far more powerful and useful (at a lower cost) than any competing system, most of which were not nearly as expandable and were universally proprietary. Even the game port was unusually powerful and could be used for digital and analog input and output; <a href="/wiki/Don_Lancaster.html" title="Don Lancaster">one hacker</a> used it to drive a <a href="/wiki/LaserWriter.html" title="LaserWriter">LaserWriter</a> printer.</p>
<p>Apple decided not to create an open architecture with the initial <a href="/wiki/Apple_Macintosh.html" title="Apple Macintosh">Macintosh</a> models, and this is widely seen as having hobbled its success; however, the <a href="/wiki/IBM_PC.html" title="IBM PC">IBM PC</a> provides an object lesson that success for the platform does not necessarily equate to success for the company that invented it. In the end, the IBM PC's off-the-shelf, open architecture allowed <a href="/wiki/IBM_PC_compatible.html" title="IBM PC compatible">clones</a> to be manufactured by startup competitors such as <a href="/wiki/Compaq.html" title="Compaq">Compaq</a>, <a href="/wiki/Dell%2C_Inc..html" title="Dell, Inc.">Dell</a> and <a href="/wiki/Gateway_Computers.html" title="Gateway Computers">Gateway</a>, leading to a <a href="/wiki/Pyrrhic_victory.html" title="Pyrrhic victory">Pyrrhic victory</a> for IBM and, eventually, the company's abandonment of the personal computer business in 2005.</p>
