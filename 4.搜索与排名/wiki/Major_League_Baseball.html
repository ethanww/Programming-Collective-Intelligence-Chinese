<p><b>Major League Baseball</b> (<b>MLB</b>) is the highest level of play in professional <a href="/wiki/Baseball.html" title="Baseball">baseball</a> in the world. More specifically, Major League Baseball refers to the entity that operates <a href="/wiki/North_America.html" title="North America">North American</a> professional baseball's two major leagues, the <a href="/wiki/National_League.html" title="National League">National League</a> and the <a href="/wiki/American_League.html" title="American League">American League</a>, by means of a joint organizational structure which has existed between them since <a href="/wiki/1903_in_baseball.html" title="1903 in baseball">1903</a>. On an organizational level, MLB effectively operates as a single "league", and as such it constitutes one of the <a href="/wiki/Major_professional_sports_league.html" title="Major professional sports league">major professional sports leagues</a> of North America.</p>
<p>Major League Baseball is governed by the <a href="/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_Constitution.html" title="Major League Baseball Constitution">Major League Baseball Constitution</a>, an agreement that has undergone several incarnations since <a href="/wiki/1876_in_baseball.html" title="1876 in baseball">1876</a> then called the <a href="/wiki/NL_Constitution.html" title="NL Constitution">NL Constitution</a>, with the most recent revisions being made in <a href="/wiki/2005_in_baseball.html" title="2005 in baseball">2005</a>. Major League Baseball, under the direction of its <a href="/wiki/Commissioner_of_Baseball.html" title="Commissioner of Baseball">Commissioner</a>, <a href="/wiki/Bud_Selig.html" title="Bud Selig">Bud Selig</a>, hires and maintains the sport's <a href="/wiki/Umpire_%28baseball%29.html" title="Umpire (baseball)">umpiring</a> crews, and negotiates <a href="/wiki/Marketing.html" title="Marketing">marketing</a>, labor, and <a href="/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_television_contracts.html" title="Major League Baseball television contracts">television contracts</a>. As is the case for most North American sports leagues, the 'closed shop' aspect of MLB effectively prevents the yearly promotion and demotion of teams into the Major League by virtue of their performance.</p>
<p>MLB as well maintains a unique, controlling relationship over the sport, including most aspects of <a href="/wiki/Minor_league_baseball.html" title="Minor league baseball">minor league baseball</a>. This is due in large part to a <a href="/wiki/1922.html" title="1922">1922</a> <a href="/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States.html" title="Supreme Court of the United States">U.S. Supreme Court</a> ruling in <i><a href="/wiki/Federal_Baseball_Club_v._National_League.html" title="Federal Baseball Club v. National League">Federal Baseball Club v. National League</a></i> which declared baseball is not considered <a href="/wiki/Interstate_commerce.html" title="Interstate commerce">interstate commerce</a> (and therefore not subject to federal <a href="/wiki/Antitrust.html" title="Antitrust">antitrust</a> law), despite baseball's own references to itself as an "industry" rather than a "sport."</p>
<p>The production/multimedia wing of MLB is New York-based <a href="/wiki/MLBAM.html" title="MLBAM">MLB Advanced Media</a> , which oversees <a href="/wiki/MLB.com.html" title="MLB.com">MLB.com</a> and all 30 of the individual teams' websites. Its charter states that MLB Advanced Media holds editorial independence from the League itself, but it is indeed under the same ownership group and revenue-sharing plan. MLB Productions is a similarly-structured wing of the league, focusing on video and traditional broadcast media.</p>

<h3>Teams and schedule</h3>
<p>At the time of writing, the Commissioner of Baseball, <a href="/wiki/Bud_Selig.html" title="Bud Selig">Bud Selig</a>, has often floated the idea of international expansion and realignment of the major leagues. At the moment, however, the two major leagues are each split into three divisions and structured as listed in the tables above.</p>
<p>In all, there are 30 teams in the two leagues: 16 in the older <a href="/wiki/National_League.html" title="National League">National League</a> ("NL") and 14 in the <a href="/wiki/American_League.html" title="American League">American League</a> ("AL"). The leagues do not have the same number of teams because 15 teams in each league would force interleague play (or rest days) every day. Each has its teams split into three divisions grouped generally by geography. They are (number of teams in each division in parenthesis): <a href="/wiki/National_League_East.html" title="National League East">NL East</a> (5), <a href="/wiki/National_League_Central.html" title="National League Central">NL Central</a> (6), <a href="/wiki/National_League_West.html" title="National League West">NL West</a> (5), <a href="/wiki/American_League_East.html" title="American League East">AL East</a> (5), <a href="/wiki/American_League_Central.html" title="American League Central">AL Central</a> (5), and <a href="/wiki/American_League_West.html" title="American League West">AL West</a> (4).</p>
<p>Each team's regular season consists of 162 games, a duration established in <a href="/wiki/1961_in_baseball.html" title="1961 in baseball">1961</a> in the American League and <a href="/wiki/1962_in_baseball.html" title="1962 in baseball">1962</a> in the National League. From <a href="/wiki/1904_in_baseball.html" title="1904 in baseball">1904</a> into the early 1960s, except for <a href="/wiki/1919_in_baseball.html" title="1919 in baseball">1919</a>, a 154-game schedule was played in both leagues (7 opponents X 22 games apiece). Expansion from 8 to 10 teams in each league in the early 1960s resulted in a revised schedule of 162 games (9 opponents X 18 games apiece, initially) in their expansion years, for the American League in 1961 and the National League in 1962. Although the schedule remains at 162 games to this day, the layout of games played was changed when Divisional play began in <a href="/wiki/1969_in_baseball.html" title="1969 in baseball">1969</a>, so that teams played more games against opponents within their own division than against the other division or (beginning in <a href="/wiki/1997_in_baseball.html" title="1997 in baseball">1997</a>) the other league.</p>
<p>Unplanned shortened seasons were played in <a href="/wiki/1918_in_baseball.html" title="1918 in baseball">1918</a> due to the United States entering <a href="/wiki/World_War_I.html" title="World War I">World War I</a>, and in <a href="/wiki/1972_in_baseball.html" title="1972 in baseball">1972</a>, <a href="/wiki/1981_in_baseball.html" title="1981 in baseball">1981</a>, <a href="/wiki/1994_in_baseball.html" title="1994 in baseball">1994</a> and <a href="/wiki/1995_in_baseball.html" title="1995 in baseball">1995</a> due to <a href="/wiki/Baseball_strike.html" title="Baseball strike">player strikes and lockouts</a>. A 140-game schedule (7 X 20) was played in 1919, and the schedule before 1904 varied from year to year.</p>
<p>Games are played predominantly against teams within each league through an unbalanced schedule which heavily favors intra-divisional play. In <a href="/wiki/1997_in_baseball.html" title="1997 in baseball">1997</a>, Major League Baseball introduced <a href="/wiki/Interleague_play.html" title="Interleague play">interleague play</a>, which was criticized by the sport's purists but has since proven very popular with most fans. The interleague games are confined to the mid-summer months. Typically many intra-division games are scheduled toward the end of the season, anticipating the possibility of close divisional races and heightened fan interest.</p>
<p>Each year in June, Major League Baseball conducts a <a href="/wiki/MLB_Draft.html" title="MLB Draft">draft</a> for first-year players who have never signed a Major or Minor League contract. The <a href="/wiki/MLB_Draft.html" title="MLB Draft">MLB Draft</a> is among the least followed of the professional sports drafts in the <a href="/wiki/United_States.html" title="United States">United States</a>.</p>

<p><a name="Team_names" id="Team_names"></a></p>
<h3>Team names</h3>
<p>In American professional sports, there is a kind of standardized structure for the names of individual clubs. The structure involves two elements, the first being a <b>geographical designator</b>, usually the name of a city, and a <b>nickname</b>. This is in contrast to non-American sports, such as European soccer, in which team names need not necessarily follow a particular pattern, or Asian professional baseball, which generally follows a "corporate sponsor" name followed by a "nickname." The pattern began with National League clubs and has been extended from there to almost all U.S. professional clubs.</p>
<p>Originally, gentlemen's clubs and gentlemen's athletic clubs were key movers in the development of organized baseball, so early prominent teams were simply named after the clubs that formed them: Athletic Club, Mutual Club, Olympic Club, Forest City Club, Kekionga Club, Atlantic Club, Western Club. By 1871, with the formation of the <a href="/wiki/National_Association.html" title="National Association">National Association</a>, clubs no longer just competed with local rivals, but with the best clubs from other cities around the northeast. Thus, geographic designators were added, establishing the now familiar pattern (only reversed): Athletics of Philadelphia, Mutuals of New York, Olympics of Washington, Forest Citys of Cleveland, Kekiongas of Fort Wayne, Atlantics of Brooklyn, Westerns of Keokuk.</p>
<p>By 1876, when the National League entered play, baseball clubs were no longer primarily associated with gentlemen's clubs, and most of the original teams were named after the one uniform feature that served to distinguish them on the field -- the color of their stockings. Thus: Boston Red Stockings, Chicago White Stockings, Cincinnati Red Stockings, Hartford Dark Blues, Louisville Grays, St. Louis Brown Stockings (the 1876 New York and Philadelphia clubs still held over the traditional "Mutuals" and "Athletics" names).</p>
<p>Throughout this period, club nicknames were ad hoc, and bestowed and used at will by sports writers and fans. Nicknames became associated with particular cities, and fans tended to refer to the local team by this name, even if it was not associated in a corporate fashion with its predecessor. Thus, multiple, unassociated teams used names such as Boston Red Stockings, Chicago White Stockings, Cincinnati Red Stockings, St. Louis Brown Stockings, Louisville Grays, Baltimore Orioles, and the like.</p>
<p>In the 20th century, the club nickname acquired an official status, being designated by the club ownership. However, this has not always been the case. At least three times in the early 20th century, club officials tried to change the common nickname for a club, but the press and the public largely ignored the change and the older, more popular name remained in use. Some examples include team officials changing "<a href="/wiki/Boston_Braves.html" title="Boston Braves">Boston Braves</a>" to "Boston Bees"; and "<a href="/wiki/Philadelphia_Phillies.html" title="Philadelphia Phillies">Philadelphia Phillies</a>" to "Philadelphia Blue Jays," both of which never caught on. Additionally, the original <a href="/wiki/Washington_Senators.html" title="Washington Senators">Washington Senators</a> were officially the "Washington Nationals" from <a href="/wiki/1905.html" title="1905">1905</a> onward, but use of the "Nationals" name was rare and the team officially became the "Senators" after the <a href="/wiki/1956.html" title="1956">1956</a> season.</p>

<p><a name="Major_League_Baseball_uniforms" id="Major_League_Baseball_uniforms"></a></p>
<h3>Major League Baseball uniforms</h3>
<p>The official rules of Major League Baseball require that all players on a team wear matching uniforms.</p>
<p>Traditionally, when playing at home, teams wore uniforms that were mostly white with trim in team colors and when playing away, they wore uniforms that were mostly gray with trim in team colors. Aside from the obvious need to distinguish one team from the other, conventional wisdom held that it was more difficult to properly launder uniforms while on a road trip, thus the "road grays" helped to hide accumulated soil. This convention continued well after its original premise was nullified by the issuance of multiple uniforms and the growth of the <a href="/wiki/Laundromat.html" title="Laundromat">laundromat</a> industry. Starting in the 1970s, with the advent of synthetic fabrics, teams began using more color in their uniforms, notably the <a href="/wiki/Oakland_Athletics.html" title="Oakland Athletics">Oakland Athletics</a> in the early 1970s and the <a href="/wiki/Rainbow_Guts.html" title="Rainbow Guts">Houston Astros</a> in the mid-1970s. In the late 1970s, the <a href="/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates.html" title="Pittsburgh Pirates">Pittsburgh Pirates</a> began a trend of multiple combinations of differently colored jerseys and trousers and caps (with the options of black, yellow, and white with pin stripes).</p>
<p>Starting in the 1990s, MLB clubs began heavily marketing licensed goods, such as caps and uniform jerseys to the public and this has resulted in a wide array of uniforms for each team. Now, some teams have not only a basic home uniform and away uniform, but also special "Sunday game" uniforms and uniforms that are worn only during batting practice and uniforms worn on singular events. On several occasions, the MLB has instituted nostalgia events, during which teams wore uniforms from the past.</p>
<p>The result is that it is now often difficult to say which uniform is a team's "official" one. For example, the <a href="/wiki/Cincinnati_Reds.html" title="Cincinnati Reds">Cincinnati Reds</a> now wear a variety of caps: all red, red crown and black bill, black crown and red bill, and all black. In contrast from the pre-1990s era, in which there usually was just one home uniform and one road uniform (with certain exceptions, such as Oakland and Pittsburgh's complex combinations), today choices of what combination of uniform elements are worn are now sometimes left up to players. In some cases, aspects of the uniform that are considered official are now rarely worn, such as the <a href="/wiki/New_York_Mets.html" title="New York Mets">New York Mets</a>' all-blue home cap, which is rarely seen on the field today in favor of an "alternate" black-and-blue cap.</p>
<p>The official rules state that:</p>
<ul>
<li>All players on a team must wear identical uniforms during a single game.</li>
<li><b>Numbers</b>: All players must wear their uniform numbers on the back of the uniform</li>
<li><b>Undershirt</b>: If the undershirt is exposed then all the players on the team must wear matching ones. Numbers or other devices may be worn on the sleeve of the undershirt (for example, if it is worn with a sleeveless jersey), except that pitchers may not have such devices on their undershirt sleeves.</li>
<li>The league office might require that each team have a single uniform for all games or requires that each team have a single, white home uniform and a single, non-white away uniform. With the elimination of the separate American League and National League administrations, it is unknown what the effectiveness of this rule now is.</li>
<li><b>Sleeve length</b>: The rules allow for minor variation in sleeve length, but they must be "approximately the same length" and the sleeves may not be "ragged, frayed or slit."</li>
<li><b>No attachments</b>: Tape or other attachments of non-matching color may not be used on uniforms.</li>

Milwaukee logo (1978-1993) used apparently in violation of MLB rules (violation was no "pattern that imitates or suggests the shape of a baseball")</div>
</div>
</div>
<ul>
<li><b>No images of baseballs</b>: No "pattern that imitates or suggests the shape of a baseball" may be used on uniforms. Notably, in apparent violation of this rule, the <a href="/wiki/Milwaukee_Brewers.html" title="Milwaukee Brewers">Milwaukee Brewers</a> for many years had a logo that incorporated the image of a baseball, and the logo has made a comeback in 2006 on the hats of the Brewers' Sunday home uniforms. (The purpose of this rule is to prevent one team from deceiving the other. The <a href="/wiki/National_Football_League.html" title="National Football League">National Football League</a> has a similar rule, which states that no pattern that imitates or suggests the shape of a football.)</li>
<li><b>No glass buttons or polished metal</b></li>
<li><b>No commercial advertisements</b> on uniforms. This rule is in variance with professional sports, especially outside the United States (notably <a href="/wiki/Soccer.html" title="Soccer">soccer</a>), in which it is customary for uniforms to prominently display the logo of a sponsoring company.</li>
<li><b>Names</b>: "A league may provide that the uniforms of its member teams include the names of its players on their backs. Any name other than the last name of the player must be approved by the League President. If adopted, all uniforms for a team must have the names of its players." Again, with the elimination of separate administrations for the American and National leagues, it is unknown what the provenance of this rule is. (Currently, <a href="/wiki/Ichiro_Suzuki.html" title="Ichiro Suzuki">Ichiro Suzuki</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Seattle_Mariners.html" title="Seattle Mariners">Seattle Mariners</a> is the only player to have his first name on the back his uniform. <a href="/wiki/Vida_Blue.html" title="Vida Blue">Vida Blue</a> also used his first name on the back of his uniform when he played for the <a href="/wiki/San_Francisco_Giants.html" title="San Francisco Giants">San Francisco Giants</a> in the mid-1980s).

</ul>
<p>On game days that do not require a special uniform (either by team or MLB request) it is generally (but not always) the starting pitcher for a team that chooses the uniform to be worn for that day's game.</p>

<p><a name="All-Star_Game" id="All-Star_Game"></a></p>
<h3>All-Star Game</h3>
<p>Early July marks the midway point of the season, during which a three day break is taken when the <a href="/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game.html" title="Major League Baseball All-Star Game">Major League Baseball All-Star Game</a> is staged. The All-Star game pits players from the NL, headed up by the manager of the previous NL <a href="/wiki/World_Series.html" title="World Series">World Series</a> team, against players from the AL, similarly managed, in an exhibition game. The <a href="/wiki/2002_in_baseball.html" title="2002 in baseball">2002</a> contest ended in an 11-inning tie because both teams were out of pitchers, a result which proved highly unpopular with the fans. As a result, for a two-year trial in <a href="/wiki/2003_in_baseball.html" title="2003 in baseball">2003</a> and <a href="/wiki/2004_in_baseball.html" title="2004 in baseball">2004</a>, the league which won the game received the benefit of home-field advantage (four of the seven games of that year's World Series taking place at their home park). The 2005 contest, played in <a href="/wiki/Detroit%2C_Michigan.html" title="Detroit, Michigan">Detroit</a>, followed this format, and it is expected that it will remain that way until the MLB says otherwise, since it has become popular with fans but has upset purists over the previous format of the two leagues alternating home-field advantage every other year. The Boston Red Sox and Chicago White Sox took some advantage of the rule in 2004 and 2005 respectively, as each team started the Series with two home victories, giving them good momentum for a sweep. The rule did not help the Yankees in 2003, as they lost the Series to Florida in 6 games.</p>
<p>Since the <a href="/wiki/1970s.html" title="1970s">1970s</a>, the eight position players for each team who take the field initially have been voted into the game by fans. The remaining position players and all of the pitchers on each league's roster were, for a large number of years, solely at the discretion of that team's manager. In <a href="/wiki/2004_in_baseball.html" title="2004 in baseball">2004</a>, however, MLB instituted a system where some reserves and pitchers were selected by a vote of MLB players, and some were selected by the manager after consulting with the Commissioner's Office. Each person is allowed to vote 25 times. By MLB regulation, every team in the majors must have at least one designated all-star player, regardless of voting. This rule exists so that fans of every team have a player to watch for in the All-Star Game. The 2007 All-Star Game will be played in San Francisco at AT&amp;T Park.</p>

<h3>Post-season</h3>
<p>When the regular season ends after the first Sunday in October (or the last Sunday in September), eight teams enter the post-season playoffs. Six teams are division champions; the remaining two "wild-card" spots are filled by the team in each league that has the best record but is not a division champion (best second-place team). Three rounds of series of games are played to determine the champion:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="/wiki/American_League_Division_Series.html" title="American League Division Series">American League Division Series</a> and <a href="/wiki/National_League_Division_Series.html" title="National League Division Series">National League Division Series</a>, each a best-of-five game series;</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/American_League_Championship_Series.html" title="American League Championship Series">American League Championship Series</a> and <a href="/wiki/National_League_Championship_Series.html" title="National League Championship Series">National League Championship Series</a>, each a best-of-seven game series played between the surviving teams from the ALDS and NLDS; and</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/World_Series.html" title="World Series">World Series</a>, a best-of-seven game series played between the champions of each league.</li>
</ol>
<p>The division winners are seeded 1-3 based on record. The wild-card team is the 4 seed, regardless of its record. The matchup for the first round of the playoffs is usually 1 seed vs. 4 seed and 2 seed vs. 3 seed, unless the wild-card team is from the same division as the 1 seed, in which case the matchup is 1 seed vs. 3 seed and 2 seed vs. 4 seed, as teams from the same division cannot meet in the 1st round. In the first and second round of the playoffs, the better seeded team has home-field advantage, regardless of record.</p>
<p>In the event of a tie in the standings at the close of the regular season, league rules provide for a one-game playoff (with the home field determined by coin flip) to determine which of two teams participate in the Division Series. If three teams are involved in a tie, a two-game playoff may be played. If two teams are tied, but a tiebreaker would result in both participating in the Division Series anyway (due to one being division champion and the other being wild card), then no playoff is played and seedings are determined by head-to-head record.</p>
<p>The team belonging to the league that won the mid-season All-Star Game receives home-field advantage in the World Series.</p>

<p><a name="MLB_steroid_policy" id="MLB_steroid_policy"></a></p>
<h3>MLB steroid policy</h3>
<p>Over most of the course of Major League Baseball, steroid testing was never a major issue. However, after the <a href="/wiki/BALCO.html" title="BALCO">BALCO</a> <a href="/wiki/Anabolic_steroid.html" title="Anabolic steroid">steroid</a> scandal, which involved allegations that top baseball players had used illegal performance-enhancing drugs, Major League Baseball finally decided to issue harsher penalties for steroid users. The policy, which was accepted by Major League Baseball players and owners, was issued at the start of the 2005 season and went as follows:</p>
<p>A first positive test resulted in a suspension of 10 games, a second positive test resulted in a suspension of 30 games, the third positive test resulted in a suspension of 60 games, the fourth positive test resulted in a suspension of one full year, and a fifth positive test resulted in a penalty at the commissioner’s discretion. Players were tested at least once per year, with the chance that several players could be tested many times per year. (See: <a href="/wiki/List_of_Major_League_Baseball_players_suspended_for_steroids.html" title="List of Major League Baseball players suspended for steroids">List of Major League Baseball players suspended for steroids</a>)</p>
<p>This program replaced the previous steroid testing program under which, for example, no player was even suspended in 2004. Under the old policy, which was established in 2002, a first-time offense would only result in treatment for the player, and the player would not even be named. The 2005 agreement changed this rule so that first-time offenders were named and suspended.</p>
<p>In November 2005, MLB owners and players approved even tougher penalties for positive tests than the ones in place during the 2005 season. Under the new rules, a first positive test would result in a 50-game suspension, a second positive test would result in a 100-game suspension, and a third positive test would result in a lifetime suspension from MLB.</p>
<p>These new penalties are much harsher than the previous ones. The new steroid policy finally brings MLB closer in line with international rules, as well as with the <a href="/wiki/NFL.html" title="NFL">NFL</a>, which has long taken a tough stance on those caught using steroids.</p>
<p>MLB's previous reluctance to take a hard line on drugs (as many other sports featured far stricter testing and penalties) was widely seen as one of the main reasons why baseball has been dropped from the <a href="/wiki/Olympic_Games.html" title="Olympic Games">Olympics</a>, effective in <a href="/wiki/2012_Summer_Olympics.html" title="2012 Summer Olympics">2012</a>.</p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/March_30.html" title="March 30">March 30</a>, <a href="/wiki/2006_in_baseball.html" title="2006 in baseball">2006</a>, <a href="/wiki/Bud_Selig.html" title="Bud Selig">Bud Selig</a> launched an investigation on the alleged steriod use by players such as <a href="/wiki/Barry_Bonds.html" title="Barry Bonds">Barry Bonds</a>, <a href="/wiki/Jason_Giambi.html" title="Jason Giambi">Jason Giambi</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Gary_Sheffield.html" title="Gary Sheffield">Gary Sheffield</a> as the weight of books like <i><a href="/wiki/Game_of_Shadows.html" title="Game of Shadows">Game of Shadows</a></i> emerged. The inquiry into steroids' use in baseball is expected to go back no further than 2002, when the MLB started testing players for performance-enhancing drugs.</p>

<h3>MLB blackout policy</h3>
<p>Major League Baseball has several <a href="/wiki/Blackout_%28broadcasting%29.html" title="Blackout (broadcasting)">blackout</a> rules. Games are blacked out based on two criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>A local broadcaster has priority to televise games from the team in their market over national broadcasters. For example, <a href="/wiki/TBS_%28TV_network%29.html" title="TBS (TV network)">TBS</a> shows many <a href="/wiki/Atlanta_Braves.html" title="Atlanta Braves">Atlanta Braves</a> games nationally and internationally in Canada. <a href="/wiki/Fox_Sports_Net.html" title="Fox Sports Net">Fox Sports Net</a> (FSN) also shows many games in other areas. If the Braves play a team that FSN or another local broadcaster shows, the local station has the rights for their own local market, TBS will be blacked out for the duration of the game for everyone in the zip code of the market of the team playing against the Braves. A market that has a local team playing in a weekday <a href="/wiki/ESPN.html" title="ESPN">ESPN</a> or <a href="/wiki/ESPN2.html" title="ESPN2">ESPN2</a> game and is shown on a local station will see <a href="/wiki/ESPNEWS.html" title="ESPNEWS">ESPNEWS</a>, another game scheduled on ESPN or ESPN2 at the same time (if ESPN or ESPN2 operates a regional coverage broadcasting and operates a game choice), or will be subject to an alternative programming feed.</li>

<li><a href="/wiki/Fox_Broadcasting_Company.html" title="Fox Broadcasting Company">FOX</a> has certain rights for afternoon MLB games on Saturdays, and <a href="/wiki/ESPN.html" title="ESPN">ESPN</a> has the same rights for night games on Sundays. Broadcasters cannot show games of in-market teams regardless of if the game is home or away if the game of the local team has a certain start time (usually there are no other games scheduled at these times). This is to make people watch the out of market game on ESPN or FOX. The reasoning is that since people will not be able to watch their favorite team, they may be willing to settle for some baseball, even if it involves teams they are not as exicted about. This results in higher ratings for the national broadcaster by pulling baseball fans away from watching their own team.</li>

<p>It was announced on <a href="/wiki/July_11.html" title="July 11">July 11</a>, <a href="/wiki/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> that <a href="/wiki/Fox_Sports_%28USA%29.html" title="Fox Sports (USA)">FOX Sports</a> will remain with MLB through <a  class="new" title="2013 in baseball">2013</a> and broadcast <i><a href="/wiki/Fox_Broadcasting_Company.html" title="Fox Broadcasting Company">FOX</a> Saturday Baseball</i> throughout the entire season, rather than the current May to September format.

<h2>Historical major leagues</h2>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/1969.html" title="1969">1969</a>, the official centennial of professional baseball, the Special Baseball Records Committee appointed by Major League Baseball recognized six "major leagues" in history, four defunct and two still in operation.</p>

</ul>
<p>Some researchers contend that some other leagues deserve "major league" status, too.</p>

</ul>
<p>Indeed, the <i>Official Encyclopedia of Baseball</i> published in 1951 (a jubilee year) and revised since then recognized the <a href="/wiki/NA_as_a_major_league.html" title="NA as a major league">NA as a major league</a>. National Association. But a new <i>Baseball Encyclopedia</i> project made possible by the digital computer promised publication of far more detailed playing records.</p>
<p>In general, the SBRC ruled that the other leagues kept playing records inconsistently or lacked significant direct impact on the major leagues.</p>
<p>Specifically, the following can be said of these leagues:</p>
<ul>
<li>The National Association was the direct precursor of the NL, six of whose eight charter members came from the NA of 1875, and it is generally considered the first professional league. The standard position is that it was a "transitional" organization not quite up to major league standards. The NL was a wholly new entity that took the best of the NA and imposed a discipline that was lacking in the failed NA.</li>
<li>The AL of 1900 was located in four only of the eight cities it would be occupy in the following year. It accepted minor status and did not conduct raids on major league rosters. That changed in 1901.</li>
<li>The Negro Leagues are the toughest call. Some historians have labeled their time the era of "shadow ball", a segregated parallel to the (all-white) major leagues. The fact that many young players were able to enter MLB in the late 1940s and early 1950s, and have immediate impact, argues for major status in one sense. On the other hand, it may be argued that the Negro Leagues were closer in quality of play to the highest levels of minor league ball such as the <a href="/wiki/Pacific_Coast_League.html" title="Pacific Coast League">Pacific Coast League</a>. It is a debate that has no clear resolution, which is why most historians are content to simply regard them as a category unto themselves.</li>
</ul>
<p>At the same time, some historians question whether the <a href="/wiki/Union_Association.html" title="Union Association">Union Association</a> of 1884 should be considered "major", because it had only one major-league caliber team (St. Louis) and several clubs failed during the season mid-season, others taking their places. Beside that MLB recognition which the Unions enjoy as a matter of fact, any argument for major status rests chiefly on the Union Association's direct impact on the other majors, due to roster-raiding. None of the "non-major" other leagues listed here could make that claim.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/The_Sporting_News.html" title="The Sporting News">The Sporting News</a>, a weekly established in 1886 and later an important publisher of books, did not recognize the <a href="/wiki/Federal_League.html" title="Federal League">Federal League</a> of 1914-1915 for almost ninety years.</p>
