<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Nurses develop and implement a <a href="/wiki/Nursing_care_plan.html" title="Nursing care plan">plan of care</a> and work collaboratively with the patient, the patient's family and other health care professionals and para-professionals. In the <a href="/wiki/United_States.html" title="United States">U.S.</a> (and increasingly the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom.html" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>), <a href="/wiki/Advanced_practice_nurse.html" title="Advanced practice nurse">advanced practice nurses</a>, such as <a href="/wiki/Clinical_nurse_specialist.html" title="Clinical nurse specialist">clinical nurse specialists</a> and <a href="/wiki/Nurse_practitioner.html" title="Nurse practitioner">nurse practitioners</a>, diagnose health problems and prescribe <a href="/wiki/Medication.html" title="Medication">medications</a> and other therapies.</p>
<p>Nurses may help coordinate the patient care performed by other members of a health care team such as <a href="/wiki/Therapist.html" title="Therapist">therapists</a>, <a href="/wiki/Medicine.html" title="Medicine">medical</a> practitioners, <a href="/wiki/Social_worker.html" title="Social worker">social workers</a>, or <a href="/wiki/Dietitian.html" title="Dietitian">dietitians</a>. Nurses frequently act as <a  class="new" title="Patient advocate">patient advocate</a>.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Labor.html" title="United States Department of Labor">US Department of Labor's</a> revised Occupational Outlook Handbook (<a href="/wiki/2000.html" title="2000">2000</a>), "Registered nurses (R.N.s) work to promote health, prevent disease, and help patients cope with illness. They are advocates and health educators for patients, families, and communities. When providing direct patient care, they observe, assess, and record symptoms, responses, and progress; assist physicians during treatments and examinations; administer medications; and assist in convalescence and rehabilitation. R.N.s also develop and manage <a href="/wiki/Nursing_care_plan.html" title="Nursing care plan">nursing care plans</a>; instruct patients and their families in proper care; and help individuals and groups take steps to improve or maintain their health."</p>
<p>The nursing career structure varies considerably throughout the world. Typically there are several distinct levels of nursing practitioner, distinguished by increasing education, responsibility and skills. The major distinction is between task-based nursing and professional nursing.</p>
<p>In various parts of the world, the educational background for nurses varies widely. In some parts of eastern <a href="/wiki/Europe.html" title="Europe">Europe</a>, nurses are <a href="/wiki/High_school.html" title="High school">high school</a> graduates with twelve to eighteen months of training. In contrast, <a href="/wiki/Chile.html" title="Chile">Chile</a> requires any Registered Nurse to have at least a <a href="/wiki/Bachelor%27s_degree.html" title="Bachelor's degree">bachelor's degree</a>.</p>
<p>At the top of the educational ladder is the doctoral-prepared nurse. Nurses may gain the <a href="/wiki/PhD.html" title="PhD">PhD</a> or another <a href="/wiki/Doctorate.html" title="Doctorate">doctoral degree</a> such as <a href="/wiki/Doctor_of_Nursing_Science.html" title="Doctor of Nursing Science">Doctor of Nursing Science</a> (DNSc) or <a href="/wiki/Doctor_of_Nursing_Practice.html" title="Doctor of Nursing Practice">Doctor of Nursing Practice</a> (DNP), specializing in research, clinical nursing, etc. These nurses practice nursing, teach nursing and carry out nursing research. As the science and art of nursing has advanced, so has the demand for doctoral-prepared nurses.</p>
<p>Nursing as an occupation is one of the most female-dominated, especially in the United States, where in 1999 more than 90% of licensed practical nurses and registered nurses were women.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a  title="">[1]</a></sup> Nurses are the largest group of providers in the health care system.</p>

<h3>Legal regulation</h3>
<p>The practice of nursing is governed by state and territorial nursing regulation authorities. The <a  class="new" title="Australian Nursing and Midwifery Council">Australian Nursing and Midwifery Council</a> (ANMC) was established in 1992 and works with these authorities to facilitate a national approach to nursing and midwifery regulation.</p>

<h4>Types of nurses</h4>
<p>In all states other than <a href="/wiki/Victoria_%28Australia%29.html" title="Victoria (Australia)">Victoria</a>, nurses fall into the following major categories:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/wiki/Nurse_Practitioner.html" title="Nurse Practitioner">Nurse Practitioners</a> (NP)</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Registered_Nurse.html" title="Registered Nurse">Registered Nurse</a> (RN)</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Enrolled_Nurse.html" title="Enrolled Nurse">Enrolled Nurse</a> (EN)</li>
</ul>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Victoria">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Victoria" id="Victoria"></a></p>
<h4>Victoria</h4>
<p>Nurses and nursing were first regulated by statue in 1923 in Victoria. In 1993 the legislation was revised and all nurses are now termed Registered Nurse classified according to their educational preparation by the <a  class="external text" title="http://www.nbv.org.au">Nurses Board of Victoria</a> (NBV). Since December 2005 all Victorian health registration boards (including the NBV) are governed by the <a  class="external text" title="http://www.dms.dpc.vic.gov.au/Domino/Web_Notes/LDMS/Pubhome.nsf?OpenDatabase|"><i>Health Professions Registration Act</i> 2005</a>.</p>
<p><i>RN Division 1</i> are first level nurses comprehensively trained with the <i>potential</i> ability to work in any branch of nursing.</p>
<p><i>RN Division 2</i> are second level nurses that work under the direction of a Division 1 or 3 Nurse, equivalent to an <i>enrolled nurse</i> in other Australian states.</p>
<p><i>RN Division 3</i> are nurses formally trained <i>solely</i> in psychiatric nursing. This is not to be confused with general nurses who undertook "post basic" training in psychiatric nursing and were thus able to work in both general and psychiatric nursing settings.</p>
<p><i>RN Division 4</i> nurses formally trained <i>solely</i> in institutions that cared for people with an intellectual disability. It was possible (but unusual) for general nurses to undertake post basic training to attain this as an additional qualification. Mental retardation nursing (as it was then known) is no longer considered the sole domain of nursing, and courses are available such as the <a  class="external text" title="http://www.deakin.edu.au/courses/search/course.php?customer_cd=C&amp;service_item=H532&amp;version_number=1&amp;year_offered=2005|Graduate">Certificate of Disability Studies (Positive Behaviour Support)</a> designed to meet the needs of practitioners in a variety of disciplines.</p>
<p><i>RN Division 5</i> are Maternal and Child Welfare Nurses who had additional post basic training beyond that of the standard midwifery post-basic qualification.</p>
<p>Divisions <i>3,4 and 5</i> are now closed to new applicants. The effect of this policy is that there will be, in time, only Division One and Two nurses, with a separate foundation qualification pertaining to each type.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Midwifery">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Midwifery" id="Midwifery"></a></p>
<h3>Midwifery</h3>
<p>Unlike the United Kingdom, until relatively recently midwifery training required registration in nursing as a prerequisite. At least one course has been established that will qualify a person as a midwife, but not as a registered nurse.</p>
<p>Victoria ceased to list midwives in 1993 as a separate register on the presumption that all midwives were also registered nurses. However, in latter years Victoria now "recognises" additional qualifications provided they are Midwifery, Maternal &amp; Child Health Nursing or Psychiatric qualifications.</p>
<p>There is a philosophical argument that child birth and reproduction are natural conditions and should not be treated as a disease or ailment, and that since the "disease model" permeates nursing, midwifery is and should be considered a separate discipline. Opponents to this argument counter that many other speciality areas in nursing support a natural process such as palliative care.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it is likely that independent practice midwives will continue to develop as a profession despite the current issues relating to the availability of malpractice insurance.</p>

<p><a name="Nurse_Practitioners" id="Nurse_Practitioners"></a></p>
<h3>Nurse Practitioners</h3>
<p>Nurse Practitioners are being introduced into the Australian healthcare community.</p>
<p>In some instances it could be argued that this is as a natural professional evolution and recognition of the outstanding clinical expertise some nurses have attained over the course of their careers in areas such as wound management.</p>
<p>The formal recognition of nurse practitioners permits duly educated and credentialled health care nursing professionals with autonomous practice rights within their particular area of expertise. This may include (but not necessarily) drug prescription rights. The development of nurse practitioners is opposed by the <a  class="external text" title="http://www.ama.com.au/web.nsf/search?searchview&amp;query=Independent-Nurse-Practitioner&amp;searchorder=1&amp;opt=2&amp;searchfuzzy=true&amp;searchwv=true|Medical">Australian Medical Association Stand</a>.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Education">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Education" id="Education"></a></p>
<h3>Education</h3>
<p>Registration as a Registered Nurse now requires a Bachelor of Nursing, considered the foundation for any future specialisation within nursing. <a href="/wiki/Graduate_diploma.html" title="Graduate diploma">Postgraduate diplomas</a> provide further vocational training for specialist areas. Masters level courses are available in both research and course work streams; a specialist course has been developed to provide preparation for registration as a Nurse Practitioner. Professional doctorates are also available (ND).</p>
<p>Australia has a long tradition of post basic courses, usually of a 6 month (minor) or 12 month (major) duration, which included Midwifery, Maternal and Child Welfare, Psychiatric, Perioperative ("Theatre Nursing"), Intensive Care, and Coronary Care in later years, as well as a myriad of other courses. There are now provided by the university sector as <a href="/wiki/Postgraduate_diploma.html" title="Postgraduate diploma">postgraduate diplomas</a> or post graduate certificates, depending on the length and complexity.</p>
<p>There are options available for hospital trained nurses to upgrade their qualifications to a Bachelor of Nursing (post registration); however, most opt instead to undertake specialist courses such as a postgraduate diploma or certificate in the area of their clinical interest.</p>
<p>Enrolled nurses are trained in the TAFE sector of approximately 12 months duration. In some states the length has been increased to 18 months to include a module that permits enrolled nurses to dispense oral medications.</p>

<p><a name="Historical" id="Historical"></a></p>
<h4>Historical</h4>
<p>Prior to the transfer of nursing education to the university sector nurses were <i>trained</i> in a course of instruction in hospital nursing schools that awarded a certificate in General Nursing. These courses were generally for a three year period, and nurses were paid employees of the parent hospital. Hospitals awarded distinctive badges upon <i>graduation</i>. In addition, state registering authorities awarded a badge of <i>registration</i>. These were generally worn on the uniform collars.</p>
<p>It is interesting to note that as early as the 1930s, attempts were made to establish university credentialled nursing courses in Australia, most notably by then Director of Nursing at the Royal Melbourne Hospital and the University of Melbourne. As recently as the 1970s, Dr. Sandra Stacey, one of the first Australian nurses to attain a PhD enrolled in a school of anthropology to submit her thesis.</p>
<p>A comprehensive history regarding the development of nursing, including registration and education in New South Wales is available from <a  class="external text" title="http://www.nmb.nsw.gov.au/history.pdf|NSW">Nurses Board</a>.</p>
<p>In the late 1970s, the Royal College of Nursing Australia pioneered a course that became the <i>Diploma of Applied Science (Nursing)</i> awarded by the Lincoln Institute in Melbourne and Cumberland College in Sydney. The transfer of nursing education to the university sector continued throughout the 1980s, and gradually hospital schools ceased operating. In the early 1990s universities finally granted nursing education the same status as allied health and granted <a href="/wiki/Bachelor_degree.html" title="Bachelor degree">bachelor degrees</a> in nursing rather than <a href="/wiki/Diplomas.html" title="Diplomas">diplomas</a> for entry-level courses.</p>
<p>The first move towards baccalaureate recognition was the development of the <i>Bachelor of Applied Science (Advanced Nursing)</i>, a post graduate degree that required registration as a Registered Nurse as a prerequisite to admission and the completion of 16 units. This course is no longer offered, having been superseded by the transition of "post basic courses" conducted by various hospitals as a form of inservice training to the tertiary sector (see above).</p>
<p>The transfer of nursing education to the university sector from the hospital setting was the result of long-time efforts by leaders in Australian nursing. It was opposed by the medical hierarchy who viewed the development of a highly-trained professional nurses as a threat to their monopoly on the delivery of high-level health care. Many nurses themselves opposed the transfer on the grounds that "hands on experience in hospitals" would be lost. One underlying cause of the opposition was societal views of appropriate gender roles: nursing as a "female" profession and medicine as a "male" profession. These views are evolving.</p>
<p>Historically, a <i>"double"</i> or <i>"triple certificated sister"</i> would have been a registered nurse who held general, midwifery, psychiatric or other range of certificates. The post nominals <i>RN(DC)</i> or <i>RN(TC)</i> was used by some nurses to signify this attainment.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Professional titles">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Professional_titles" id="Professional_titles"></a></p>
<h4>Professional titles</h4>
<p>The professional courtesy title <i>"Sister"</i> has fallen into disuse and disapproval, even though it was formerly used by both male and female registered general nurses. The title <i>"Nurse"</i> was used when addressing enrolled nurses. The term "Matron" is inadvisable.</p>
<p>In keeping with the relaxed attitude to formalities in Australia, most nurses are happy to be addressed by their first name and describe themselves either as <i>"an RN"</i> or <i>"an EN".</i> In Victoria, an enrolled nurse will commonly describe themself as a <i>"Div. 2"</i>.</p>

<h3>Education</h3>
<p>New Zealand originally had nurse education as a part of the hospital system, but as early as the 1900's post registration and post graduate programmes of study for nurses were in existence. Reforms in the 1970s disestablished the original hospital based schools and moved these into the tertiary education sector, namely <a href="/wiki/Polytechnics.html" title="Polytechnics">Polytechnics</a> and <a href="/wiki/University.html" title="University">Universities</a>. Within the hospital system were an array of titles and levels, often focussing upon clinical speciality rather than generic nursing knowledge.</p>
<p>Today all nurses in New Zealand are educated to degree level via a three year, two semesters per annum, programme, with an approximate 50/50 mix of theory to practice. All current students graduate as a Registered Comprehensive Nurse. Legislation exists keeping the number of schools to no more than 21, although some schools run courses in more than one geographical location. Recently attempts were made to reintroduce the title <a href="/wiki/Enrolled_Nurse.html" title="Enrolled Nurse">enrolled nurse</a>, with this causing some disagreement between trade unions, the registering body and health providers.</p>

<p><a name="Legal_Regulation" id="Legal_Regulation"></a></p>
<h3>Legal Regulation</h3>
<p>All nurses in New Zealand are expected to maintain both professional knowledge and clinical competence in order to receive an annual practising certificate from the <a href="/wiki/Nursing_Council_of_New_Zealand.html" title="Nursing Council of New Zealand">Nursing Council of New Zealand</a> (NCNZ). Recent legislation (the 2004 Health Practitioners Competency Assurance Act) sets standards for both scope of practice and requirements in terms of ongoing development.</p>
<p>Similarly the NCNZ caused minor controversary when the gave the title <a href="/wiki/Nurse_practitioner.html" title="Nurse practitioner">nurse practitioner</a> <a href="/wiki/Trade_mark.html" title="Trade mark">trade mark</a> status, thus preventing those using the title from using it. In order to become a nurse practitioner the nurse must undertake an approved course of study and present a portfolio of evidence to NCNZ for approval. There are now approximately 20 NP's in New Zealand, with a smaller number granted prescribing rights.</p>

<h3>Ongoing Issues</h3>

This pay award was given to those employed within <a href="/wiki/District_health_boards.html" title="District health boards">district health boards</a> but not other public sector providers and caused a degree of conflict within the profession, with a return to hospital practice for many in the <a href="/wiki/Primary_health_care.html" title="Primary health care">primary healthcare</a> sector.

<h4>Pre-Project 2000</h4>
<p><b>Student Nurses</b></p>
<p>Before <a href="/wiki/Project_2000.html" title="Project 2000">Project 2000</a>, nurse education was the responsibility of teaching hospitals and local Schools of Nursing. Student nurses were salaried members of the health service. For example, for student RGNs, this would involve what was known as "rotational" or "modular" training, where the student would move to different specialities (for example, paediatrics, medical, surgical etc). At the end of their three (or two) years training, nurses were eligible to register with the <a href="/wiki/Nursing_and_Midwifery_Council.html" title="Nursing and Midwifery Council">United Kingdom Central Council of Nursing and Midwifery</a> (UKCC) and were then legally able to practice as a nurse within the United Kingdom.</p>
<p><b>Registered Nurses</b></p>
<p>There are two levels of nurse; 1st level are nurses trained for 3 years (RGN, RMN, RSCN, RN (all branches) whereas 2nd level nurses are the SENs, who train for two years. Formerly, SENs worked under the direction of 1st level nurses, however the distinction is less clear , for example an experienced level 2 nurse taking 'charge' of a ward if the first level nurse is inexperienced.</p>
<p>The SEN training has been phased out, with many SENs retiring, converting to First Level Nurse status or leaving nursing completely.</p>

<p><a name="Project_2000" id="Project_2000"></a></p>
<h4>Project 2000</h4>
<p><b>Student Nurses</b></p>
<p>Under the <a href="/wiki/Thatcher.html" title="Thatcher">Margaret Thatcher</a> government a report by the UKCC was produced to change nurse training in the United Kingdom. Students were to be given supernumerary status and were no longer employed by hospital trusts. Education was moved in to classroom, with colleges and "new" post-1992 universities training nurses. The diploma or degree in nursing is the only way to register as a nurse in the UK. The three [or four] year full-time course is 50/50 theory and practice. Clinical practice is in local hospitals, community health centres etc. Students follow in their first year a "Common Foundation Programme". The next two years are the branch programme, where students learn the skills for their branch; adult, children's, mental health or learning difficulties. At the end of year 3, students can register with the NMC (which replaced the UKCC in 2001) and are legally able to practise as a nurse within the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>The term "Project 2000" in relation to nurses and courses has not been in use for some number of years. In addition, the pre-registration courses offering Diploma of Higher Education (Nursing Studies) are being gradually replaced with BA/BSc courses. In addition, many degree courses that were previously 4 years in length are now 3 years in length.</p>
<p><b>Registered Nurses</b></p>
<p>All nurses that qualify in Britain belong to one of the four branches of nursing: Adult; Children's; Mental Health; Learning Disabilities. All have an RN qualification within their branch and are on the NMC register.</p>

<h3>Legal regulation</h3>
<p>All UK nurses are listed on a <a href="/wiki/Nurse_registry.html" title="Nurse registry">register</a> and are regulated by the <a href="/wiki/Nursing_and_Midwifery_Council.html" title="Nursing and Midwifery Council">Nursing &amp; Midwifery Council</a> (NMC). Nurses need to re-register every year from 1st January 2006 (formerly every three years) and are required to have demonstrated that they have kept up-to-date by undertaking at least 35 hours of <a href="/wiki/Professional_development.html" title="Professional development">professional development</a> within the last 3 years and 750 hours of <a href="/wiki/Nursing_practice.html" title="Nursing practice">nursing practice</a> within 5 years.</p>
<p>There are approximately 673,000 nurses and midwives on the NMC's register, including non-practising nurses and midwives within the UK who have maintained their registration. Approximately 12% of registrants are male and this is increasing. As of August 2005, the NMC register split into three parts, nurses, midwives and specialist community public health nurses. There are 'sub-parts' that the nurse or midwife is registered to practice in, these are:</p>

<h3>Nursing titles</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Healthcare Assistant/Auxiliary Nurse/Nursing Assistant/Clinical Support Worker</b>:- various titles exist to describe staff who, whilst not registered nurses, assist nursing staff. Such workers may provide basic care to the patient, record and monitor <a href="/wiki/Vital_signs.html" title="Vital signs">vital signs</a>, perform medical investigations for example, <a href="/wiki/Venepuncture.html" title="Venepuncture">venepuncture</a> or <a href="/wiki/ECG.html" title="ECG">ECGs</a> and various other nursing tasks. They work under the supervision of a qualified nurse. There is no compulsory training required for these posts, though all NHS trusts must offer courses such as S/NVQ's (Scottish/National Vocational Qualifications) at level two and three which can satisfy the entry requirements for nurse training. Also many employers will insist that the worker attend various training courses such as moving and handling before they can care for patients.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Staff Nurse</b>:- All newly qualified nurses begin at this level and make up the majority of the registered nursing staff. These nurses were previously graded "D" (on the A-I grade system, with A junior), however under <a href="/wiki/Agenda_for_Change.html" title="Agenda for Change">Agenda for Change</a> (AfC), most nurses will be on Band 5.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Senior Staff Nurse</b>:- A senior staff nurse has more clinical experience and management responsibility than a staff nurse. They were employed as 'E' grade nurses under the clinical grading system. Under AfC, again depending on their roles and responsibilites, they will most likely be in Band 5 or 6.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Junior Sister/Junior Charge Nurse/Deputy Ward Manager</b>:- Formerly an "F" grade under clinical grading. These nurses are deputy to the ward manager/charge nurse and as such have more of a managerial role. Banded in either 6 or 7 under Af
