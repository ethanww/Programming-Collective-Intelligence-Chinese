<p><b>Yagan</b> (<a href="/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet.html" title="International Phonetic Alphabet">IPA</a>: <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[ˈjæɪgən]</span>; rhymes with <i>pagan</i>) (c. 1795–<a href="/wiki/July_11.html" title="July 11">11 July</a> <a href="/wiki/1833.html" title="1833">1833</a>) was a <a href="/wiki/Noongar.html" title="Noongar">Noongar</a> warrior who played a key part in early <a href="/wiki/Indigenous_Australians.html" title="Indigenous Australians">indigenous Australian</a> resistance to <a href="/wiki/Europe.html" title="Europe">European</a> settlement and rule in the area of <a href="/wiki/Perth%2C_Western_Australia.html" title="Perth, Western Australia">Perth, Western Australia</a>. After he led a series of attacks in which white settlers were killed, a <a href="/wiki/Bounty_%28reward%29.html" title="Bounty (reward)">bounty</a> was offered for his capture dead or alive, and he was shot dead by a young settler. Yagan's death has passed into <a href="/wiki/Western_Australia.html" title="Western Australia">Western Australian</a> <a href="/wiki/Folklore.html" title="Folklore">folklore</a> as a symbol of the unjust and sometimes brutal treatment of the indigenous peoples of <a href="/wiki/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australia</a> by colonial settlers.</p>
<p>Yagan's head was removed and brought to <a href="/wiki/London.html" title="London">London</a>, where it was exhibited as an "<a href="/wiki/Anthropology.html" title="Anthropology">anthropological</a> curiosity". It spent over a century in storage at a museum before being buried in an unmarked grave in 1964. In 1993 its location was identified, and four years later <a href="/wiki/Exhumation_of_Yagan%27s_head.html" title="Exhumation of Yagan's head">it was exhumed</a> and repatriated to Australia. Since then, the issue of its proper reburial has become a source of great controversy and conflict amongst the indigenous people of the Perth area. To date, the head remains unburied.</p>

<h3>Early life</h3>
<p>A member of the <a href="/wiki/Whadjuk.html" title="Whadjuk">Whadjuk</a> Noongar people, Yagan belonged to a tribe of around 60 people whose name, according to <a href="/wiki/Robert_Lyon_%28Australian_settler%29.html" title="Robert Lyon (Australian settler)">Robert Lyon</a>, was <i><a href="/wiki/Beeliar_%28tribe%29.html" title="Beeliar (tribe)">Beeliar</a></i>. Lyon's information is not entirely reliable, however, and it is now thought that the Beeliar people may have been a family subgroup of a larger tribe that <a href="/wiki/Daisy_Bates_%28Australia%29.html" title="Daisy Bates (Australia)">Daisy Bates</a> called <i>Beelgar</i>.<sup id="_ref-Bourke_1987_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[1]</a></sup> According to Lyon, the Beeliar people occupied the land south of the <a href="/wiki/Swan_River_%28Western_Australia%29.html" title="Swan River (Western Australia)">Swan</a> and <a href="/wiki/Canning_River_%28Western_Australia%29.html" title="Canning River (Western Australia)">Canning</a> Rivers, as far south as <a href="/wiki/Mangles_Bay%2C_Western_Australia.html" title="Mangles Bay, Western Australia">Mangles Bay</a>. It is evident, however, that the group had customary land usage rights over a much larger area than this, extending north as far as <a href="/wiki/Lake_Monger%2C_Western_Australia.html" title="Lake Monger, Western Australia">Lake Monger</a> and north-east to the <a href="/wiki/Helena_River.html" title="Helena River">Helena River</a>. The group also had an unusual degree of freedom to move over their neighbours' land, possibly due to kinship and marriage ties with neighbouring tribes.<sup id="_ref-Hallam_1990_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Yagan is thought to have been born around 1795. His father was <a href="/wiki/Midgegooroo.html" title="Midgegooroo">Midgegooroo</a>, an elder of the Beeliar people; his mother was presumably one of Midgegooroo's two wives. Yagan was probably a <i>Ballaroke</i> in the <a href="/wiki/Noongar_classification.html" title="Noongar classification">Noongar classification</a>. According to Green, he had a wife and two children<sup id="_ref-Green_1981_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[3]</a></sup>, but most other sources state that he was unmarried and childless. Described as taller than average with an impressive burly physique, Yagan had a distinctive tribal tattoo on his right shoulder which identified him as "a man of high degree in tribal law".<sup id="_ref-Green_1981_1" class="reference"><a  title="">[3]</a></sup> He was generally acknowledged to be the most physically powerful of his tribe.<sup id="_ref-Green_1979_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Relations with settlers">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Relations_with_settlers" id="Relations_with_settlers"></a></p>
<h3>Relations with settlers</h3>
<p>Yagan would have been about 35 years old in <a href="/wiki/1829_in_Australia.html" title="1829 in Australia">1829</a> when <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom_of_Great_Britain_and_Ireland.html" title="United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland">British</a> settlers landed in the area and established the <a href="/wiki/Swan_River_Colony.html" title="Swan River Colony">Swan River Colony</a>. For the first two years of the colony, relations between settlers and Noongars were generally amicable, as there was little competition for resources, and the Noongars welcomed the white settlers as <i>Djanga</i>, the returned spirits of the Noongar dead. As time passed, however, conflicts between the two cultures gradually became more frequent. The settlers took the view that the Noongars were nomads with no claim to the land over which they roamed, and so they considered themselves free to fence off land for grazing and farming. As more and more land was fenced off, the Noongars were increasingly denied access to their traditional hunting grounds and sacred sites, so by 1832 Yagan's family group was unable to approach the Swan or Canning Rivers without danger, because <a href="/wiki/Land_grants_in_the_Swan_River_Colony.html" title="Land grants in the Swan River Colony">land grants</a> lined the banks. The Noongars' response to the loss of their hunting and gathering grounds was to take the settlers' crops and spear their <a href="/wiki/Cattle.html" title="Cattle">cattle</a>. They also developed a taste for the settlers' food, and their constant <a href="/wiki/Theft.html" title="Theft">theft</a> of <a href="/wiki/Flour.html" title="Flour">flour</a> and other food supplies became a serious problem for the colony. Another cause of conflict was the Noongar practice of <a href="/wiki/Firestick_farming.html" title="Firestick farming">firestick farming</a>, <a href="/wiki/Bushfire.html" title="Bushfire">firing</a> <a href="/wiki/The_bush.html" title="The bush">the bush</a> to flush out game and encourage germination of undergrowth, which threatened the settlers' crops and houses.<sup id="_ref-Green_1984_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>The first significant Aboriginal resistance to white settlement in Western Australia occurred in December 1831 after Thomas Smedley, a servant of farmer Archibald Butler, ambushed some natives who were raiding a <a href="/wiki/Potato.html" title="Potato">potato</a> patch, and shot dead one of Yagan's family group. A few days later, Yagan, Midgegooroo and others stormed the farmhouse and, finding the door locked, began to break through the mud-brick walls. Inside was another of Butler's servants, Erin Entwhistle, and his two sons Enion and Ralph. After hiding his sons under the bed, Entwhistle opened the door to parley and was instantly speared to death by Yagan and Midgegooroo. Noongar tribal law required that murders be avenged by the killing of a member of the murderer's tribal group, not necessarily the murderer. The spearing of Entwhistle may therefore be understood as retribution under tribal law, as the Noongars would have thought of Butler's household as a family group.<sup id="_ref-Hallam_1990_1" class="reference"><a  title="">[2]</a></sup> The white settlers, however, saw the act as the unprovoked murder of an innocent man.</p>
<p>In June 1832 Yagan led a party of Aborigines in an attack on two labourers who were sowing a field of <a href="/wiki/Wheat.html" title="Wheat">wheat</a> alongside the Canning River near <a href="/wiki/Kelmscott%2C_Western_Australia.html" title="Kelmscott, Western Australia">Kelmscott</a>. One of the men escaped, but the other, William Gaze, was wounded and later died, possibly through infection of the spear wound. In response to this, Yagan was declared an outlaw with a reward of £20 offered for his capture. Yagan managed to avoid capture until early October 1832, when a group of fishermen enticed Yagan and two of his friends into their boat, then pushed off into deep water. The three Noongars were initially taken to the Perth guardhouse, then later transferred to the <a href="/wiki/Round_House.html" title="Round House">Round House</a> at Fremantle. Yagan was sentenced to death, but he was saved by the intercession of a settler named <a href="/wiki/Robert_Lyon_%28Australian_settler%29.html" title="Robert Lyon (Australian settler)">Robert Lyon</a>, who argued that Yagan was defending his land against invasion, and was therefore not a criminal but a <a href="/wiki/Prisoner_of_war.html" title="Prisoner of war">prisoner of war</a>, and was entitled to be treated as such. At the recommendation of <a href="/wiki/John_Septimus_Roe.html" title="John Septimus Roe">John Septimus Roe</a>, Yagan and his friends were instead exiled on <a href="/wiki/Carnac_Island.html" title="Carnac Island">Carnac Island</a> at the <a href="/wiki/Governor_of_Western_Australia.html" title="Governor of Western Australia">Governor's</a> pleasure, under the supervision of Lyon and two soldiers.</p>
<p>Lyon was convinced that he could civilise Yagan and convert him to <a href="/wiki/Christianity.html" title="Christianity">Christianity</a>, and hoped to use his tribal standing to obtain the Noongars' acceptance of white authority. To this end Lyon spent many hours with Yagan learning his language and customs. However, his efforts were cut short when, after a month, Yagan and his companions escaped by stealing an unattended <a href="/wiki/Dinghy.html" title="Dinghy">dinghy</a> and rowing to <a href="/wiki/Woodman_Point%2C_Western_Australia.html" title="Woodman Point, Western Australia">Woodman Point</a> on the mainland. No attempt was made to recapture the men; apparently, the Government considered that they had been sufficiently punished.</p>
<p>In January 1833 two Noongars, Gyallipert and Manyat, visited Perth from <a href="/wiki/King_George_Sound.html" title="King George Sound">King George Sound</a>, where relations between settlers and natives were amicable. Two settlers, Richard Dale and George Smythe, arranged for the men to meet a party of local Noongars in the hope that it might encourage the same friendly relations in the Swan River Colony. On <a href="/wiki/January_26.html" title="January 26">26 January</a> Yagan led a group of ten formally armed Noongars in greeting the two men near Lake Monger. The men exchanged weapons and held a <a href="/wiki/Corroboree.html" title="Corroboree">corroboree</a>, though neither group seemed to understand the language of the other. Yagan and Gyallipert then competed at spear throwing, Yagan striking a walking stick from a distance of 25 metres.</p>
<p>Gyallipert and Manyat remained in Perth for some time, and on <a href="/wiki/March_3.html" title="March 3">3 March</a>, Yagan obtained permission to hold another corroboree, this time in the Post Office garden in Perth. The Perth and King George Sound men met at dusk, chalked their bodies, and performed a number of dances including a <a href="/wiki/Kangaroo.html" title="Kangaroo">kangaroo</a> hunt dance. <i><a href="/wiki/The_West_Australian.html" title="The West Australian">The Perth Gazette</a></i> wrote that Yagan "was master of ceremonies and acquitted himself with infinite grace and dignity".<sup id="_ref-Perth_Gazette_18330316_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>During February and March, Yagan was involved in a series of minor conflicts with settlers. In February settler William Watson complained that Yagan had pushed open his door, demanded a gun, and taken <a href="/wiki/Handkerchief.html" title="Handkerchief">handkerchiefs</a>, and that Watson had had to give him and his companions flour and bread. The following month, he was among a group who received biscuits from a military contingent under Lieutenant Norcott; when Norcott tried to restrict his supply, Yagan threatened him with his spear. Later that month, Yagan was with a group of Noongars that entered Watson's house while he was away. The group left after Watson's wife called on neighbours for help, but were brought back the next day to be lectured about their behaviour by Captain Ellis. The constant conflict prompted <i>The Perth Gazette</i> to remark on "the reckless daring of this desperado who sets his life at a pin's fee ... For the most trivial offence ... he would take the life of any man who provoked him. He is at the head and front of any mischief."<sup id="_ref-Perth_Gazette_18330302_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Wanted dead or alive">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Wanted_dead_or_alive" id="Wanted_dead_or_alive"></a></p>
<h3>Wanted dead or alive</h3>
<p>On the night of <a href="/wiki/April_29.html" title="April 29">29 April</a>, a party of Noongars broke into a Fremantle store to steal flour and were fired upon by the caretaker Peter Chidlow. Domjum, a brother of Yagan, was badly injured and died in jail a few days later. The rest of the party then moved from Fremantle to <a href="/wiki/Preston_Point%2C_Western_Australia.html" title="Preston Point, Western Australia">Preston Point</a>, where Yagan was heard to vow vengeance for the death. Between fifty and sixty Noongars then gathered at <a href="/wiki/Bull_Creek%2C_Western_Australia.html" title="Bull Creek, Western Australia">Bull Creek</a>, within sight of High Road, where they met a party of settlers who were loading carts with provisions. Later that day, the group ambushed the lead cart, spearing to death two white men, Tom and John Velvick. Tribal law only required a single death; the native Munday later explained that both were speared because they had previously mistreated Aboriginal people. The Velvicks had previously been convicted for assaulting Aboriginal people and coloured seamen. Alexandra Hasluck has also argued that a desire to steal the provisions was an important motive in the attack <sup id="_ref-Hasluck_1961_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[8]</a></sup>, but this has been refuted elsewhere <sup id="_ref-Green_1984_1" class="reference"><a  title="">[5]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>For the killing of the Velvicks, the Lieutenant-Governor <a href="/wiki/Frederick_Irwin.html" title="Frederick Irwin">Frederick Irwin</a> declared Yagan, Midgegooroo and Munday outlaws, offering rewards of £20 each for the capture of Midgegooroo and Munday, and a reward of £30 for Yagan's capture dead or alive. Munday successfully appealed against his proscription. Midgegooroo and Yagan must have realised that they would be hunted by settlers, as their group immediately moved from their territory north towards the Helena Valley. Four days after the murder, Midgegooroo was captured on the Helena River, and after a brief, informal trial was <a href="/wiki/Capital_punishment.html" title="Capital punishment">executed</a> by <a href="/wiki/Execution_by_firing_squad.html" title="Execution by firing squad">firing squad</a>. Yagan, however, remained at large for over two months.</p>
<p>Late in May, Yagan was seen by <a href="/wiki/George_Fletcher_Moore.html" title="George Fletcher Moore">George Fletcher Moore</a> on his property in <a href="/wiki/Upper_Swan%2C_Western_Australia.html" title="Upper Swan, Western Australia">Upper Swan</a>, and the two held a conversation in <a href="/wiki/Pidgin.html" title="Pidgin">pidgin</a> <a href="/wiki/English_language.html" title="English language">English</a>. Yagan then spoke in his own language; Moore wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yagan stepped forward and leaning with his left hand on my shoulder while he gesticulated with the right, delivered a sort of recitation, looking earnestly into my face. I regret that I could not understand it. I thought from the tone and manner that the purport was this:-<br />
You came to our country; you have driven us from our haunts, and disturbed us in our occupations. As we walk in our own country we are fired upon by the white men; why should the white men treat us so?<sup id="_ref-Moore_1884_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since Moore had little knowledge of Yagan's native language, Hasluck suggests that this conjecture is probably more indicative of "a feeling of conscience on the part of the white men" than an accurate rendering of Yagan's state of mind.<sup id="_ref-Hasluck_1961_1" class="reference"><a  title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>Yagan then asked Moore whether Midgegooroo was dead or alive. Moore gave no reply, but a servant answered that Midgegooroo was a prisoner on Carnac Island. Yagan responded with a warning: "White man shoot Midgegooroo, Yagan kill three." Moore made no attempt to capture Yagan other than to report the sighting to the nearest magistrate; he wrote, "The truth is, every one wishes him taken, but no one likes to be the captor ... there is something in his daring which one is forced to admire."<sup id="_ref-Moore_1884_1" class="reference"><a  title="">[9]</a></sup></p>

<p>On <a href="/wiki/July_11.html" title="July 11">11 July</a> <a href="/wiki/1833.html" title="1833">1833</a>, two teenage brothers named William and James Keates were herding cattle along the Swan River north of <a href="/wiki/Guildford%2C_Western_Australia.html" title="Guildford, Western Australia">Guildford</a> when a group of Noongars approached on their way to collect their rations of flour from <a href="/wiki/Henry_Bull.html" title="Henry Bull">Henry Bull</a>'s house. Being on friendly terms with Yagan, the Keates brothers suggested he remain with them to avoid arrest. Yagan remained with them all morning, during which time the boys decided to kill Yagan and claim the reward. William Keates tried once to shoot him but the gun stopped at half-cock; no further opportunity arose before they were rejoined by the other natives. When the natives attempted to depart, the Keates took their last opportunity. William Keates shot Yagan, and James shot another native, Heegan, in the act of throwing his spear. Both boys then ran for the river, but William was overtaken and speared to death. James escaped by swimming the river and returned shortly afterwards with a party of armed settlers from Bull's estate.</p>
<p>Moore records that a party of soldiers passed by the area shortly after the incident, and speculates that they must have "frightened the natives (I supposed) or they would have carried off the bodies". When the party of settlers arrived, they found Yagan dead and Heegan dying. Heegan "was groaning and his brains were partly out when the party came, and whether humanity or brutality, a man put a gun to his head and blew it to pieces." Yagan's head was then cut from his body, and his back was skinned to obtain his tribal markings as a trophy. The bodies were buried a short distance from where they had been killed.</p>
<p>James Keates successfully claimed the reward, but his actions were widely criticised; <i>The Perth Gazette</i> referred to Yagan's killing as "a wild and treacherous act ... it is revolting to hear this lauded as a meritorious deed."<sup id="_ref-Perth_Gazette_18330713_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[10]</a></sup> Keates departed the colony the following month; the reasons are unknown, but it is possible that he left from fear of being murdered in retaliation.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>Yagan's head was initially taken to Henry Bull's house. Moore saw it there and sketched the head a number of times in his unpublished, handwritten diary, commenting that "possibly it may yet figure in some museum at home". The head was then preserved by smoking, by hanging it in a hollow tree over a fire of <i><a href="/wiki/Eucalyptus.html" title="Eucalyptus">Eucalyptus</a></i> wood for three months.</p>
<p>In September 1833 Yagan's head was taken to London by Ensign <a href="/wiki/Robert_Dale.html" title="Robert Dale">Robert Dale</a>. According to Paul Turnbull, Dale appears to have persuaded <a href="/wiki/Frederick_Irwin.html" title="Frederick Irwin">Governor Irwin</a> to let him have the head as an "anthropological curiosity" <sup id="_ref-Turnbull_1998_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[11]</a></sup>. After arriving in London, Dale approached a number of <a href="/wiki/Anatomy.html" title="Anatomy">anatomists</a> and <a href="/wiki/Phrenology.html" title="Phrenology">phrenologists</a> attempting to sell the head for £20, claiming that it was worth twice that much. Having failed to find a buyer, he then entered into an arrangement with <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Pettigrew.html" title="Thomas Pettigrew">Thomas Pettigrew</a> for the exclusive use of the head for one year. Pettigrew, a surgeon and antiquarian who was well-known in the London social scene for holding private parties at which he unrolled and <a href="/wiki/Autopsy.html" title="Autopsy">autopsied</a> <a href="/wiki/Ancient_Egypt.html" title="Ancient Egypt">Egyptian</a> <a href="/wiki/Mummy.html" title="Mummy">mummies</a>, displayed the head on a table in front of a panoramic view of King George Sound that was reproduced from Dale's sketches. For effect the head was adorned with a fresh corded headband and feathers of the <a href="/wiki/Red-tailed_Black_Cockatoo.html" title="Red-tailed Black Cockatoo">Red-tailed Black Cockatoo</a>.</p>
<p>Pettigrew also arranged for the head to be examined by a phrenologist. Examination was considered difficult because of the large <a href="/wiki/Bone_fracture.html" title="Bone fracture">fracture</a> across the back of the head caused by the gunshot. The findings, which were predictably consistent with contemporary European opinion of Indigenous Australians<sup id="_ref-Turnbull_1998_1" class="reference"><a  title="">[11]</a></sup>, were published as part of a pamphlet by Dale entitled <i>Descriptive Account of the Panoramic View &amp;c. of King George's Sound and the Adjacent Country</i>,<sup id="_ref-Dale_1834_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[12]</a></sup> which Pettigrew encouraged his guests to buy as a <a href="/wiki/Souvenir.html" title="Souvenir">souvenir</a> of their evening. The frontispiece of the pamphlet was a hand-coloured <a href="/wiki/Aquatint.html" title="Aquatint">aquatint</a> print of Yagan's head by the artist <a href="/wiki/George_Cruikshank.html" title="George Cruikshank">George Cruikshank</a>.</p>
<p>Early in October 1835, both Yagan's head and the panoramic view were returned to Dale, who was then living in <a href="/wiki/Liverpool.html" title="Liverpool">Liverpool</a>. On <a href="/wiki/October_12.html" title="October 12">12 October</a> he presented them to the Liverpool Royal Institution, where the head may have been displayed in a case along with some other preserved heads and wax models illustrating cranial anatomy. In 1894 the Institution's collections were dispersed, and Yagan's head was lent to the <a href="/wiki/Liverpool_Museum.html" title="Liverpool Museum">Liverpool Museum</a>; it is thought not to have been put on display there. By the 1960s Yagan's head was badly deteriorated, and in April 1964 the decision was made to dispose of it. On <a href="/wiki/April_10.html" title="April 10">10 April</a> <a href="/wiki/1964.html" title="1964">1964</a>, Yagan's head was placed in a plywood box, along with a <a href="/wiki/Peru.html" title="Peru">Peruvian</a> mummy and a <a href="/wiki/M%C4%81ori.html" title="Māori">Māori</a> head, and buried in <a href="/wiki/Everton_Cemetery.html" title="Everton Cemetery">Everton Cemetery</a>'s General Section 16, grave number 296. In later years a number of burials were made around the grave, and in 1968 a local hospital buried 20 <a href="/wiki/Stillbirth.html" title="Stillbirth">stillborn</a> babies and two babies who had lived less than twenty-four hours directly over the museum box.</p>

<h3>Lobbying for repatriation</h3>
<p>For many years, at least since the early 1980s, a number of Noongar groups sought the return of Yagan's head.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is Aboriginal belief that because Yagan's skeletal remains are incomplete, his spirit is earthbound. The uniting of his head and torso will immediately set his spirit free to continue its eternal journey.<sup id="_ref-Colbung_1996_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[13]</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was unknown at that time, however, what had happened to the head after it left Pettigrew's possession. In the early 1980s, <a href="/wiki/Ken_Colbung.html" title="Ken Colbung">Ken Colbung</a> was entrusted with the search for the head by tribal elders. In 1985 he engaged Lily Bhavna Kauler as a researcher, and a number of unsuccessful enquiries were made to various United Kingdom museums. In the early 1990s, Colbung enlisted the aid of <a href="/wiki/University_of_London.html" title="University of London">University of London</a> <a href="/wiki/Archaeology.html" title="Archaeology">archaeologist</a> <a href="/wiki/Peter_Ucko.html" title="Peter Ucko">Peter Ucko</a>. One of Ucko's researchers, Cressida Fforde, was funded by the <a href="/wiki/Government_of_Australia.html" title="Government of Australia">Government of Australia</a> to conduct a literature search for information on the head. She successfully traced the head in December 1993, and in April the following year, Colbung applied for permission to exhume it under Section 25 of the <a href="/wiki/Burial_Act_1857.html" title="Burial Act 1857">Burial Act 1857</a>. <a href="/wiki/Home_Office.html" title="Home Office">Home Office</a> regulations required <a href="/wiki/Next_of_kin.html" title="Next of kin">next of kin</a> consent for the remains of the 22 babies to be disturbed, but Colbung's <a href="/wiki/Solicitor.html" title="Solicitor">solicitors</a> requested that this condition be waived on grounds that the exhumation would be of great personal significance to Yagan's living relatives, and great national importance to Australia.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, divisions in the Perth Noongar community began to show, with Colbung's role in the repatriation questioned by a number of elders, and one Noongar registering a complaint with the <a href="/wiki/Liverpool_City_Council.html" title="Liverpool City Council">Liverpool City Council</a> over Colbung's involvement. There was much acrimonious debate within the Noongar community about who had the best cultural qualifications to take possession of the head, some of which was publicly aired. On <a href="/wiki/July_25.html" title="July 25">25 July</a> a public meeting was held in Perth, where all parties agreed to put aside their differences and co-operate to ensure that the repatriation was a "national success". A Yagan Steering Committee was established to co-ordinate the repatriation, and Colbung's application was allowed to proceed.</p>
<p>In January 1995 the Home Office advised Colbung that it was unable to waive the necessity of obtaining next of kin consent for the exhumation. It then contacted the five relatives whose addresses were known, receiving unconditional consent from only one. Accordingly, on <a href="/wiki/June_30.html" title="June 30">30 June</a> <a href="/wiki/1995.html" title="1995">1995</a>, Colbung and the other interested parties were advised that the application for exhumation had been rejected.<sup id="_ref-Fforde_2002_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[14]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Yagan Steering Committee then met on <a href="/wiki/September_21.html" title="September 21">21 September</a> and decided to proceed by lobbying Australian and British politicians for support. This approach led to an invitation for Colbung to visit the United Kingdom at the British government's expense. Colbung arrived in the United Kingdom on <a href="/wiki/May_20.html" title="May 20">20 May</a> <a href="/wiki/1997.html" title="1997">1997</a>. His visit attracted substantial media coverage and increased the political pressure on the British Government.

<p>While Colbung was in the United Kingdom, Martin and Richard Bates were engaged to undertake a <a href="/wiki/Geophysics.html" title="Geophysics">geophysical</a> survey of the grave site. Using <a href="/wiki/Electromagnetism.html" title="Electromagnetism">electromagnetic</a> and <a href="/wiki/Ground_penetrating_radar.html" title="Ground penetrating radar">ground penetrating radar</a> techniques, they identified an approximate position of the box that suggested it could be accessed from the side via the adjacent plot. A report of the survey was passed to the Home Office, prompting further discussions between the British and Australian Governments.<sup id="_ref-Bates_2005_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[15]</a></sup></p>
<p>Of concern to the Home Office were an undisclosed number of letters that it had received objecting to Colbung's involvement in the repatriation process; it therefore sought assurances from the Australian Government that Colbung was a correct applicant. In response Colbung asked his elders to ask the <a href="/wiki/Aboriginal_and_Torres_Strait_Islander_Commission.html" title="Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission">Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission</a> (ATSIC) to tell the British Home Office that he was the correct applicant. ATSIC then convened a meeting in Perth at which it was again resolved that Colbung's application could proceed.</p>
<p>Colbung continued to press for the exhumation, asking that it be performed before the 164th anniversary of Yagan's death on <a href="/wiki/July_11.html" title="July 11">11 July</a>, so that the anniversary could be the occasion of a celebration. His request was not met, and on the anniversary of Yagan's death, Colbung conducted a short memorial service at the burial plot in Everton. He returned to Australia empty-handed on <a href="/wiki/July_15.html" title="July 15">15 July</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Exhumation_of_Yagan%27s_head.html" title="Exhumation of Yagan's head">exhumation of Yagan's head</a> eventually proceeded, without Colbung's knowledge, by excavating six feet down the side of the grave, then tunnelling horizontally to the location of the box. Thus the exhumation was performed without disturbing any other remains. The following day, a <a href="/wiki/Forensics.html" title="Forensics">forensic</a> <a href="/wiki/Palaeontology.html" title="Palaeontology">palaeontologist</a> from the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Bradford.html" title="University of Bradford">University of Bradford</a> positively identified the <a href="/wiki/Skull.html" title="Skull">skull</a> as Yagan's by correlating the fractures with those described in Pettigrew's report.<sup id="_ref-Bates_2005_1" class="reference"><a  title="">[15]</a></sup> The skull was then kept at the museum until <a href="/wiki/August_29.html" title="August 29">29 August</a>, when it was handed over to the Liverpool City Council.</p>

<h3>Repatriation</h3>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/August_27.html" title="August 27">27 August</a> <a href="/wiki/1997.html" title="1997">1997</a>, a delegation of Noongars consisting of Ken Colbung, <a href="/wiki/Robert_Bropho.html" title="Robert Bropho">Robert Bropho</a>, Richard Wilkes and Mingli Wanjurri-Nungala arrived in the UK to collect Yagan's head. The delegation was to have been larger, but Commonwealth funding was withdrawn at the last minute. The handover of Yagan's skull was further delayed, however, when a Noongar named Corrie Bodney applied to the <a href="/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_Western_Australia.html" title="Supreme Court of Western Australia">Supreme Court of Western Australia</a> for an injunction against the handover. Claiming that his family group has sole responsibility for Yagan's remains, Bodney declared the exhumation illegal and denied the existence of any tradition or belief necessitating the head's exhumation and removal to Australia. Another Noongar, Albert Corunna, then came forward with a claim to be Yagan's closest living relative. The Supreme Court had no power to grant an emergency injunction binding the <a href="/wiki/Her_Majesty%27s_Government.html" title="Her Majesty's Government">Government of the United Kingdom</a>, so instead it asked the <a href="/wiki/Government_of_Western_Australia.html" title="Government of Western Australia">Government of Western Australia</a> to object formally to the handing over of Yagan's remains. The United Kingdom Government responded favourably to the objection, agreeing to withhold the head until the injunction application had been considered. On <a href="/wiki/August_29.html" title="August 29">29 August</a> the court rejected the injunction application, on the grounds that Bodney had previously agreed to the current arrangements, and on the evidence of another Noongar elder and an anthropologist, both of whom refuted Bodney's claim to sole responsibility.<sup id="_ref-Fforde_2002_1" class="reference"><a  title="">[14]</a></sup></p>
<p>Yagan's skull was handed over to the Noongar delegation at a ceremony at the <a href="/wiki/Liverpool_Town_Hall.html" title="Liverpool Town Hall">Liverpool Town Hall</a> on <a href="/wiki/August_31.html" title="August 31">31 August</a> <a href="/wiki/1997.html" title="1997">1997</a>. In accepting the skull, Colbung made comments that allegedly linked Yagan's death with the death of <a href="/wiki/Diana%2C_Princess_of_Wales.html" title="Diana, Princess of Wales">Princess Diana</a>, who had died that day:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Because the Poms did the wrong thing they have to suffer. They have to learn too, to live with it as we did and that is how nature goes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Colbung's comments prompted a media furore throughout Australia, with newspapers receiving many letters from the public expressing shock and anger at the comments. Colbung later claimed that his comments had been misinterpreted.</p>
<p>On its return to Perth, Yagan's head continued to be a source of controversy and conflict. Responsibility for reburial of the head was given to a "Committee for the Reburial of Yagan's Kaat", headed by Richard Wilkes. However the reburial was delayed by disputes between elders over the burial location, mainly due to uncertainty of the whereabouts of the rest of his body, and disagreement about the importance of burying the head with the body.</p>
<p>A number of attempts were made to locate the remains of Yagan's body, which are believed to be on a property on West Swan Road in the outer Perth suburb of <a href="/wiki/Belhus%2C_Western_Australia.html" title="Belhus, Western Australia">Belhus</a>. A <a href="/wiki/Remote_sensing.html" title="Remote sensing">remote sensing</a> survey of the site was carried out in 1998, but no remains were found. An archaeological survey of the area was undertaken two years later, but this also was unsuccessful.<sup id="_ref-Fforde_2002_2" class="reference"><a  title="">[14]</a></sup> Disputes then arose over whether the head could be buried separately from the body. Wilkes has claimed that it can, so long as it is placed where Yagan was killed, so that <a href="/wiki/Dreamtime_%28mythology%29.html" title="Dreamtime (mythology)">Dreamtime</a> spirits can reunite the remains.<sup id="_ref-Lampathakis_2005_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[16]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 1998 the Western Australian Planning Commission and the Department of Aboriginal Affairs jointly published a document entitled <i>Yagan's Gravesite Master Plan</i>, which discussed "matters of ownership, management, development and future use" of the property on which Yagan's remains are believed to be buried. Under consideration was the possibility of turning the site into an indigenous burial site, to be managed by the Metropolitan Cemeteries Board.</p>
<p>To date, Yagan's head remains unburied. It spent some time in storage in a bank vault, before being handed over to forensics experts who reconstructed a model from it. Since then it has been in storage at Western Australia's state <a href="/wiki/Morgue.html" title="Morgue">mortuary</a>. Plans to re-bury the head have been deferred or delayed numerous times, and this has caused ongoing conflict between Noongar groups. The reburial committee have been accused of acting against the wishes of the Noongar community, by deferring its burial in the hope of making money out of it with elaborate parks and monuments. Richard Wilkes, however, says that the committee has direct kinship lines to Yagan, and wants the head to be buried properly, but has been delayed by searches and burial site negotiations. Alternative proposals have been put forward: for example, early in 2006 Ken Colbung called for the head to be <a href="/wiki/Cremation.html" title="Cremation">cremated</a> and the ashes scattered on the Swan River.<sup id="_ref-NIT_2006_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[17]</a></sup> In June 2006, Wilkes stated that the head would be buried by July 2007.<sup id="_ref-Philip_2006_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[18]</a></sup></p>

Colbung claims "Court was more interested in spending tax payers' money on refurbishing the badly neglected burial place of <a href="/wiki/James_Stirling_%28Australian_governor%29.html" title="James Stirling (Australian governor)">Captain James Stirling</a>, WA's first governor."<sup id="_ref-Colbung_1996_1" class="reference"><a  title="">[13]</a></sup> Despite this setback, the Noongar community persisted, establishing a Yagan Committee and running a number of fund-raising drives. Eventually, sufficient funds were collected to allow the commissioning of Australian sculptor Robert Hitchcock to create a statue. The result was a life-size statue in <a href="/wiki/Bronze.html" title="Bronze">bronze</a>, depicting Yagan standing naked with a spear held across his shoulders. Hitchcock's statue of Yagan was officially opened by Yagan Committee chairperson Elizabeth Hanson on <a href="/wiki/September_11.html" title="September 11">11 September</a> <a href="/wiki/1984.html" title="1984">1984</a>. It stands on <a href="/wiki/Heirisson_Island.html" title="Heirisson Island">Heirisson Island</a> in the Swan River near Perth.</p>
<p>In 1997, within a week of the return of Yagan's head to Perth, vandals beheaded the statue and stole the head. After restoration of the statue, it was beheaded for a second time. Since receiving a second restoration, it has been left unharmed. To date, the <a href="/wiki/Western_Australia_Police.html" title="Western Australia Police">Western Australia Police</a> have not succeeded in identifying the vandals or recovering the bronze heads, although credit for the act was anonymously claimed by a "British loyalist" as an act of retaliation for Colbung's comments about Princess Diana.</p>

<p>In 2002 <a href="/wiki/Member_of_the_Western_Australian_Legislative_Assembly.html" title="Member of the Western Australian Legislative Assembly">Member of the Western Australian Legislative Assembly</a> <a href="/wiki/Janet_Woollard.html" title="Janet Woollard">Janet Woollard</a> called for the statue's <a href="/wiki/Intimate_part.html" title="Intimate part">private parts</a> to be covered up, but nothing was done. In November 2005 Richard Wilkes again called for the statue's private parts to be covered, on the grounds that such a depiction would be more historically accurate as Yagan would have worn a covering for most of the year. Also under consideration is the creation of a new statue with a head shape that accords better with the forensic reconstruction of Yagan's head.<sup id="_ref-Kent_2005_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[22]</a></sup></p>

<h3>Literature and film</h3>
<p><a href="/wiki/Mary_Durack.html" title="Mary Durack">Mary Durack</a> published a fictionalised account of Yagan's life in her 1964 children's novel <i>The Courteous Savage: Yagan of the Swan River</i>.<sup id="_ref-Durack_1964_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[23]</a></sup> When reissued in 1976, it was renamed <i>Yagan of the Bibbulmun</i><sup id="_ref-Durack_1976_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[24]</a></sup> because the word "Savage" was by then considered <a href="/wiki/Racism.html" title="Racism">racist</a>.</p>
<p>The repeated beheading of Yagan's statue in 1997 prompted indigenous writer <a href="/wiki/Archie_Weller.html" title="Archie Weller">Archie Weller</a> to write a short story entitled <i>Confessions of a Headhunter</i>. Weller later worked with film director Sally Riley to adapt the story into a script<sup id="_ref-Riley_1999_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[25]</a></sup>, and in 2000 a 35 minute movie, also named <i>Confessions of a Headhunter</i>, was released<sup id="_ref-AFC_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[26]</a></sup>. Directed by Sally Riley, the movie won Best Short Fiction Film at the 2000 <a href="/wiki/Australian_Film_Institute_Awards.html" title="Australian Film Institute Awards">AFI Awards</a>. The following year the script won the Script Award in the 2001 <a href="/wiki/Western_Australian_Premier%27s_Book_Awards.html" title="Western Australian Premier's Book Awards">Western Australian Premier's Book Awards</a>.</p>

<h3>Other cultural references</h3>
<p>In September 1989 an early maturing cultivar of <a href="/wiki/Barley.html" title="Barley">barley</a>, bred by the Western Australian Department of Agriculture for performance on sandy soils, was released under the name "<i>Hordeum vulgare</i> (Barley) c.v. Yagan" <sup id="_ref-Portman_1989_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[28]</a></sup>. Commonly referred to simply as "Yagan", the cultivar is named for Yagan, continuing a tradition of labeling Western Australian grain cultivars after historic people of Western Australia.</p>
