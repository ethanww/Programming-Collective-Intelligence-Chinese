<p><a name="Software_patents_vs_copyright" id="Software_patents_vs_copyright"></a></p>
<h2>Software patents vs copyright</h2>
<p>Software patents are sometimes confused with <a href="/wiki/Software_copyright.html" title="Software copyright">software copyright</a>. Under international agreements, such as the <a href="/wiki/World_Trade_Organization.html" title="World Trade Organization">WTO</a>'s <a href="/wiki/TRIPs_Agreement.html" title="TRIPs Agreement">TRIPs Agreement</a>, any software written is automatically covered by copyright. This allows the copyright owner to prevent another entity from directly copying the source code. There is no need to register code in order to get copyright protection. If an author does register source code, however, they may collect <a href="/wiki/Punitive_damages.html" title="Punitive damages">punitive damages</a> if their code is copied without a <a href="/wiki/License.html" title="License">license</a>. Copyrights may be enforceable for up to 90 years.</p>
<p>Copyleft (that include several <a href="/wiki/Open_source.html" title="Open source">open source</a> and free software licences) license agreements are examples of how copyrights are used to encourage the public disclosure of improved versions of a particular piece of software. The license agreements prevent third parties from copying a given piece of source code unless said third parties agree to make their improvements to the source code available to the public under similar open source terms when they distribute the program.</p>
<p>Patents, on the other hand, give their owners the right to prevent others from copying a claimed invention. A software patent claim is a one sentence definition of a method or system for performing a given computer implemented invention.</p>
<p>Patents are not granted automatically. Inventors must file <a href="/wiki/Patent_application.html" title="Patent application">patent applications</a> in each and every country (such as Japan, China, US or India) or region (such at the European Patent Office) that they want protection in. These patent applications must disclose how to make and use the invention in sufficient detail so that another person of ordinary skill in the art can reproduce the invention without undue experimentation. If it is not self evident, then a patent application must also disclose what practical utility an invention has. Patent applications also have one or more claims which set out the boundaries of the invention that the inventor asserts is his/her original and non-obvious invention.</p>
<p>Most, but not all, countries or regions then assign one of their <a href="/wiki/Patent_examiner.html" title="Patent examiner">patent examiners</a> to the case to determine if the inventor is entitled to the patent claims they are requesting. If so, then the claims are allowed and, upon payment of a fee, a patent issues.</p>
<p>Different countries have different standards for allowing patents. This is particularly true of computer implemented inventions. Thus a particular computer based invention may be patentable in one country, such as the US, but not patentable in another country, such as the member states of the European Union.</p>
<p>Once a patent issues in a given country, the patent owner can prevent others from making, using or selling the claimed invention in that country. Patents are generally enforceable for up to 20 years.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Unisys.html" title="Unisys">Unisys</a> US LZW patent <a  class="external text" title="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?patentnumber=4,558,302">U.S. Patent 4,558,302</a> is an example of a software patent. It covers the <a href="/wiki/GIF.html" title="GIF">GIF</a> method for data compression. This patent expired on June 20, 2003 and thus Unisys can no longer prevent third parties from practicing the claimed invention in the US.</p>
<p>Patents and copyrights form complementary means for protecting software innovations. Patents cover the underlying methodologies embodied in a given piece of software, independent of the particular language or code that the software is written in. Copyrights protect against the direct copying of some or all of a particular version of a given piece of software, but do not prevent other authors from writing their own embodiments of the underlying methodologies. Copyrights can also be used to protect a given proprietary set of data from being copied while still allowing the author to keep the contents of said set of data a <a href="/wiki/Trade_secret.html" title="Trade secret">trade secret</a>.</p>

Growth of Software Patents in US</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The first software patent ever granted is probably a patent for a "computer having slow and quick access storage, when programmed to solve a linear programming problem by an iterative algorithm, the iterative algorithm being such that (...)" applied for in <a href="/wiki/1962.html" title="1962">1962</a> by <a href="/wiki/BP.html" title="BP">British Petroleum Company</a> (<a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cippm.org.uk/pdfs/JILT%20kretschmer%2011_03.pdf">[2]</a>, see end of page 3). The patent relates to solving simultaneous <a href="/wiki/Linear_equation.html" title="Linear equation">linear equations</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/United_States_Patent_and_Trademark_Office.html" title="United States Patent and Trademark Office">USPTO</a> has traditionally not considered software to be patentable because by statute patents can only be granted to "processes, machines, articles of manufacture, and compositions of matter". In particular patents cannot be granted to "scientific truths" or "mathematical expressions" of them. This means that most of the fundamental techniques of software engineering have never been patented.</p>
<p>The USPTO maintained this position, that software was in effect a mathematical algorithm, and therefore not patentable into the 1980's. The position of the USPTO was challenged with a landmark 1981 <a href="/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States.html" title="Supreme Court of the United States">Supreme Court</a> case, <a href="/wiki/Diamond_v._Diehr.html" title="Diamond v. Diehr">Diamond v. Diehr</a>. The case involved a device that used computer software to ensure the correct timing when heating, or curing, rubber. Although the software was the integral part of the device, it also had other functions that related to real world manipulation. The court then ruled that as a device to mold rubber, it was a patentable object. The court essentially ruled that while algorithms themselves could not be patented, devices that utilized them could. This ruling wasn't as straightforward as many would have liked, forcing many electronic device makers into the courts to establish that their inventions were in fact patentable. <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bitlaw.com/software-patent/history.html">[3]</a></p>
<p>Due to different treatment of federal patent rights in different parts of the country, in <a href="/wiki/1982.html" title="1982">1982</a> the U.S. Congress created a new court (the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Court_of_Appeals_for_the_Federal_Circuit.html" title="United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit">Federal Circuit</a>) to hear patent cases. The new circuit rejected rulings from some parts of the country, and nationalized others. For example, the court made patents generally easier to uphold by presuming patents were valid unless proven invalid and weakening the defence of <a href="/wiki/Inventive_step_and_non-obviousness.html" title="Inventive step and non-obviousness">non-obviousness</a>. This court allowed issues, such as patentability of software, to be treated uniformly throughout the US. Due to a few landmark cases in this court, by the early <a href="/wiki/1990s.html" title="1990s">1990s</a> the patentability of software was well established, and in 1996 the USPTO issued <a  class="external text" title="http://www.bitlaw.com/source/soft_pats/final.html">Final Computer Related Examination Guidelines</a>. See <a href="/wiki/Software_patents_under_United_States_patent_law.html" title="Software patents under United States patent law">Software patents under United States patent law</a>.</p>
<p>In Europe, the <a href="/wiki/European_Patent_Organisation.html" title="European Patent Organisation">EPO</a> and other national patent offices have issued many granted patents for inventions involving software since the <a href="/wiki/European_Patent_Convention.html" title="European Patent Convention">European Patent Convention</a> (EPC) came into force in the late 1970s. Article 52 of the <a href="/wiki/European_Patent_Convention.html" title="European Patent Convention">EPC</a> excludes "programs for computers" from patentability (Art. 52(2)) to the extent that a patent application relates to a computer program "as such" (Art. 52(3)). This has been interpreted to mean that any invention which makes a non-obvious "technical contribution" or solves a "technical problem" in a non-obvious way is patentable even if a computer program is used in the invention. See <a href="/wiki/Software_patents_under_the_European_Patent_Convention.html" title="Software patents under the European Patent Convention">Software patents under the European Patent Convention</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/India.html" title="India">India</a>, a clause to include software patents was quashed by the <a href="/wiki/Indian_Parliament.html" title="Indian Parliament">Indian Parliament</a> in <a href="/wiki/April_2005.html" title="April 2005">April 2005</a>.</p>
<p>The recent expansion of the <a href="/wiki/Internet.html" title="Internet">Internet</a> and <a href="/wiki/E-commerce.html" title="E-commerce">e-commerce</a> has led to many patents being applied for and being granted for business methods implemented in software. There have been several successful enforcement trials in the USA. In Europe, in contrast, computer-implemented inventions which <i>only</i> solve a business problem using a computer, rather than a technical problem, are considered unpatentable as lacking an inventive step (see <a href="/wiki/T_258/03.html" title="T 258/03">T 258/03</a>). Nevertheless, the fact that an invention is useful in business does not mean it is not patentable if it also solves a technical problem. This fine line has led the EPO to reject <a href="/wiki/Amazon.com#Patent_controversies.html" title="Amazon.com">Amazon's 1-click patent</a>, but to grant related patent number EP0927945 claiming a method of obtaining a mailing address for sending a gift. This patent is currently being <a href="/wiki/Opposition_procedure_before_the_European_Patent_Office.html" title="Opposition procedure before the European Patent Office">opposed</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australia</a>, pure or abstract methods of doing business are not considered to be patentable, but if the method is implemented using a computer, it avoids the exclusion for business methods <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.aipla.org/html/Patent-Handbook/countries/australia/AUsoftware.html">[4]</a>.</p>

<h3>Jurisdictions</h3>
<p>Substantive <a href="/wiki/Law.html" title="Law">law</a> regarding the patentability of software and computer-implemented inventions, and <a href="/wiki/Case_law.html" title="Case law">case law</a> interpreting the legal provisions, are different under different jurisdictions.</p>
<p>The national jurisdictions relating to software patents in <a href="/wiki/Europe.html" title="Europe">Europe</a> and in the <a href="/wiki/European_Union.html" title="European Union">European Union</a> are not harmonized even though some harmonization has been brought into the national jurisdictions in the 1970s and 1980s. Interpretation of the substantive law varies to some extent from state to state. In <a href="/wiki/2002.html" title="2002">2002</a>, in order to harmonize the national laws a step further, the <a href="/wiki/EU_Commission.html" title="EU Commission">EU Commission</a> proposed a <a href="/wiki/Directive_on_the_patentability_of_computer-implemented_inventions.html" title="Directive on the patentability of computer-implemented inventions">Directive on the patentability of computer-implemented inventions</a>, but setting the exact terms of the Directive has been difficult. In <a href="/wiki/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a>, the <a href="/wiki/European_Parliament.html" title="European Parliament">European Parliament</a> deeply amended the original draft from the Commission. Two years later, the <a href="/wiki/Council_of_the_European_Union.html" title="Council of the European Union">Council of the European Union</a> (i.e. national government ministers) mostly reinstated the original text, but the text was eventually rejected by the Parliament on July 6, 2005. The proposed directive will not become law.</p>

<p><a name="Scope_of_software_patentability" id="Scope_of_software_patentability"></a></p>
<h3>Scope of software patentability</h3>
<p>As noted above both the EU and the US have traditionally restricted the ability to patent software. This has led to several proposals for some very narrow definitions of what software actually is. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>A piece of code not relating to "the use of controllable forces of nature to achieve predictable results". <span class="reference"><sup id="fn_1_back"><a  title="">1</a></sup></span></li>
<li>A piece of code relating solely to the "processing, handling and presentation of information". <span class="reference"><sup id="fn_2_back"><a  title="">2</a></sup></span></li>
<li>A piece of code with no "technical effect" (depending in turn on how one chooses to define "technical"). <span class="reference"><sup id="fn_3_back"><a  title="">3</a></sup></span></li>
<li>A piece of code as an abstract listing, not actually running on a programmable device. <span class="reference"><sup id="fn_4_back"><a  title="">4</a></sup></span></li>
<li>A piece of code with merely literary merit, rather than any identifiable functional benefits. <span class="reference"><sup id="fn_5_back"><a  title="">5</a></sup></span></li>
</ul>
<p><a  class="new" title="Ben Klemens">Ben Klemens</a>, a Guest Scholar at the <a href="/wiki/Brookings_Institution.html" title="Brookings Institution">Brookings Institution</a>, proposes that patents should be granted only to inventions that include a physical component that is by itself nonobvious. <span class="reference"><sup id="fn_6_back"><a  title="">6</a></sup></span> This is based on Justice <a href="/wiki/William_Rhenquist.html" title="William Rhenquist">William Rhenquist</a>'s ruling in the U.S. Supreme Court case of <a href="/wiki/Diamond_v._Diehr.html" title="Diamond v. Diehr">Diamond v. Diehr</a> that stated that "... insignificant postsolution activity will not transform an unpatentable principle into a patentable process." By this rule, one would consider software loaded onto a stock PC to be an abstract algorithm with obvious postsolution activity, while a new circuit design implementing the logic would likely be a nonobvious physical device. Upholding an "insignificant postsolution activity" rule as per Justice <a href="/wiki/Rhenquist.html" title="Rhenquist">Rhenquist</a>'s ruling would also eliminate most <a href="/wiki/Business_method_patents.html" title="Business method patents">business method patents</a>.</p>
<p>A further difficulty in drawing a clear boundary between software patents and other patents may come from the fact that a <a href="/wiki/Claim_%28patent%29.html" title="Claim (patent)">patent claim</a> can be written so as to embrace many different implementations (some using purely mechanical or electrical means, others using software), for instance by using functional features under certain jurisdictions (for example, "means for controlling"). The expression "computer-implement<b>able</b> inventions" has been coined to refer to this reality.</p>
<p>Additionally, under the so-called <a href="/wiki/Doctrine_of_equivalents.html" title="Doctrine of equivalents">doctrine of equivalents</a> and its analogues, a patent that on its face does not appear to require software can be infringed in certain circumstances if software is used as an equivalent of (that is, a substitute for) a non-software element, making it even more difficult to draw the boundary. However, no U.S. court has yet ruled that a physical device violates a software patent via the doctrine of equivalents or vice versa.</p>

<p><a name="Software_patents_specifics" id="Software_patents_specifics"></a></p>
<h4>Software patents specifics</h4>
<p>Apart from generally accepted and well known advantages of the ordinary patents, software patents have several specific features, creating unwanted effects (<a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.dit.upm.es/~joaquin/report_en.pdf">[5]</a>). The patent supporters suggest various methods to minimize such effects.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Patents against compatibility">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Patents_against_compatibility" id="Patents_against_compatibility"></a></p>
<h5>Patents against compatibility</h5>
<p>Patenting data exchange standards frequently forces another programming group to introduce an alternative format. For instance, the <a href="/wiki/PNG.html" title="PNG">PNG</a> format was introduced to avoid the <a href="/wiki/GIF.html" title="GIF">GIF</a> patent problems, or the <a href="/wiki/Ogg.html" title="Ogg">Ogg</a> <a href="/wiki/Vorbis.html" title="Vorbis">Vorbis</a> format was introduced to avoid the <a href="/wiki/MP3.html" title="MP3">MP3</a> patent problems. If this new suggested format is patented again, the final result may be a large number of incompatible formats. Creating such formats and supporting them costs money, creates inconvenience to users and even threatens to split the Internet into several partially incompatible sub-networks (<a href="/wiki/Advanced_Systems_Format.html" title="Advanced Systems Format">ASF</a> and non-<a href="/wiki/Advanced_Systems_Format.html" title="Advanced Systems Format">ASF</a>, for instance).</p>

<p>Some large companies (<a href="/wiki/Oracle_Corporation.html" title="Oracle Corporation">Oracle Corporation</a>, <a href="/wiki/Red_Hat.html" title="Red Hat">Red Hat</a>) have clearly said that they do not need software patents to prevent others from using their ideas (the main purpose of the patent), but must accumulate such patents with the purpose of defense against possible attacks. This means that such companies are forced to buy the work of the patent management institution, rather than investing that money into software improvement.</p>
<p>Taking these and other effects into consideration, the <a href="/wiki/European_Parliament.html" title="European Parliament">EU Parliament</a> rejected the proposed Software Patent Directive in July <a href="/wiki/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a> with the vast majority of votes.</p>
<p>On the other hand, this argument is rather beside the point. Once a de facto standard is established, the company that controls that standard has a legal monopoly that can be even more impenetrable than one protected by patent. See the various court decisions in the Microsoft antitrust case. Thus, Microsoft and Oracle need very little patent protection, but their competitors are crucially dependent on patents to protect against predation by larger competitors.</p>

<h3>Computer-implemented invention</h3>
<p>The term "computer-implemented invention" was put forward by the <a href="/wiki/European_Commission.html" title="European Commission">European Commission</a>, based on an expression used by the European Patent Office <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.european-patent-office.org/legal/gui_lines/e/c_iv_2_3_6.htm">[6]</a>, and proposed as "any invention the performance of which involves the use of a <a href="/wiki/Computer.html" title="Computer">computer</a>, <a href="/wiki/Computer_network.html" title="Computer network">computer network</a> or other programmable apparatus and having one or more <i><a href="/wiki/Prima_facie.html" title="Prima facie">prima facie</a></i> <a href="/wiki/Novelty_%28patent%29.html" title="Novelty (patent)">novel</a> features which are realised wholly or partly by means of a computer or <a href="/wiki/Computer_program.html" title="Computer program">computer programs</a>." <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://europa.eu.int/comm/internal_market/en/indprop/comp/com02-92en.pdf">[7]</a> The term has been criticized as a politically motived obfuscation manoeuver <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://elis.ugent.be/~jmaebe/swpat/cii.html">[8]</a>. However, it is a more wide-ranging term than "software patent" that takes into account some of the arguments used by various applicants for "computer-implemented inventions" who have tried to get them granted by the European Patent Office.</p>
<p>The European Patent Convention states that programs for computers as such are excluded. Various applicants have tried to argue that the words "as such" mean that they can avoid the exclusion by implementing or by claiming their invention as an object or in terms of hardware, such as a computer program stored on a disk or in a ROM, or as a computer programmed in a specific way. However, the case law of the European Patent Office <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://legal.european-patent-office.org/dg3/biblio/t880158ep1.htm">[9]</a> and various national courts in Europe <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Patents/2005/1589.html#para24">[10]</a> clearly states that a computer program as such cannot be patented in the guise of an object or, in other words, that using a technical means (e.g a visual display unit) to carry out a process is not alone sufficient to render patentable a process which in essence constitutes a computer program as such.</p>
<p>At first glance, the phrase "software patent" implies that the claimed invention must be implemented in software to be caught by the exclusion. In contrast, the phrase "computer-implemented invention" is a more legally accurate term which avoids the potentially incorrect assumption that the computer program exclusion can be avoided if you are not using software.</p>

<h3>Litigation</h3>
<p>Several successful litigations show that software patents are enforceable in the USA. For example, Eolas was awarded $565 million from Microsoft. See <a href="/wiki/List_of_software_patents.html" title="List of software patents">List of software patents</a> for more examples.</p>
<p>So far there does not appear to have been any case before a European Court where infringement of a software patent has been proved and damages have been awarded. However, there have been a few court cases where the validity or not of a patent involving software has been the question, where in some European countries a national court has ruled either that a particular patent is valid (eg Germany); or that other patents involving software could be (eg UK). See <a href="/wiki/Software_patents_under_the_European_Patent_Convention.html" title="Software patents under the European Patent Convention">Software patents under the European Patent Convention</a> for details.</p>

Total US software patents by class of invention as of 2004</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Patenting software is widespread in the US. As of 2004, approximately 145,000 patents had issued in the 22 classes of patents covering computer implemented inventions. (see table to the right). About 17,000 new patents are issued each year.</p>
<p>A large fraction of these patents are assigned to major companies. <a href="/wiki/Microsoft.html" title="Microsoft">Microsoft</a>, for example, had about 5000 patents issued to it as of <a href="/wiki/April_2006.html" title="April 2006">April 2006</a>. <a href="/wiki/IBM.html" title="IBM">IBM</a> has over 3,000 patents issued to it every year, although a significant fraction of these are unrelated to software.</p>
<p>Many software companies <a href="/wiki/Cross-licensing.html" title="Cross-licensing">cross license</a> their patents to each other. These agreements allow each party to practice the other party's patented inventions without the threat of being sued for <a href="/wiki/Patent_infringement.html" title="Patent infringement">patent infringement</a>. Often, there is no payment of any royalties between the parties. <a href="/wiki/Microsoft.html" title="Microsoft">Microsoft</a>, for example, has agreements with <a href="/wiki/IBM.html" title="IBM">IBM</a>, <a href="/wiki/Sun_Microsystems.html" title="Sun Microsystems">Sun Microsystems</a>, <a href="/wiki/SAP_AG.html" title="SAP AG">SAP</a>, <a href="/wiki/Hewlett-Packard.html" title="Hewlett-Packard">Hewlett-Packard</a>, <a href="/wiki/Siemens_AG.html" title="Siemens AG">Siemens AG</a>, <a href="/wiki/Cisco_Systems.html" title="Cisco Systems">Cisco</a> and recently <a href="/wiki/Autodesk.html" title="Autodesk">Autodesk</a> (<a  class="external text" title="http://www.arn.idg.com.au/index.php?taxid=620938001&amp;id=63439861">IDG News Service</a>). Microsoft cross-licensed its patents with Sun, despite being direct competitors, and with Autodesk even though Autodesk has far fewer patents than Microsoft.</p>
<p>The ability to negotiate cross licensing agreements is a major reason that many software companies, including those providing <a href="/wiki/Open_source.html" title="Open source">open source</a> software, file patents. As of June 2006, for example, <a href="/wiki/Red_Hat.html" title="Red Hat">Red Hat</a> has developed a portfolio of 6 issued US patents, 1 issued European patent, 13 pending US patent applications, and 25 pending international PCT (<a href="/wiki/Patent_Cooperation_Treaty.html" title="Patent Cooperation Treaty">Patent Cooperation Treaty</a>) patent applications. Red Hat uses this portfolio to cross license with proprietary software companies (e.g. <a href="/wiki/Microsoft.html" title="Microsoft">Microsoft</a>, <a href="/wiki/IBM.html" title="IBM">IBM</a>) so that they can preserve their freedom to operate. <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.redhat.com/legal/patent_policy.html">[11]</a></p>
<p>Many software patent holders license their patents in exchange for monetary <a href="/wiki/Royalties.html" title="Royalties">royalties</a>. Some patent owners, such as IBM, are in the business of selling the products they patent and view licensing as a way to increase the return on their investment in innovation. IBM generates an additional $US 2 billion per year by licensing.(<a  class="external text" title="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/5578247/site/newsweek/">Newsweek Article</a>).</p>
<p>Other patent holders are in the business of inventing new computer implemented inventions and then commercializing the inventions by licensing the patents to other companies that manufacture the inventions. <a href="/wiki/Walker_Digital.html" title="Walker Digital">Walker Digital</a>, for example, has generated a large patent portfolio from its research efforts, including the basic patent on the <a href="/wiki/Priceline.com.html" title="Priceline.com">Priceline.com</a> reverse auction technology. US universities also fall into this class of patent owners. They collectively generate about $1.4 billion per year through licensing the inventions they develop to both established and start up companies in all fields of technology, including software. <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.autm.org/events/File/FY04%20Licensing%20Survey/04AUTM-USLicSrvy-public.pdf">[12]</a>.</p>
<p>Still other patent holders focus on obtaining patents from original inventors and licensing them to companies that have introduced commercial products into the marketplace after the patents were filed. Some of these patent holders, such as <a href="/wiki/Intellectual_Ventures.html" title="Intellectual Ventures">Intellectual Ventures</a>, are privately held companies financed by large corporations such as Microsoft, <a href="/wiki/Intel.html" title="Intel">Intel</a>, <a href="/wiki/Google.html" title="Google">Google</a>, etc. Others, such as <a href="/wiki/Acacia_Technologies.html" title="Acacia Technologies">Acacia Technologies</a>, are publicly traded companies with institutional investors being the primary shareholders <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://premium.hoovers.com/subscribe/co/overview.xhtml?ID=fffrfkrhrrxhjcxxkh">[13]</a>.</p>
<p>The practice of acquiring patents and licensing them is controversial in the software industry. Companies that have this business model are pejoratively referred to as <a href="/wiki/Patent_troll.html" title="Patent troll">patent trolls</a>. It is an integral part of the business model that patent licensing companies sue infringers that do not take a license. Furthermore, they may take advantage of the fact that many companies will pay a modest license fee (e.g.$100,000 to $1,000,000) for rights to a patent of questionable validity, rather than pay the high legal fees ($2,000,000 on up) to demonstrate in court that the patent is invalid.</p>

<p><a name="Software_Patents_and_Open_Source" id="Software_Patents_and_Open_Source"></a></p>
<h2>Software Patents and Open Source</h2>
<p>Several <a href="/wiki/Free_software.html" title="Free software">free software</a> / <a href="/wiki/Open_source.html" title="Open source">open source</a> initiatives, such as an open source alternative to <a href="/wiki/Dolby.html" title="Dolby">dolby</a> audio compression, have had to be shut down when the owners of patents covering different aspects of the initiatives demanded license fees. The initiatives did not have the budget to pay the license fees.<a  class="external autonumber" title="http://swpat.ffii.org/patents/effects/">[14]</a>. This has lead to tremendous animosity in the open source community towards patents (see <a href="/wiki/Software_patent_debate.html" title="Software patent debate">Software patent debate</a>).</p>
<p>Several proprietary software companies, such as IBM, have granted royalty free licenses to open source initiatives. Novell has gone further by committing to actively use its patent portfolio against companies that bring actions against certain open source products. These actions, however, cover only a small fraction of existing software patents.</p>
<p>Ironically, open source solutions are creating copyright infringement problems for proprietary software companies. The developers of proprietary software often incorporate open source code into their systems. This may violate the copyright licenses of said open source code if the proprietary companies do not make their code similarly available. Systems, such as <a  class="external text" title="http://www.internetnews.com/dev-news/article.php/3512106">blackduck</a>, are available to scan software to determine if it contains copyrighted open source code.</p>
