<p><b>Miles Dewey Davis III</b> (<a href="/wiki/May_26.html" title="May 26">May 26</a>, <a href="/wiki/1926.html" title="1926">1926</a> – <a href="/wiki/September_28.html" title="September 28">September 28</a>, <a href="/wiki/1991.html" title="1991">1991</a>) was one of the most influential and innovative <a href="/wiki/Musician.html" title="Musician">musicians</a> of the 20th century. A <a href="/wiki/Trumpet.html" title="Trumpet">trumpeter</a>, <a href="/wiki/Bandleader.html" title="Bandleader">bandleader</a> and <a href="/wiki/Composer.html" title="Composer">composer</a>, Davis was at the forefront of almost every major development in <a href="/wiki/Jazz.html" title="Jazz">jazz</a> from <a href="/wiki/World_War_II.html" title="World War II">World War II</a> to the 1990s. He played on some of the important early <a href="/wiki/Bebop.html" title="Bebop">bebop</a> records and recorded the first <a href="/wiki/Cool_jazz.html" title="Cool jazz">cool jazz</a> records. He was partially responsible for the development of <a href="/wiki/Modal_jazz.html" title="Modal jazz">modal jazz</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Jazz_fusion.html" title="Jazz fusion">jazz fusion</a> arose from his work with other musicians in the late 1960s and early 1970s. <a href="/wiki/Free_jazz.html" title="Free jazz">Free jazz</a> was the only post-war style not significantly influenced by Davis, although some musicians from his bands later pursued this style. His <a href="/wiki/Sound_recording.html" title="Sound recording">recordings</a>, along with the live performances of his many influential bands, were vital in jazz's acceptance as music with lasting artistic value. A popularizer as well as an innovator, Davis became famous for his languid, melodic style and his laconic, and at times confrontational, personality. As an increasingly well-paid and <a href="/wiki/Fashion.html" title="Fashion">fashionably-dressed</a> jazz musician, Davis was also a symbol of jazz music's commercial potential.</p>
<p>Davis was late in a line of jazz trumpeters that started with <a href="/wiki/Buddy_Bolden.html" title="Buddy Bolden">Buddy Bolden</a> and ran through <a href="/wiki/Joe_%22King%22_Oliver.html" title="Joe &quot;King&quot; Oliver">Joe "King" Oliver</a>, <a href="/wiki/Louis_Armstrong.html" title="Louis Armstrong">Louis Armstrong</a>, <a href="/wiki/Roy_Eldridge.html" title="Roy Eldridge">Roy Eldridge</a> and <a href="/wiki/Dizzy_Gillespie.html" title="Dizzy Gillespie">Dizzy Gillespie</a>. He has been compared to <a href="/wiki/Duke_Ellington.html" title="Duke Ellington">Duke Ellington</a> as a musical innovator: both were skillful players on their instruments, but were not considered technical virtuosos. Ellington's main strength was as a composer and leader of a large band, while Davis had a talent for drawing together talented musicians in small groups and allowing them space to develop. Many of the major figures in post-war jazz played in one of Davis's groups at some point in their career.</p>
<p>Davis was posthumously inducted into the <a href="/wiki/Rock_and_Roll_Hall_of_Fame.html" title="Rock and Roll Hall of Fame">Rock and Roll Hall of Fame</a> on March 13, 2006. He has also been inducted into the <a href="/wiki/St._Louis_Walk_of_Fame.html" title="St. Louis Walk of Fame">St. Louis Walk of Fame</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/Big_Band_and_Jazz_Hall_of_Fame.html" title="Big Band and Jazz Hall of Fame">Big Band and Jazz Hall of Fame</a>.

<h3>Early life (1926 to 1945)</h3>
<p>Miles Dewey Davis III was born into a relatively wealthy <a href="/wiki/African-American.html" title="African-American">African-American</a> family living in <a href="/wiki/Alton%2C_Illinois.html" title="Alton, Illinois">Alton, Illinois</a>. His father, <a  class="new" title="Miles Dewey Davis II">Miles Dewey Davis II</a>, was a <a href="/wiki/Dentistry.html" title="Dentistry">dentist</a>, and in 1927 the family moved to <a href="/wiki/East_St._Louis.html" title="East St. Louis">East St. Louis</a>. They also owned a substantial ranch, and Davis learned to ride horses as a boy.</p>
<p>Davis's mother, Cleota Henry Davis, wanted Davis to learn the <a href="/wiki/Violin.html" title="Violin">violin</a>—she was a capable <a href="/wiki/Blues.html" title="Blues">blues</a> <a href="/wiki/Pianist.html" title="Pianist">pianist</a>, but kept this hidden from her son, feeling that "negro" music was not sufficiently genteel. At the age of nine, one of Davis's father's friends gave him his first <a href="/wiki/Trumpet.html" title="Trumpet">trumpet</a>, but he did not start learning to play seriously until the age of thirteen, when his father gave him a new trumpet and arranged lessons with local trumpeter <a href="/wiki/Elwood_Buchanan.html" title="Elwood Buchanan">Elwood Buchanan</a>. Against the fashion of the time, Buchanan stressed the importance of playing without <a href="/wiki/Vibrato.html" title="Vibrato">vibrato</a>, and Davis would carry his clear signature tone throughout his career. Davis once remarked on this importance of this signature sound, saying, “I prefer a round sound with no attitude in it, like a round voice with not too much tremolo and not too much bass. Just right in the middle. If I can’t get that sound I can’t play anything.” <sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a  title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Clark_Terry.html" title="Clark Terry">Clark Terry</a> was another important early influence and friend of Davis's. By the age of sixteen, Davis was a member of the musician's union and working professionally when not at <a href="/wiki/High_school.html" title="High school">high school</a>. At seventeen, he spent a year playing in bandleader <a  class="new" title="Eddie Randle">Eddie Randle</a>'s "Blue Devils". During this time, <a href="/wiki/Sonny_Stitt.html" title="Sonny Stitt">Sonny Stitt</a> tried to persuade him to join the <a href="/wiki/Tiny_Bradshaw.html" title="Tiny Bradshaw">Tiny Bradshaw</a> band then passing through town, but Cleota insisted that he finish his final year of high school.</p>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/1944_in_music.html" title="1944 in music">1944</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Billy_Eckstine.html" title="Billy Eckstine">Billy Eckstine</a> band visited St. Louis. <a href="/wiki/Dizzy_Gillespie.html" title="Dizzy Gillespie">Dizzy Gillespie</a> and <a href="/wiki/Charlie_Parker.html" title="Charlie Parker">Charlie Parker</a> were members of the band, and Davis was taken on as third trumpet for a couple of weeks because of the illness of <a  class="new" title="Buddy Anderson">Buddy Anderson</a>. When Eckstine's band left Davis behind to complete the tour, the trumpeter's parents were still keen for him to continue formal academic studies.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/1944_in_music.html" title="1944 in music">1944</a> Davis moved to <a href="/wiki/New_York_City.html" title="New York City">New York City</a>, ostensibly to take up a scholarship at the <a href="/wiki/Juilliard_School_of_Music.html" title="Juilliard School of Music">Juilliard School of Music</a>. In reality, however, he neglected his studies and immediately set about tracking down <a href="/wiki/Charlie_Parker.html" title="Charlie Parker">Charlie Parker</a>. His first recordings were made in 1945, and he was soon a member of Parker's quintet, appearing on many of Parker's seminal <a href="/wiki/Bebop.html" title="Bebop">bebop</a> recordings for the <a href="/wiki/Savoy_Records.html" title="Savoy Records">Savoy</a> and <a href="/wiki/Dial_Records.html" title="Dial Records">Dial</a> labels. Davis's style on trumpet was already distinctive by this point, but as a soloist he lacked the confidence and virtuosity of his mentors, and was known to play <a  class="new" title="Throttled note">throttled notes</a> (a trademark of Davis's) and to sometimes stumble during his solos.</p>
<p>By <a href="/wiki/1948_in_music.html" title="1948 in music">1948</a> he had served his apprenticeship as a sideman, both on stage and record, and a recording career of his own was beginning to blossom. Davis began to work with a <a href="/wiki/Nonet_%28music%29.html" title="Nonet (music)">nonet</a> that featured then-unusual instrumentation such as the <a href="/wiki/Horn_%28instrument%29.html" title="Horn (instrument)">French horn</a> and <a href="/wiki/Tuba.html" title="Tuba">tuba</a>. The nonet featured a young <a href="/wiki/Gerry_Mulligan.html" title="Gerry Mulligan">Gerry Mulligan</a> and <a href="/wiki/Lee_Konitz.html" title="Lee Konitz">Lee Konitz</a>. After some gigs at New York's Royal Roost, Davis was signed by <a href="/wiki/Capitol_Records.html" title="Capitol Records">Capitol Records</a>. The nonet released several singles in 1949 and 1950, featuring arrangements by <a href="/wiki/Gil_Evans.html" title="Gil Evans">Gil Evans</a>, <a href="/wiki/Gerry_Mulligan.html" title="Gerry Mulligan">Gerry Mulligan</a> and <a href="/wiki/John_Lewis_%28pianist%29.html" title="John Lewis (pianist)">John Lewis</a>. This began his collaboration with Evans, with whom he would collaborate on many of his major works over the next twenty years. The sides saw only limited release until 1957, when eleven of the twelve were released as the album <i><a href="/wiki/Birth_of_the_Cool.html" title="Birth of the Cool">Birth of the Cool</a></i> (more recent issues collect all twelve sides).</p>
<p>Between 1950 and 1955, Davis mainly recorded as a leader for <a href="/wiki/Prestige_Records.html" title="Prestige Records">Prestige</a> and <a href="/wiki/Blue_Note.html" title="Blue Note">Blue Note</a> records in a variety of small group settings. Sidemen included <a href="/wiki/Sonny_Rollins.html" title="Sonny Rollins">Sonny Rollins</a>, <a href="/wiki/John_Lewis_%28pianist%29.html" title="John Lewis (pianist)">John Lewis</a>, <a href="/wiki/Kenny_Clarke.html" title="Kenny Clarke">Kenny Clarke</a>, <a href="/wiki/Jackie_McLean.html" title="Jackie McLean">Jackie McLean</a>, <a href="/wiki/Art_Blakey.html" title="Art Blakey">Art Blakey</a>, <a href="/wiki/Horace_Silver.html" title="Horace Silver">Horace Silver</a>, <a href="/wiki/Thelonious_Monk.html" title="Thelonious Monk">Thelonious Monk</a>, <a href="/wiki/J._J._Johnson.html" title="J. J. Johnson">J. J.

Davis was influenced at around this time by pianist <a href="/wiki/Ahmad_Jamal.html" title="Ahmad Jamal">Ahmad Jamal</a>, whose sparse style contrasted with the "busy" sound of bebop.</p>
<p>Playing in the jazz clubs of New York, Davis was in frequent contact with users and dealers of <a href="/wiki/Recreational_drug_use.html" title="Recreational drug use">drugs</a>, and by <a href="/wiki/1950_in_music.html" title="1950 in music">1950</a>, in common with many of his contemporaries, he had developed a serious <a href="/wiki/Heroin.html" title="Heroin">heroin</a> addiction. For the first part of that decade, although he gigged a great deal and played many sessions, they were mostly uninspired, and it seemed that his talent was going to waste. No one was more aware of this than Davis himself, and his wife. In the winter of 1953-1954 he returned to East St. Louis and locked himself in a guest room in his father's farm for seven days until the drug was fully out of his system.</p>
<p>After overcoming his heroin addiction, Davis made a series of important recordings for Prestige in <a href="/wiki/1954_in_music.html" title="1954 in music">1954</a>, later collected on <i><a href="/wiki/Bags%27_Groove.html" title="Bags' Groove">Bags' Groove</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Miles_Davis_and_the_Modern_Jazz_Giants.html" title="Miles Davis and the Modern Jazz Giants">Miles Davis and the Modern Jazz Giants</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Walkin%27.html" title="Walkin'">Walkin'</a></i>. At this time he started to use the Harmon <a href="/wiki/Mute_%28music%29.html" title="Mute (music)">mute</a> to darken and subdue the <a href="/wiki/Timbre.html" title="Timbre">timbre</a> of his trumpet, and this muted trumpet tone was to be associated with Davis for the rest of his career.</p>
<p>However, the 1954 recordings were not released immediately, and the recovery of his popularity with the jazz public and critics had to wait until July 1955, when he played a legendary solo on Monk's "<a href="/wiki/%27Round_Midnight_%28song%29.html" title="'Round Midnight (song)">'Round Midnight</a>" at the <a href="/wiki/Newport_Jazz_Festival.html" title="Newport Jazz Festival">Newport Jazz Festival</a>. This performance thrust Davis back into the jazz spotlight, leading to George Avakian signing Davis to Columbia and the formation of his first quintet.</p>

<h3>First Great Quintet and Sextet (1955 to 1958)</h3>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/1955_in_music.html" title="1955 in music">1955</a>, Davis formed the first incarnation of the renowned Miles Davis Quintet. This band featured <a href="/wiki/John_Coltrane.html" title="John Coltrane">John Coltrane</a> (<a href="/wiki/Tenor_saxophone.html" title="Tenor saxophone">tenor saxophone</a>), <a href="/wiki/Red_Garland.html" title="Red Garland">Red Garland</a> (<a href="/wiki/Piano.html" title="Piano">piano</a>), <a href="/wiki/Paul_Chambers.html" title="Paul Chambers">Paul Chambers</a> (<a href="/wiki/Double_bass.html" title="Double bass">double bass</a>) and <a href="/wiki/Philly_Joe_Jones.html" title="Philly Joe Jones">Philly Joe Jones</a> (<a href="/wiki/Drums.html" title="Drums">drums</a>). Musically, the band picked up where Davis's late 1940s sessions had left off. Eschewing the rhythmic and harmonic complexity of the then-prevalent bebop, Davis was allowed the space to play long, <a href="/wiki/Legato.html" title="Legato">legato</a>, and essentially <a href="/wiki/Melody.html" title="Melody">melodic</a> lines in which he would begin to explore <a href="/wiki/Musical_mode.html" title="Musical mode">modal music</a>. Davis still admired Ahmad Jamal, and the quintet's music reflects his influence as well, in the choice of repertoire and in Davis's directives to Garland.</p>

<p>The first recordings of this group were made for <a href="/wiki/Columbia_Records.html" title="Columbia Records">Columbia Records</a> in 1955, released on <i><a href="/wiki/%27Round_About_Midnight.html" title="'Round About Midnight">'Round About Midnight</a></i>. Davis was still under contract to Prestige, but had an agreement that he could make recordings for subsequent releases using his new label. His final recordings for Prestige were the product of two days of recording in 1956, released as <i><a href="/wiki/Relaxin%27_with_the_Miles_Davis_Quintet.html" title="Relaxin' with the Miles Davis Quintet">Relaxin' with the Miles Davis Quintet</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Steamin%27_with_the_Miles_Davis_Quintet.html" title="Steamin' with the Miles Davis Quintet">Steamin' with the Miles Davis Quintet</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Workin%27_with_the_Miles_Davis_Quintet.html" title="Workin' with the Miles Davis Quintet">Workin' with the Miles Davis Quintet</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Cookin%27_with_the_Miles_Davis_Quintet.html" title="Cookin' with the Miles Davis Quintet">Cookin' with the Miles Davis Quintet</a></i>.</p>
<p>Though today it is often regarded as one of the greatest groups in jazz history, Davis's choice of sidemen received some criticism at the time. Additionally, the quintet was never stable; several of the other members used heroin, and the Miles Davis Quintet disbanded in early <a href="/wiki/1957_in_music.html" title="1957 in music">1957</a>.</p>
<p>In 1958, the quintet reformed as a sextet, with the addition of <a href="/wiki/Julian_Cannonball_Adderley.html" title="Julian Cannonball Adderley">Julian "Cannonball" Adderley</a> on <a href="/wiki/Alto_saxophone.html" title="Alto saxophone">alto saxophone</a>, and recorded <i><a href="/wiki/Milestones_%28album%29.html" title="Milestones (album)">Milestones</a></i>. Musically, it encompasses both the past and the future of jazz. Davis showed that he could play both <a href="/wiki/Blues.html" title="Blues">blues</a> and bebop (ably assisted by Coltrane), but the centerpiece is the title track, a Davis composition centred on the <a href="/wiki/Musical_mode.html" title="Musical mode">Dorian and Aeolian modes</a> and featuring the free improvisatory modal style that Davis would make his own.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>In the late 1950s and early 1960s, Davis recorded a series of albums with <a href="/wiki/Gil_Evans.html" title="Gil Evans">Gil Evans</a>, often playing <a href="/wiki/Flugelhorn.html" title="Flugelhorn">flugelhorn</a> as well as trumpet. The first, <i><a href="/wiki/Miles_Ahead.html" title="Miles Ahead">Miles Ahead</a></i> (1957), showcased his playing with a jazz <a href="/wiki/Big_band.html" title="Big band">big band</a> and a horn section beautifully arranged by Evans. Tunes included <a href="/wiki/Dave_Brubeck.html" title="Dave Brubeck">Dave Brubeck</a>'s "The Duke", as well as <a href="/wiki/L%C3%A9o_Delibes.html" title="Léo Delibes">Léo Delibes</a>'s "The Maids Of Cadiz", the first piece of <a href="/wiki/European_classical_music.html" title="European classical music">European classical music</a> Davis had recorded.</p>
<p>In Davis and Evans's <i><a href="/wiki/Porgy_and_Bess_%28Miles_Davis_album%29.html" title="Porgy and Bess (Miles Davis album)">Porgy and Bess</a></i>, a 1958 arrangement of <a href="/wiki/George_Gershwin.html" title="George Gershwin">George Gershwin</a>'s <i><a href="/wiki/Porgy_and_Bess.html" title="Porgy and Bess">Porgy and Bess</a></i>, the framework of the Gershwin songs provided ample space for Davis to improvise, showing his mastery of variations and expansions on the original themes, as well as his original melodic ideas. Davis named the album one of his own favorites.</p>
<p><i><a href="/wiki/Sketches_of_Spain.html" title="Sketches of Spain">Sketches of Spain</a></i> (1959 to 1960) featured tunes by contemporary Spanish composer <a href="/wiki/Joaquin_Rodrigo.html" title="Joaquin Rodrigo">Joaquin Rodrigo</a> and also <a href="/wiki/Manuel_de_Falla.html" title="Manuel de Falla">Manuel de Falla</a>, as well as Gil Evans originals with a Spanish theme. <i>Miles Davis at Carnegie Hall</i> (<a href="/wiki/1961_in_music.html" title="1961 in music">1961</a>) includes Rodrigo's "Concierto de Aranjuez", along with other tunes recorded at a concert with an orchestra under Evans's direction.</p>
<p>Sessions in <a href="/wiki/1962_in_music.html" title="1962 in music">1962</a> and <a href="/wiki/1963_in_music.html" title="1963 in music">1963</a> resulted in the album <i><a href="/wiki/Quiet_Nights.html" title="Quiet Nights">Quiet Nights</a></i>, a short collection of <a href="/wiki/Bossa_nova.html" title="Bossa nova">bossa nova</a> tunes which was released against the wishes of both Evans and Davis. That was the last time that the two created a full album again, although Evans remained one of Davis' most important musical contributors and friends. Towards the end of his life and after Evans' death, Davis once noted that "Gil was my best friend."</p>

<p>After recording <i>Milestones</i>, Garland and Jones were replaced by <a href="/wiki/Bill_Evans.html" title="Bill Evans">Bill Evans</a> and <a href="/wiki/Jimmy_Cobb.html" title="Jimmy Cobb">Jimmy Cobb</a>. Davis probably hired Evans for his harmonically sophisticated approach. For various reasons, Evans's stay in the group was relatively brief, and he departed late in 1958, replaced by <a href="/wiki/Wynton_Kelly.html" title="Wynton Kelly">Wynton Kelly</a>.</p>
<p>In March and April 1959, Davis re-entered the studio with his working sextet and Bill Evans to record what is widely considered his magnum opus, <i><a href="/wiki/Kind_of_Blue.html" title="Kind of Blue">Kind of Blue</a></i>. The album was planned around Evans's piano style. It was also influenced by concepts that Evans had learned while working with <a href="/wiki/George_Russell.html" title="George Russell">George Russell</a> on the earliest recordings of <a href="/wiki/Modal_jazz.html" title="Modal jazz">modal jazz</a> and passed on to the sextet. Kelly only played on "Freddie Freeloader", and was not present at the April session. "<a href="/wiki/So_What_%28instrumental%29.html" title="So What (instrumental)">So What</a>" and "<a href="/wiki/All_Blues.html" title="All Blues">All Blues</a>" had been played by the sextet at performances prior to the recording sessions, but for the other three compositions, Davis and Evans prepared skeletal harmonic frameworks which the other musicians saw for the first time on the day of recording, in order to generate a fresh and spontaneous <a href="/wiki/Improvisation.html" title="Improvisation">improvisational</a> approach. The resulting album is the best-loved and (according to the <a href="/wiki/RIAA.html" title="RIAA">RIAA</a>) best-selling jazz album ever, and also has proven to be a huge influence on other musicians.</p>
<p>The same year, while taking a break outside the famous <a href="/wiki/Birdland.html" title="Birdland">Birdland</a> night club in <a href="/wiki/New_York_City.html" title="New York City">New York City</a>, Davis was beaten by the <a href="/wiki/New_York_City_Police_Department.html" title="New York City Police Department">New York police</a> and subsequently arrested. Believing the assault to have been racially motivated, he attempted to pursue the case in the courts, before eventually dropping the proceedings. Such treatment was markedly at odds with his treatment outside the U.S., and especially on his regular European tours, where he was fêted by society.</p>
<p>Coltrane, who had been eager to form his own group, was convinced by Davis to play with the group on one final European tour in the spring of 1960. He then departed to form his classic quartet, although he returned for some of the tracks on the 1961 album <i><a href="/wiki/Someday_My_Prince_Will_Come_%28album%29.html" title="Someday My Prince Will Come (album)">Someday My Prince Will Come</a></i>. Davis tried various replacement saxophonists, including <a href="/wiki/Sonny_Stitt.html" title="Sonny Stitt">Sonny Stitt</a> and <a href="/wiki/Hank_Mobley.html" title="Hank Mobley">Hank Mobley</a>. The quintet with Hank Mobley was recorded in the studio and on several live engagements at <a href="/wiki/Carnegie_Hall.html" title="Carnegie Hall">Carnegie Hall</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Black_Hawk_%28nightclub%29.html" title="Black Hawk (nightclub)">Black Hawk supper club</a> in <a href="/wiki/San_Francisco.html" title="San Francisco">San Francisco</a>. Stitt's playing with the group is found on the <i>Live in Stockholm</i> CD.</p>
<p>In 1963, Davis's long-time rhythm section of Kelly, Chambers and Cobb departed. He quickly got to work putting together a new group, including <a href="/wiki/Tenor_saxophone.html" title="Tenor saxophone">tenor saxophonist</a> <a href="/wiki/George_Coleman.html" title="George Coleman">George Coleman</a> and bassist <a href="/wiki/Ron_Carter.html" title="Ron Carter">Ron Carter</a>. Davis, Coleman, Carter and a few other musicians recorded half an album in the spring of 1963. A few weeks later, drummer <a href="/wiki/Tony_Williams.html" title="Tony Williams">Tony Williams</a> and pianist <a href="/wiki/Herbie_Hancock.html" title="Herbie Hancock">Herbie Hancock</a> joined the group, and soon thereafter Davis, Coleman and the young rhythm section recorded the rest of the <i><a href="/wiki/Seven_Steps_to_Heaven_%28album%29.html" title="Seven Steps to Heaven (album)">Seven Steps to Heaven</a></i> album.</p>
<p>The young rhythm section clicked very quickly with each other and the horns; the group's rapid evolution can be traced through the aforementioned studio album, <i><a  class="new" title="In Europe (album)">In Europe</a></i> (July 1963), <i><a  class="new" title="My Funny Valentine (album)">My Funny Valentine</a></i>, and <i><a  class="new" title="Four and More (album)">Four and More</a></i> (both February <a href="/wiki/1964_in_music.html" title="1964 in music">1964</a>). The group played essentially the same repertoire of bebop and standards that earlier Davis bands did, but tackled them with increasing structural and rhythmic freedom and (in the case of the up-tempo material) breakneck speed.</p>
<p>Coleman left in the spring of 1964, to be replaced by <a href="/wiki/Avant-garde.html" title="Avant-garde">avant-garde</a> saxophonist <a href="/wiki/Sam_Rivers.html" title="Sam Rivers">Sam Rivers</a>, on the suggestion of Tony Williams. Davis, however, who knew of Rivers's leanings toward <a href="/wiki/Free_jazz.html" title="Free jazz">free jazz</a>, a genre which Davis disdained, knew that Rivers was not the ideal replacement he was looking for. Rivers remained in the group only briefly, but was recorded live with the quintet in Japan; the group can be heard on <i><a  class="new" title="In Tokyo (album)">In Tokyo</a></i> (July 1964).</p>
<p>By the end of the summer, Davis had managed to convince <a href="/wiki/Wayne_Shorter.html" title="Wayne Shorter">Wayne Shorter</a> to quit <a href="/wiki/Art_Blakey.html" title="Art Blakey">Art Blakey</a>'s Jazz Messengers, a reluctant decision because Shorter had become musical director of that group. Shorter's arrival completed the trumpeter's Second Great Quintet. Surely enough, Shorter became the principal composer of Miles's quintet, and some of his compositions of this era ("Footprints", "Nefertiti") are now standards. While on tour in Europe, the group quickly made their first official recording, <i><a  class="new" title="Miles in Berlin (album)">Miles in Berlin</a></i> (Fall 1964).</p>

<h3>Second Great Quintet (1964 to 1968)</h3>
<p>By the time of <i><a href="/wiki/E.S.P._%28Miles_Davis_album%29.html" title="E.S.P. (Miles Davis album)">E.S.P.</a></i> (<a href="/wiki/1965_in_music.html" title="1965 in music">1965</a>) the lineup (Davis's second great quintet, and the last of his acoustic bands) consisted of <a href="/wiki/Wayne_Shorter.html" title="Wayne Shorter">Wayne Shorter</a> (saxophone), <a href="/wiki/Herbie_Hancock.html" title="Herbie Hancock">Herbie Hancock</a> (piano), <a href="/wiki/Ron_Carter.html" title="Ron Carter">Ron Carter</a> (bass) and <a href="/wiki/Tony_Williams.html" title="Tony Williams">Tony Williams</a> (drums).</p>
<p>A two-night <a href="/wiki/Chicago%2C_Illinois.html" title="Chicago, Illinois">Chicago</a> gig by this band in late 1965 is captured on the 8-CD set <i><a href="/wiki/The_Complete_Live_at_The_Plugged_Nickel_1965.html" title="The Complete Live at The Plugged Nickel 1965">The Complete Live at The Plugged Nickel 1965</a></i> released in 1995. Unlike the group's studio albums, the live engagement still shows the group playing primarily standards and bebop tunes, albeit with a greater degree of freedom than in previous years.</p>
<p>This was followed by a series of strong studio recordings: <i><a href="/wiki/Miles_Smiles_%28album%29.html" title="Miles Smiles (album)">Miles Smiles</a></i> (<a href="/wiki/1966_in_music.html" title="1966 in music">1966</a>), <i><a href="/wiki/Sorcerer_%28album%29.html" title="Sorcerer (album)">Sorcerer</a></i> (<a href="/wiki/1967_in_music.html" title="1967 in music">1967</a>), <i><a href="/wiki/Nefertiti_%28album%29.html" title="Nefertiti (album)">Nefertiti</a></i> (1967), <i><a href="/wiki/Miles_in_the_Sky_%28album%29.html" title="Miles in the Sky (album)">Miles in the Sky</a></i> (1968) and <i><a href="/wiki/Filles_de_Kilimanjaro.html" title="Filles de Kilimanjaro">Filles de Kilimanjaro</a></i> (1968). The quintet's approach to improvisation came to be known as "time no changes" or "freebop", because while they retained a steady pulse, they abandoned the <a href="/wiki/Chord_progression.html" title="Chord progression">chord-change</a>-based approach of bebop for a modal approach. The rhythm section became more free, able to change tempos and time signatures spontaneously. Through <i>Nefertiti</i>, the studio recordings consisted of primarily originals composed by Wayne Shorter, and to a lesser degree the other sidemen. In 1967, the group began the unusual practice of playing their live concerts in continuous sets, with each tune flowing into the next and only the melody indicating any sort of demarcation; Davis's bands would continue to perform in this way until his retirement in 1975.</p>
<p><i>Miles in the Sky</i> and <i>Filles de Kilimanjaro</i>, on which <a href="/wiki/Electric_bass.html" title="Electric bass">electric bass</a>, <a href="/wiki/Electric_piano.html" title="Electric piano">electric piano</a> and <a href="/wiki/Guitar.html" title="Guitar">guitar</a> were tentatively introduced on some tracks, clearly pointed the way to the subsequent <a href="/wiki/Jazz_fusion.html" title="Jazz fusion">fusion</a> phase in Davis's output. Davis also began experimenting with more <a href="/wiki/Rock_%28music%29.html" title="Rock (music)">rock</a>-oriented rhythms on these records, and by the time the second half of <i>Filles de Kilimanjaro</i> had been recorded, <a href="/wiki/Dave_Holland.html" title="Dave Holland">Dave Holland</a> and <a href="/wiki/Chick_Corea.html" title="Chick Corea">Chick Corea</a> had replaced Carter and Hancock in the working band, though both Carter and Hancock would contribute to future recording sessions. Davis soon began to take over the compositional duties of his sidemen.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>Recent boxed sets have shown that Davis's progression from the "free-bop" (or postbop) of the Second Quintet to the dense, rhythmic world of fusion was much less abrupt than it seemed initially, when <i><a href="/wiki/In_a_Silent_Way.html" title="In a Silent Way">In a Silent Way</a></i> followed <i>Filles de Kilimanjaro</i>. Miles's influences, widely attributed to the tastes of his future wife <a href="/wiki/Betty_Davis.html" title="Betty Davis">Betty Mabry</a>, were the late 1960s acid, funk and rock heroes, namely <a href="/wiki/Sly_and_the_Family_Stone.html" title="Sly and the Family Stone">Sly and the Family Stone</a>, <a href="/wiki/James_Brown_%28musician%29.html" title="James Brown (musician)">James Brown</a> and <a href="/wiki/Jimi_Hendrix.html" title="Jimi Hendrix">Jimi Hendrix</a>. Slightly later, most prominently on <a href="/wiki/1972_in_music.html" title="1972 in music">1972</a>'s <i>On the Corner</i>, the influence of <a href="/wiki/Karlheinz_Stockhausen.html" title="Karlheinz Stockhausen">Karlheinz Stockhausen</a> became evident. This transition required that Davis and his band adapt to modern, electric instruments in both live performances and the studio.</p>
<p>By the time <i>In a Silent Way</i> had been recorded in February 1969, Davis had augmented his standard quintet with additional players. Hancock and <a href="/wiki/Joe_Zawinul.html" title="Joe Zawinul">Joe Zawinul</a> were brought in to assist Corea on electric keyboards, and the young guitarist <a href="/wiki/John_McLaughlin_%28musician%29.html" title="John McLaughlin (musician)">John McLaughlin</a> made the first of his many appearances with Miles at this time. By this point, Wayne Shorter was also doubling on soprano saxophone. After the recording of this album, <a href="/wiki/Tony_Williams.html" title="Tony Williams">Tony Williams</a> left to form his group <a  class="new" title="Tony Williams Lifetime">Lifetime</a> and was replaced by <a href="/wiki/Jack_DeJohnette.html" title="Jack DeJohnette">Jack DeJohnette</a>.</p>
<p>Six months later, an even larger group of musicians, including <a href="/wiki/Jack_DeJohnette.html" title="Jack DeJohnette">Jack DeJohnette</a>, <a href="/wiki/Airto_Moreira.html" title="Airto Moreira">Airto Moreira</a> and <a href="/wiki/Bennie_Maupin.html" title="Bennie Maupin">Bennie Maupin</a>, recorded <i><a href="/wiki/Bitches_Brew.html" title="Bitches Brew">Bitches Brew</a></i>. These two records were the first truly successful amalgamations of jazz with <a href="/wiki/Rock_%28music%29.html" title="Rock (music)">rock music</a>, laying the groundwork for the genre that would become known simply as "<a href="/wiki/Jazz-rock_fusion.html" title="Jazz-rock fusion">fusion</a>".</p>
<p>Both <i>Bitches Brew</i> and <i>In a Silent Way</i> feature "extended" (more than 20 minutes each) compositions which were never actually "played straight through" by the musicians in the studio. Instead, Miles and producer <a href="/wiki/Teo_Macero.html" title="Teo Macero">Teo Macero</a> selected musical motifs of various lengths from recorded extended improvisations and edited them together into a musical whole which only exists in the recorded version. <i>Bitches Brew</i>, in particular, is a case study in the use of electronic effects, multi-tracking, tape loops and other editing techniques.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>During this period, Davis toured with the "Lost Quintet" of Shorter, Corea, Holland and DeJohnette. Though Corea played electric piano and the group occasionally hinted at rock rhythms, the music was edgy, uncompromising post-bop that frequently spilled over into full-blown <a href="/wiki/Free_jazz.html" title="Free jazz">free jazz</a>. The group's repertoire included material from <i>Bitches Brew</i>, <i>In a Silent Way</i>, the 1960s quintet albums, and an occasional standard.</p>
<p>Both records, especially <i>Bitches Brew</i>, proved to be huge sellers for Davis, and he was accused of "selling out" by many of his former fans, while simultaneously attracting many new fans who listened to Davis alongside the more popular rock acts of the late 1960s.</p>
<p>Davis reached out to new audiences in other ways as well. Starting with <i>Bitches Brew</i>, Davis's albums began to often feature art much more in line with <a href="/wiki/Psychedelic_art.html" title="Psychedelic art">psychedelic</a> or <a href="/wiki/Black_power.html" title="Black power">black power</a> movements than with his earlier albums' art. He took significant cuts in his usual performing fees in order to open for <a href="/wiki/Rock_%28music%29.html" title="Rock (music)">rock</a> groups like the <a href="/wiki/Steve_Miller_Band.html" title="Steve Miller Band">Steve Miller Band</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Grateful_Dead.html" title="Grateful Dead">Grateful Dead</a> and <a href="/wiki/Carlos_Santana.html" title="Carlos Santana">Santana</a>. (<a href="/wiki/Carlos_Santana.html" title="Carlos Santana">Carlos Santana</a> has stated that he should have opened concerts for Davis, rather than the other way around.) Several live albums were recorded during the early 1970s at such performances: <i><a  title="Live at the Fillmore East, March 7, 1970: It's About That Time">It's About That Time</a></i> (March 1970; Shorter's last appearance with the group), <i>Black Beauty</i> (April 1970; <a  class="new" title="Steve Grossman">Steve Grossman</a> replacing Shorter on saxophones) and <i><a  title="Miles Davis at Fillmore: Live at the Fillmore East">At Fillmore</a></i> (June 1970; <a href="/wiki/Keith_Jarrett.html" title="Keith Jarrett">Keith Jarrett</a> joining the group as a second keyboardist). In contrast with the Lost Quintet, the music on these albums is <a href="/wiki/Funk.html" title="Funk">funkier</a> and more <a href="/wiki/Rock_%28music%29.html" title="Rock (music)">rock</a>-oriented, with relatively few free jazz tendencies. Corea began to rely heavily on effects like <a href="/wiki/Ring_modulation.html" title="Ring modulation">ring modulation</a>, and Dave Holland shifted to the electric <a href="/wiki/Bass_guitar.html" title="Bass guitar">bass</a> (having primarily played acoustic bass for the previous year).</p>
<p>By the time of <i>Live-Evil</i> (December 1970; Jarrett as the only keyboardist, <a href="/wiki/Gary_Bartz.html" title="Gary Bartz">Gary Bartz</a> replacing Grossman on saxophones, and <a href="/wiki/Michael_Henderson.html" title="Michael Henderson">Michael Henderson</a> replacing Holland on electric bass, <a href="/wiki/Airto_Moreira.html" title="Airto Moreira">Airto Moreira</a> percussion), Davis's ensemble had transformed into a much more funk-oriented group. Davis began experimenting with <a href="/wiki/Wah-wah.html" title="Wah-wah">wah-wah</a> effects on his horn. The ensemble with Bartz, Jarrett and Henderson, often referred to as the "Cellar Door band" (the live portions of <i>Live-Evil</i> were recorded at a club by that name), never recorded in the studio, but is documented in the six CD Box Set "The Cellar Door Sessions" which was recorded over four nights in December of 1970.</p>
<p>The year 1970 saw Davis contribute extensively to the soundtrack of a documentary about the great African-American boxer <a href="/wiki/Jack_Johnson_%28boxer%29.html" title="Jack Johnson (boxer)">Jack Johnson</a>. A devotee of <a href="/wiki/Boxing.html" title="Boxing">boxing</a>, Davis drew parallels between Johnson, whose career had been defined by the fruitless search for a Great White Hope to dethrone him, and Davis's own career, in which he felt the establishment had prevented him from receiving the acclaim and rewards that were due him. The resulting album, <a href="/wiki/1971_in_music.html" title="1971 in music">1971</a>'s <i><a href="/wiki/A_Tribute_to_Jack_Johnson.html" title="A Tribute to Jack Johnson">A Tribute to Jack Johnson</a></i>, contained two long pieces that utilised the talents of many musicians, some of whom were not credited on the record, including the guitarists <a href="/wiki/John_McLaughlin_%28musician%29.html" title="John McLaughlin (musician)">John McLaughlin</a> and <a href="/wiki/Sonny_Sharrock.html" title="Sonny Sharrock">Sonny Sharrock</a>. Working with producer <a href="/wiki/Teo_Macero.html" title="Teo Macero">Teo Macero</a>, Davis created what many critics regard as his finest electric, rock-influenced album, though its use of editing and studio technology would be fully appreciated only upon the release of the five-CD <i><a href="/wiki/The_Complete_Jack_Johnson_Sessions.html" title="The Complete Jack Johnson Sessions">The Complete Jack Johnson Sessions</a></i> in <a href="/wiki/2003_in_music.html" title="2003 in music">2003</a>.</p>
<p>Davis refused to be confined by the expectations of his traditional audience or music critics, and continued to explore the possibilities of his new band. As he stated in his autobiography, he wanted to make music for the young afro-american audience. <i><a href="/wiki/On_The_Corner.html" title="On The Corner">On The Corner</a></i> (<a href="/wiki/1972_in_music.html" title="1972 in music">1972</a>) showed a seemingly effortless grasp of <a href="/wiki/Funk.html" title="Funk">funk</a> without sacrificing the rhythmic, melodic and harmonic nuance that had been present throughout his career. The album also showed the influences of <a href="/wiki/Paul_Buckmaster.html" title="Paul Buckmaster">Paul Buckmaster</a>'s studio arrangements and <a href="/wiki/Karlheinz_Stockhausen.html" title="Karlheinz Stockhausen">Stockhausen</a> in its layered recording and post-production editing. The album was highlighted by the appearance of saxophonist <a href="/wiki/Carlos_Garnett.html" title="Carlos Garnett">Carlos Garnett</a>. The record provoked fierce disparagement from many critics, with one British critic noting: "I love Miles, but this is where I get off." In his autobiography, Davis stated that this criticism was made because no critic could categorize this music and complained that <i><a href="/wiki/On_the_Corner.html" title="On the Corner">On the Corner</a></i> was promoted by the "traditional" jazz radio stations, therefore not to young African-americans. Miles himself thought that the record would be "something for black people to remember me by".</p>
<p>After recording <i>On the Corner</i>, Davis put together a new band, with only <a href="/wiki/Michael_Henderson.html" title="Michael Henderson">Michael Henderson</a>, <a href="/wiki/Carlos_Garnett.html" title="Carlos Garnett">Carlos Garnett</a> and percussionist <a href="/wiki/Mtume.html" title="Mtume">Mtume</a> returning from the Cellar Door band. It included guitarist <a href="/wiki/Reggie_Lucas.html" title="Reggie Lucas">Reggie Lucas</a>, tabla player <a href="/wiki/Badal_Roy.html" title="Badal Roy">Badal Roy</a>, sitarist <a  class="new" title="Khalil Balakrishna">Khalil Balakrishna</a> and drummer <a href="/wiki/Al_Foster.html" title="Al Foster">Al Foster</a>. It was unusual in that none of the sidemen were major jazz instrumentalists; as a result, the music emphasized rhythmic density and shifting textures instead of individual solos. This group, which recorded in the <a href="/wiki/Philharmonic_Hall.html" title="Philharmonic Hall">Philharmonic Hall</a> for the album <i><a  class="new" title="In Concert: Live at Philharmonic Hall">In Concert</a></i> (1972), was unsatisfactory to Davis. Through the first half of <a href="/wiki/1973_in_music.html" title="1973 in music">1973</a>, he dropped the tabla and sitar, took over keyboard duties, and added guitarist <a href="/wiki/Pete_Cosey.html" title="Pete Cosey">Pete Cosey</a>. The Davis/Cosey/Lucas/Henderson/Mtume/Foster ensemble would remain virtually intact over the next two years. Initially, <a href="/wiki/Dave_Liebman.html" title="Dave Liebman">Dave Liebman</a> played saxophones and flute with the band; in <a href="/wiki/1974_in_music.html" title="1974 in music">1974</a> he was replaced by <a href="/wiki/Sonny_Fortune.html" title="Sonny Fortune">Sonny Fortune</a>.</p>
<p>By the mid-1970s, Davis's previous rate of production was falling. <i><a href="/wiki/Big_Fun_%28album%29.html" title="Big Fun (album)">Big Fun</a></i> (1974) was a double album containing four long jams, recorded between 1969 and 1972. Similarly, <i><a href="/wiki/Get_Up_With_It.html" title="Get Up With It">Get Up With It</a></i> (<a href="/wiki/1975_in_music.html" title="1975 in music">1975</a>) collected recordings from the previous five years. <i>Get Up With It</i> included "He Loved Him Madly", a tribute to <a href="/wiki/Duke_Ellington.html" title="Duke Ellington">Duke Ellington</a>, as well as one of Davis's most lauded pieces from this era, "Calypso Frelimo". Contemporary critics complained that the album had too many underdeveloped ideas. This was his last studio album of the seventies.</p>
<p>In 1974 and 1975, Columbia recorded three double-LP live Davis albums: <i>Dark Magus</i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Agharta_%28album%29.html" title="Agharta (album)">Agharta</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Pangaea_%28album%29.html" title="Pangaea (album)">Pangaea</a></i>. <i>Dark Magus</i> is a 1974 New York concert; the latter two are recordings of consecutive concerts from the same February 1975 day in <a href="/wiki/Osaka.html" title="Osaka">Osaka</a>, <a href="/wiki/Japan.html" title="Japan">Japan</a>. At the time, only <i>Agharta</i> was available in the US; <i>Pangaea</i> and <i>Dark Magus</i> were initially released only by CBS/Sony Japan. All three feature at least two electric guitarists (Reggie Lucas and Pete Cosey, deploying an array of post-Jimi Hendrix electronic distortion devices; Dominique Gaumont is a third guitarist on <i>Dark Magus</i>), electric bass (Davis still relying on the funk-tinged, stripped-down playing of Michael Henderson), drums, reeds, and Davis on trumpet (also electrified) and organ. These albums, documenting the working bands Miles was leading at that point, were the last music he was to record for five years. Troubled by <a href="/wiki/Osteoarthritis.html" title="Osteoarthritis">osteoarthritis</a> (which led to a hip replacement operation in 1976, the first of several), <a href="/wiki/Clinical_depression.html" title="Clinical depression">depression</a>, <a href="/wiki/Bursitis.html" title="Bursitis">bursitis</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ulcers.html" title="Ulcers">ulcers</a>, <a href="/wiki/Rheumatism.html" title="Rheumatism">rheumatism</a> and a renewed dependence on alcohol and illegal drugs (primarily <a href="/wiki/Cocaine.html" title="Cocaine">cocaine</a> and <a href="/wiki/Heroin.html" title="Heroin">heroin</a>), Davis' performances were routinely panned throughout late 1974 and early 1975; during a performance at a small club in San Francisco, he only played a few jagged, atonal figures on organ and wah-wahed trumpet, spending the majority of the three hour concert dancing to his band. By the time the group reached Japan in February of 1975, Davis was teetering on a physical breakdown and required copious amounts of vodka and morphine to complete his engagements.</p>
<p>Immediately thereafter, Davis withdrew almost completely from the public eye for five years. As Gil Evans euphemistically said, "His organism is tired. And after all the music he's contributed for 35 years, he needs a rest."</p>
<p>The period is characterized as a colorful time by Davis in his memoirs, where wealthy Caucasian women would ostensibly lavish him with sex and drugs. In reality, he had become completely dependent upon cocaine and heroin, spending nearly all of his time propped up on a couch in his apartment watching television, leaving only to score. In 1976, <i>Rolling Stone</i> reported of rumors circulating of his imminent demise. Most of Davis' oldest allies and collaborators in the jazz community, already aghast at the polarizing music of the 1969–1975 period, found this development to be the culmination of his hubris and shunned him. Although he stopped practicing <a href="/wiki/Trumpet.html" title="Trumpet">trumpet</a> on a regular basis, Davis continued to compose intermittently and made three attempts at recording during his exile from performing; these sessions (one with the assistance of Paul Buckmaster and Gil Evans, who left after not receiving promised compensation) bore little fruit and remain unreleased.</p>
<p>Despite being a pariah among jazz musicians, as with any prolific and respected artist who abruptly stops for mysterious reasons Davis' legend grew exponentially among listeners, as Columbia continued to issue compilation albums and records of unreleased vault material to fufill contractual obligations. This was evidenced in 1979 when he placed in the yearly Top 10 trumpeter poll of <i>Downbeat</i> magazine.</p>
<p>During his period of inactivity, Davis saw the fusion music that he had spearheaded over the past decade firmly enter into the mainstream. Whether played by Davis's many protégés, including <a href="/wiki/Herbie_Hancock.html" title="Herbie Hancock">Herbie Hancock</a>, <a href="/wiki/Chick_Corea.html" title="Chick Corea">Chick Corea</a> with his groundbreaking fusion group <a href="/wiki/Return_to_Forever.html" title="Return to Forever">Return to Forever</a>, <a href="/wiki/John_McLaughlin_%28musician%29.html" title="John McLaughlin (musician)">John McLaughlin</a>'s <a href="/wiki/Mahavishnu_Orchestra.html" title="Mahavishnu Orchestra">Mahavishnu Orchestra</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/Weather_Report.html" title="Weather Report">Weather Report</a> (founders <a href="/wiki/Wayne_Shorter.html" title="Wayne Shorter">Wayne Shorter</a> and <a href="/wiki/Joe_Zawinul.html" title="Joe Zawinul">Joe Zawinul</a> both spent time in Davis's bands), Davis's influence could be heard everywhere, much as it could after each of his previous revolutionary advances. Even though he had maintained cordial relations with all of these musicians prior to 1975 and would remain good friends with drummer <a href="/wiki/Jack_DeJohnette.html" title="Jack DeJohnette">Jack DeJohnette</a> and McLaughlin until his death, he remained very envious of the crossover success enjoyed by his former sidemen and found a string of concerts opening for Hancock in late 1975 as being demeaning to his ego. When he did emerge from retirement, Davis' musical antecedents would be in the realm of <a href="/wiki/New_Wave_music.html" title="New Wave music">New Wave</a> and in particular the stylings of <a href="/wiki/Prince_%28musician%29.html" title="Prince (musician)">Prince</a>.</p>
<p>Davis's 1970s recordings have in recent years undergone a fairly radical reassessment, and are now seen by many as a significant body of work comparable to that of his earlier periods, and as an extremely interesting mixture of ideas gleaned from jazz, funk and rock music, as well as from experimental, "process-oriented" European composers. Recently, <a href="/wiki/Dave_Douglas.html" title="Dave Douglas">Dave Douglas</a>, <a href="/wiki/Wadada_Leo_Smith.html" title="Wadada Leo Smith">Wadada Leo Smith</a>, <a href="/wiki/Mark_Isham.html" title="Mark Isham">Mark Isham</a>, <a href="/wiki/Tim_Hagans.html" title="Tim Hagans">Tim Hagans</a>, <a href="/wiki/Nicholas_Payton.html" title="Nicholas Payton">Nicholas Payton</a> and others have recorded albums more or less indebted to Davis's electric era.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Last Decade (1981 to 1991)">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Last_Decade_.281981_to_1991.29" id="Last_Decade_.281981_to_1991.29"></a></p>
<h3>Last Decade (1981 to 1991)</h3>
<p>By 1979, Davis had rekindled his relationship with actress <a href="/wiki/Cicely_Tyson.html" title="Cicely Tyson">Cicely Tyson</a>, who had entered the field of superstardom after appearing in <i>Roots</i>. With Tyson, Davis would fully detoxify and regain his enthusiasm for music. As he had not played trumpet for the better part of three years, regaining his famed <a href="/wiki/Embouchure.html" title="Embouchure">embouchure</a> proved to be particularly arduous. While recording <i><a href="/wiki/The_Man_With_The_Horn.html" title="The Man With The Horn">The Man With The Horn</a></i> (sessions were spread sporadically over 1979-1981), Davis attempted to cover his perceived technical deficiencies by playing mostly wah-wah with a younger, large, and somewhat inexperienced band.</p>
<p>The initial large band was eventually abandoned in favor of a smaller combo featuring the talents of saxophonist <a href="/wiki/Bill_Evans_%28saxophonist%29.html" title="Bill Evans (saxophonist)">Bill Evans</a> (no relation to the pianist) and a young bass player named <a href="/wiki/Marcus_Miller.html" title="Marcus Miller">Marcus Miller</a>, both of whom would become one of Davis's most regular collaborators throughout the decade. He married Tyson in 1981; they would divorce in 1988. The long-anticipated <i><a href="/wiki/The_Man_With_The_Horn.html" title="The Man With The Horn">The Man With The Horn</a></i> was finally released (<a href="/wiki/1981_in_music.html" title="1981 in music">1981</a>) and received a poor critical reception despite selling fairly well. In May, the new band played two dates as part of the <a href="/wiki/Newport_Jazz_Festival.html" title="Newport Jazz Festival">Newport Jazz Festival</a>, and the concerts, as well as the live recording <i><a href="/wiki/We_Want_Miles.html" title="We Want Miles">We Want Miles</a></i> from the ensuing tour, were well reviewed. Due to ongoing health problems, Davis' performances could still be fairly erratic, but concertgoers found a program with conventional song-based structure (as opposed to the nonstop thematic-based approach of concerts from the end of 1967 to 1975) and on good nights a trumpeter with a vastly expanded range, the result of hours of nonstop practice.</p>
<p>By the time of <i><a href="/wiki/Star_People.html" title="Star People">Star People</a></i> (<a href="/wiki/1983_in_music.html" title="1983 in music">1983</a>), Davis's band included guitarist <a href="/wiki/John_Scofield.html" title="John Scofield">John Scofield</a>, with whom Davis worked closely on both <i>Star People</i> and <a href="/wiki/1984_in_music.html" title="1984 in music">1984</a>'s <i><a href="/wiki/Decoy_%28album%29.html" title="Decoy (album)">Decoy</a></i>, an underdeveloped, experimental mixture of <a href="/wiki/Soul_music.html" title="Soul music">soul music</a> and <a href="/wiki/Electronica.html" title="Electronica">electronica</a>. While much of Davis' records from the period have been described as having an uneven, minimalist feel, this may well have been intentional: by this point he had fallen in love with road work and seemed to consider studio releases as not afterthoughts per se but blueprints for the looser, more organic concerts. With a seven-piece band, including Scofield, Evans, drummer <a href="/wiki/Al_Foster.html" title="Al Foster">Al Foster</a> and bassist <a href="/wiki/Darryl_Jones.html" title="Darryl Jones">Darryl Jones</a> (later of <a href="/wiki/The_Rolling_Stones.html" title="The Rolling Stones">The Rolling Stones</a>), he played a series of European gigs to rapturous receptions. While in Europe, he took part in the recording of <i><a href="/wiki/Aura_%28Miles_Davis_album%29.html" title="Aura (Miles Davis album)">Aura</a></i>, an orchestral tribute to Davis composed by the Danish trumpeter <a href="/wiki/Palle_Mikkelborg.html" title="Palle Mikkelborg">Palle Mikkelborg</a>.</p>
<p>Back in the studio, <i><a href="/wiki/You%27re_Under_Arrest_%28album%29.html" title="You're Under Arrest (album)">You're Under Arrest</a></i> (<a href="/wiki/1985_in_music.html" title="1985 in music">1985</a>) included another stylistic detour: interpretations of contemporary pop songs in <a href="/wiki/Cyndi_Lauper.html" title="Cyndi Lauper">Cyndi Lauper</a>'s "Time After Time" and <a href="/wiki/Michael_Jackson.html" title="Michael Jackson">Michael Jackson</a>'s "Human Nature", for which he would receive much criticism in the jazz press, although the record was otherwise well-reviewed. Davis also noted that many an accepted <a href="/wiki/Jazz_standard.html" title="Jazz standard">jazz standard</a> was in fact a <a href="/wiki/Pop_song.html" title="Pop song">pop song</a> from <a href="/wiki/Broadway_theatre.html" title="Broadway theatre">Broadway theatre</a>, and that he was simply selecting more recent examples of pop songs to perform.</p>
<p><i>You're Under Arrest</i> would also be Davis's final album for Columbia. With the commercial and artistic decline of fusion in the late 70s and early 80s and the disappearance of the genre-breaking Davis, a new wave of traditionalist jazz generally rejecting any advances made in the genre after 1965 emerged to great acclaim amongst those who felt disenfranchised in a sea of fusion and free jazz. The focal point of this movement was trumpeter <a href="/wiki/Wynton_Marsalis.html" title="Wynton Marsalis">Wynton Marsalis</a>, also signed to Columbia, who recorded several albums of classical music in addition to his jazz efforts and publicly dismissed Davis' recent work as not being true "jazz". At first Davis shrugged off Marsalis' comments, referring to him as "a nice young man, only confused", but grew extremely irritated when the latter appeared unannounced on stage during a concert and whispered into Davis' ear that "someone" had told him to do so. He immediately ordered Marsalis to leave the stage. Fans remained divided on the issue: some felt that Marsalis' words had considerable validity, while to others the fact that the brash young trumpeter would frequently insult one whom they considered to be a living legend publicly was nothing short of sacrilege. The breaking point came when a Columbia jazz producer requested that Davis call Marsalis on his birthday. Already irritated with a delay in the release of <i>Aura</i> and Marsalis' mammoth publicity budget, Davis signed with Warner Brothers.</p>
<p>Again demonstrating his eclecticism during this time period, Davis collaborated with a number of figures from the British <a href="/wiki/New_Wave_music.html" title="New Wave music">new wave</a> movement, including <a href="/wiki/Scritti_Politti.html" title="Scritti Politti">Scritti Politti</a>. Davis — at the invitation of producer <a href="/wiki/Bill_Laswell.html" title="Bill Laswell">Bill Laswell</a> — recorded some trumpet parts during sessions for <a href="/wiki/Public_Image_Ltd..html" title="Public Image Ltd.">Public Image Ltd.</a>'s <i><a href="/wiki/Album_%28album%29.html" title="Album (album)">Album</a></i> album, according to Public Image's <a href="/wiki/John_Lydon.html" title="John Lydon">John Lydon</a> in the liner notes of their <i><a  class="new" title="Plastic Box">Plastic Box</a></i> box set, although in Lydon's words, "strangely enough, we didn't use (his contributions)." (Also according to Lydon in the <i>Plastic Box</i> notes, Davis favorably compared Lydon's singing voice to his trumpet sound.)<a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.fodderstompf.com/DISCOGRAPHY/LP/3albumLP.html">[2]</a></p>
<p>Having first taken part in the <a href="/wiki/Artists_United_Against_Apartheid.html" title="Artists United Against Apartheid">Artists United Against Apartheid</a> recording, Davis signed with <a href="/wiki/Warner_Brothers.html" title="Warner Brothers">Warner Brothers</a> records and reunited with <a href="/wiki/Marcus_Miller.html" title="Marcus Miller">Marcus Miller</a>. The resulting record, <i><a href="/wiki/Tutu_%28album%29.html" title="Tutu (album)">Tutu</a></i> (<a href="/wiki/1986_in_music.html" title="1986 in music">1986</a>), would be his first to feature modern studio tools—programmed <a href="/wiki/Synthesizer.html" title="Synthesizer">synthesizers</a>, <a href="/wiki/Sampling_%28music%29.html" title="Sampling (music)">samples</a> and drum loops—to create an entirely new setting for Davis's playing. Ecstatically reviewed on its release, the album would frequently be described as a modern version of the classic <i>Sketches of Spain</i>, and won a <a href="/wiki/Grammy.html" title="Grammy">Grammy</a> award in <a href="/wiki/1987_in_music.html" title="1987 in music">1987</a>.</p>
<p>He followed <i>Tutu</i> with the soundtracks to two movies, <i><a href="/wiki/Street_Smart.html" title="Street Smart">Street Smart</a></i> and <i><a  class="new" title="Siesta (album)">Siesta</a></i>, with neither the films nor Davis's scores being particularly noteworthy (other than <a href="/wiki/Morgan_Freeman.html" title="Morgan Freeman">Morgan Freeman</a>'s celebrated turn as "Fast Black" in <i>Street Smart</i>), but he continued to tour with a band of constantly rotating personnel and a critical stock at a level higher than it had been for fifteen years.</p>
<p>Miles Davis continued to tour and perform regularly through the last years of his life. He died from a <a href="/wiki/Stroke.html" title="Stroke">stroke</a> in <a href="/wiki/September_28.html" title="September 28">September 28</a>, <a href="/wiki/1991.html" title="1991">1991</a> at the age of 65.
