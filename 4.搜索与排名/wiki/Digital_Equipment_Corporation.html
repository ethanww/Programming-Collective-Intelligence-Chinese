<p><b>Digital Equipment Corporation</b> was an <a href="/wiki/United_States.html" title="United States">American</a> pioneering company in the <a href="/wiki/Computer.html" title="Computer">computer</a> industry. It is often referred to within the computing industry as <b>DEC</b>. (This acronym was once officially used by Digital itself, <sup><a href="/wiki/Digital_Equipment_Corporation#References.html" title="Digital Equipment Corporation">[1]</a></sup> but the official name was always DIGITAL.) Its PDP and VAX products were arguably the most popular mini-computers for the scientific and engineering communities during the 70s and 80s. DEC was acquired by <a href="/wiki/Compaq.html" title="Compaq">Compaq</a>, which subsequently merged with <a href="/wiki/Hewlett-Packard.html" title="Hewlett-Packard">Hewlett-Packard</a>. As of <a href="/wiki/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> its product lines were still produced under the HP name. From 1957 until 1992 its headquarters was in an old woolen mill in <a href="/wiki/Maynard%2C_Massachusetts.html" title="Maynard, Massachusetts">Maynard, Massachusetts</a>.</p>
<p>Digital Equipment Corporation should not be confused with <a href="/wiki/Digital_Research.html" title="Digital Research">Digital Research</a>; the two were unrelated, separate entities; or with <a href="/wiki/Western_Digital.html" title="Western Digital">Western Digital</a> (despite the fact that they made the <a href="/wiki/LSI-11.html" title="LSI-11">LSI-11</a> chipsets used in Digital Equipment Corporation's low end <a  class="new" title="PDP-11/03">PDP-11/03</a> computers).

<h2>History</h2>
<p>The company was founded in <a href="/wiki/1957.html" title="1957">1957</a> by <a href="/wiki/Ken_Olsen.html" title="Ken Olsen">Ken Olsen</a> and <a href="/wiki/Harlan_Anderson.html" title="Harlan Anderson">Harlan Anderson</a>, two engineers who had been working at <a href="/wiki/MIT.html" title="MIT">MIT</a> <a href="/wiki/Lincoln_Laboratory.html" title="Lincoln Laboratory">Lincoln Laboratory</a> on the <a href="/wiki/TX-2.html" title="TX-2">TX-2</a> project. The TX-2 was a <a href="/wiki/Transistor.html" title="Transistor">transistor</a>-based computer using the then-huge amount of <b>64K</b> <a href="/wiki/36-bit_word_length.html" title="36-bit word length">36-bit words</a> of <a href="/wiki/Core_memory.html" title="Core memory">core memory</a>. When that project ran into difficulties, Olsen and Anderson left MIT to form DEC. <a href="/wiki/Venture_capital.html" title="Venture capital">Venture capital</a> of about $60,000 was provided by <a href="/wiki/Georges_Doriot.html" title="Georges Doriot">Georges Doriot</a> and his <a  class="new" title="American Research and Development Corporation">American Research and Development Corporation</a>. AR&amp;D later sold its investment in Digital for approximately $450 million, certainly the best VC return ever at the time. At the time the VC market was hostile to computer companies, and investors shied from their plans. The original business plan named the company "Digital Computer Corporation", but AR&amp;D required that the name be changed to DEC. Instead DEC started building small digital "modules" (flip flops, gates, transformer drivers, etc.) that could be combined together to run scientific and engineering experiments. In <a href="/wiki/1959.html" title="1959">1959</a> Ben Gurley started design of their first computer, the <a href="/wiki/PDP-1.html" title="PDP-1">PDP-1</a> (PDP being an initialism for <a href="/wiki/Programmable_Data_Processor.html" title="Programmable Data Processor">Programmable Data Processor</a>).</p>

<p>The first modules were the free-standing "laboratory modules", placing one or two gates inside an extruded aluminum housing. These modules could be stacked up in a pre-configured 19" rack shelf that supplied power to the modules; the logic circuits were then established using <a href="/wiki/4_mm_plug.html" title="4 mm plug">banana plug</a> <a href="/wiki/Patch_cord.html" title="Patch cord">patch cords</a> installed at the front of the modules.

<p>To serve laboratories at a lower cost, DEC provided the <a href="/wiki/Programmed_Data_Processor.html" title="Programmed Data Processor">PDP-5</a>, an early minicomputer in 1963. True success followed with the introduction of the famous <a href="/wiki/PDP-8.html" title="PDP-8">PDP-8</a> in <a href="/wiki/1964.html" title="1964">1964</a>. It was a smaller, 12-bit word machine that sold for about $16,000. The PDP-8 was small enough to fit on a cart. It was simple enough to be used for many roles, and they soon started being sold in huge numbers to new market niches, labs, railways, and all sorts of industrial applications.</p>
<p>The PDP-8 was important historically because it was the first computer that was regularly purchased by a handful of end users as an alternative to using a larger system in a data center. Because of their low cost and portability, these machines could be purchased to fill a specific need, unlike the mainframe systems of the day that were nearly always shared among diverse users. Today the PDP-8 is generally regarded as the first <a href="/wiki/Minicomputer.html" title="Minicomputer">minicomputer</a>. The PDP-8 spawned a cousin, the <a href="/wiki/PDP-12.html" title="PDP-12">PDP-12</a>, which merged data acquisition and display capabilities developed with the NIH-sponsored <a href="/wiki/LINC.html" title="LINC">LINC</a> computers into the PDP-8 architecture.</p>
<p>Many 8 and 16 bit machine architectures are said to be inspired by the PDP-8, including the <a href="/wiki/HP_2100.html" title="HP 2100">HP 2100</a> and <a href="/wiki/Data_General_Nova.html" title="Data General Nova">Data General Nova</a>, and to a lesser extent the <a href="/wiki/National_Semiconductor.html" title="National Semiconductor">National Semiconductor</a> IMP, PACE, and <a href="/wiki/INS8900.html" title="INS8900">INS8900</a> microprocessors and the <a href="/wiki/Signetics_2650.html" title="Signetics 2650">Signetics 2650</a> microprocessor. Machines based on the PDP-8 can be characterized by a small number of accumulators (such as AC and MQ, or A and B), or a small number of general registers (R0-R3) rather than a relatively large number of regular registers (such as R0-R7 or R15), and by memory addressing in terms of a base page and a current page (related to PC value).</p>
<p>The design of the 4 bit <a href="/wiki/Intel_4004.html" title="Intel 4004">Intel 4004</a> was also inspired by the PDP-8, although it has a series of regular registers (R0-R15), because <a href="/wiki/Ted_Hoff.html" title="Ted Hoff">Ted Hoff</a> while evaluating the <a href="/wiki/Busicom.html" title="Busicom">Busicom</a> designed calculator chipset for production by Intel realized that the PDP-8 sitting in the corner of the room was far more powerful than these chips yet the circuitry was much simpler. Therefore he proposed that Intel not make the chips designed by Busicom, but instead design a "computer chipset" for them that they could program as a calculator.</p>

<h3>16-bit systems</h3>
<p><a href="/wiki/Data_General.html" title="Data General">Data General</a> was formed by a group of DEC engineers in May,1968 and rapidly brought the 16 bit NOVA minicomputer to market. DEC immediately found itself behind in the industry transition to 8 bit bytes. The PDP-11 16 bit computer was architected in a crash program by Harold McFarland, Gordon Bell, Roger Cady, and others. Its numerous architectural innovations, including the <a  class="new" title="UNIBUS">UNIBUS</a>, proved superior to all competitors and the "11" architecture was soon the industry leader. The first model was the PDP-11/20 and was followed by higher performance models such as the 11/45 and 11/70. As improvements to <a href="/wiki/Integrated_circuit.html" title="Integrated circuit">integrated circuits</a> enabled the single chip microprocessor, 11's eventually were packaged in cases no larger than a modern <a href="/wiki/Personal_Computer.html" title="Personal Computer">PC</a>.</p>
<p>The PDP-11 systems supported several operating systems, including <a href="/wiki/Bell_Labs.html" title="Bell Labs">Bell Labs'</a> new <a href="/wiki/Unix.html" title="Unix">Unix</a> operating system as well as DEC's <a href="/wiki/RSX-11.html" title="RSX-11">RSX</a> and <a href="/wiki/RSTS/E.html" title="RSTS/E">RSTS</a>. Both RSTS and Unix were available to educational institutions at little or no cost, and these PDP-11 systems were destined to be the sandbox for a generation of engineers and computer scientists. Large numbers of 11/70's were deployed in telecommunications and industrial control applications. AT&amp;T became DEC's largest customer.</p>
<p>The PDP-11's 16-bit, byte-oriented architecture provided a 64KB virtual address space. Most models had a paged physical memory architecture and memory protection features to allow <a href="/wiki/Time-sharing.html" title="Time-sharing">timesharing</a>, and some could support split Instruction &amp; Data spaces for an effective virtual address size of 128KB and a physical address size of up to 4MB.</p>
<p>PDP operating systems were the model for many other operating systems. <a href="/wiki/CP/M.html" title="CP/M">CP/M</a> used a similar command syntax, and even retained the awkward <a href="/wiki/Peripheral_Interchange_Program.html" title="Peripheral Interchange Program">PIP</a> program which was used to copy programs which was dropped in <a href="/wiki/MS-DOS.html" title="MS-DOS">MS-DOS</a> and <a href="/wiki/Windows_NT.html" title="Windows NT">Windows NT</a>, which succeeded <a href="/wiki/CP/M.html" title="CP/M">CP/M</a> and <a href="/wiki/OpenVMS.html" title="OpenVMS">VAX/VMS</a>. The use of switches would lead to the adoption of '\' for pathnames in <a href="/wiki/Microsoft_Windows.html" title="Microsoft Windows">Windows</a> compared to '/' in <a href="/wiki/UNIX.html" title="UNIX">UNIX</a>.</p>

<h3>36-bit systems</h3>
<p>A paper design for the third PDP (PDP-3) was developed, and a single computer was produced from the specification by a DEC customer using DEC System Building Blocks.</p>
<p>For larger scientific problems DEC produced first the PDP-6 in 1964, using a 36-bit architecture.

A representative VAX-11/780 system configuration</div>

</div>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/1976.html" title="1976">1976</a> DEC decided to extend the PDP-11 archtecture to 32 bits, creating the first 32-bit minicomputer which they referred to as a <i><a href="/wiki/Supermini.html" title="Supermini">super-mini</a></i>. This was launched as the <a href="/wiki/VAX.html" title="VAX">VAX</a> (Virtual Address eXtension) 11/780 in <a href="/wiki/1978.html" title="1978">1978</a>, and immediately took over the vast majority of the minicomputer market. Desperate attempts by competitors such as <a href="/wiki/Data_General.html" title="Data General">Data General</a> (which had been formed in <a href="/wiki/1968.html" title="1968">1968</a> by Ed DeCastro and 8 other DEC engineers who had worked on a 16-bit design that DEC had rejected) to win back market share failed, due not only to DEC's successes, but the emergence of the <a href="/wiki/Microcomputer.html" title="Microcomputer">microcomputer</a> and <a href="/wiki/Workstation.html" title="Workstation">workstation</a> into the lower-end of the minicomputer market. In <a href="/wiki/1983.html" title="1983">1983</a>, DEC cancelled their <a href="/wiki/Jupiter_project.html" title="Jupiter project">"Jupiter" project</a>, which had been intended to build a successor to the PDP-10, and instead focused on promoting the VAX as their the single computer architecture for the company. It was believed that microprocessor technology at the low end and networking of larger systems could produce a 1:1000 range of computing power from one architecture.</p>
<p>The VAX series had an instruction set that is rich even by today's standards (as well as an abundance of <a href="/wiki/Addressing_mode.html" title="Addressing mode">addressing modes</a>). In addition to the paging and memory protection features of the PDP series, the VAX supported <a href="/wiki/Virtual_memory.html" title="Virtual memory">virtual memory</a>. The VAX could use both Unix and DEC's own <a href="/wiki/OpenVMS.html" title="OpenVMS">VMS</a> operating system.</p>
<p>At its peak in the late <a href="/wiki/1980s.html" title="1980s">1980s</a>, Digital was the second-largest computer company in the world, with over 100,000 employees. It was during this time that they appeared to gain a feeling of invincibility, and branched out into software, producing products for almost every then "hot" niche. This included their own networking system, <a href="/wiki/DECnet.html" title="DECnet">DECnet</a>, file and print sharing, relational database, and even <a href="/wiki/Transaction_processing.html" title="Transaction processing">transaction processing</a>. Although many of these products were well designed, most of them were DEC-only or DEC-centric, and customers frequently ignored them and used third party products instead. This problem was further magnified by Olsen's aversion to traditional advertising and his belief that well-engineered products would sell themselves. Hundreds of millions of dollars were spent on these projects, at the same time that workstations based on <a href="/wiki/RISC.html" title="RISC">RISC</a> architecture were starting to approach the VAX in performance. Constrained by their huge success of the VAX/VMS products, which followed the proprietary model, the company was very late to respond to commodity hardware in the form of <a href="/wiki/Intel.html" title="Intel">Intel</a>-based personal computers and standards-based software such as <a href="/wiki/Unix.html" title="Unix">Unix</a> and <a href="/wiki/Internet.html" title="Internet">Internet</a> protocols such as <a href="/wiki/TCP/IP.html" title="TCP/IP">TCP/IP</a>. In the early <a href="/wiki/1990s.html" title="1990s">1990s</a> DEC found its sales faltering, and its first layoffs followed. The company that created the minicomputer and arguably the first computers for personal use did not effectively respond to the significant restructuring of the computer industry.</p>

<p>During the <a href="/wiki/1980s.html" title="1980s">1980s</a> DEC made several attempts at designing a <a href="/wiki/RISC.html" title="RISC">RISC</a> (reduced instruction set) processor to replace the VAX architecture. Eventually, in <a href="/wiki/1992.html" title="1992">1992</a> DEC launched the <a href="/wiki/DEC_Alpha.html" title="DEC Alpha">Alpha</a> processor (initially named <b>Alpha AXP</b>, the "AXP" was later dropped). This was a <a href="/wiki/64-bit.html" title="64-bit">64-bit</a> <a href="/wiki/RISC.html" title="RISC">RISC</a> architecture (as opposed to the 32-bit <a href="/wiki/CISC.html" title="CISC">CISC</a> architecture used in the VAX) and one of the first 64-bit <a href="/wiki/Microprocessor.html" title="Microprocessor">microprocessor</a> designs. The Alpha offered class-leading performance at its launch, and subsequent variants continued to do so into the <a href="/wiki/2000s.html" title="2000s">2000s</a>. Alpha-based computers (the DEC AXP series, later the <a href="/wiki/AlphaStation.html" title="AlphaStation">AlphaStation</a> and <a href="/wiki/AlphaServer.html" title="AlphaServer">AlphaServer</a> series) superseded both the VAX architecture and the <a href="/wiki/MIPS_architecture.html" title="MIPS architecture">MIPS</a>-based <a href="/wiki/DECstation.html" title="DECstation">DECstation</a> line, and could run VMS, DEC's 4.2<a href="/wiki/Berkeley_Software_Distribution.html" title="Berkeley Software Distribution">BSD</a>-based <a href="/wiki/Unix.html" title="Unix">Unix</a> variant called <a href="/wiki/Ultrix.html" title="Ultrix">Ultrix</a> and Microsoft's new server operating system <a href="/wiki/Windows_NT.html" title="Windows NT">Windows NT</a>.</p>
<p>DEC tried to compete in the Unix market by marketing the VMS operating system as "<a href="/wiki/OpenVMS.html" title="OpenVMS">OpenVMS</a>" and by selling their own Unix (<a href="/wiki/OSF/1.html" title="OSF/1">OSF/1 AXP</a>, later renamed Digital UNIX, and even later Tru64), and it began to advertise more aggressively. DEC was simply not prepared to sell into a crowded Unix market however, and furthermore the low end PC-servers running NT (based on <a href="/wiki/Intel.html" title="Intel">Intel</a> processors) took market share from Alpha-based computers. DEC's workstation and server line never gained much popularity beyond former DEC customers.</p>

<h3>Personal computers</h3>
<p>Digital responded to the challenge of the <a href="/wiki/IBM-PC.html" title="IBM-PC">IBM-PC</a> with not one, but three machines, tied to <a href="/wiki/Proprietary.html" title="Proprietary">proprietary</a> architectures. One machine was for "professionals", barely hiding CEO Ken Olsen's contempt for the IBM PC. One was for word processing only, and one was "almost" IBM compatible. All 3 were commercial failures. Packaging was based on the new <a href="/wiki/VT220.html" title="VT220">VT220</a> terminals. The <a  class="new" title="DEC Professional Series Model 350 (380)">DEC Professional Series Model 350 (380)</a> was based on the <a  class="new" title="PDP-11/23 (11/73)">PDP-11/23 (11/73)</a> which, running RSX-11M+ derived the menu-driven P/OS, was software incompatible with the base of largely <a href="/wiki/CP/M.html" title="CP/M">CP/M</a> and <a href="/wiki/8080.html" title="8080">8080</a> based microcomputers. The 'Pro' provided 64K 16-bit addresses windowing into 2 MB of physical memory, compared to 1 MB capacity of the <a href="/wiki/Intel_8086.html" title="Intel 8086">Intel 8086</a>. The <a  class="new" title="DecMate I and II">DecMate I and II</a> was the latest version of the PDP-8 based word processors, but not really suited to general computing, nor competitive with <a href="/wiki/Wang.html" title="Wang">Wang</a> word processing which was becoming popular. The <a href="/wiki/Rainbow_100.html" title="Rainbow 100">Rainbow 100</a> ran an 8086 implementation of <a href="/wiki/CP/M-86.html" title="CP/M-86">CP/M</a>, so applications could in theory be recompiled, but by this time, users were expecting custom-built applications such as <a href="/wiki/Lotus_1-2-3.html" title="Lotus 1-2-3">Lotus 1-2-3</a>, which was eventually ported along with MS-DOS V2.0 and introduced in late 1983. Users objected to having to buy preformatted floppy disks, though this is now commonplace.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/DEC.html" title="DEC">DEC</a> was initially resistant to even supporting <a href="/wiki/MS-DOS.html" title="MS-DOS">MS-DOS</a>, and did not produce a true <a href="/wiki/IBM-PC_compatible.html" title="IBM-PC compatible">IBM-PC compatible</a> computer for many years, though the <a href="/wiki/VAXmate.html" title="VAXmate">VAXmate</a> came close, introduced in 1986 along with <a href="/wiki/MS-Windows.html" title="MS-Windows">MS-Windows</a> V1.0 and a <a href="/wiki/VAX/VMS.html" title="VAX/VMS">VAX/VMS</a> based (file and print) server for Microsoft's network protocols (such as SMB and NetBIOS) along with integration into <a href="/wiki/DEC.html" title="DEC">DEC</a>'s own <a href="/wiki/DECnet.html" title="DECnet">DECnet</a>-family, providing LAN/WAN connection from PC to mainframe (supermini). The lines of DECs personal computers peaked with the Alpha-based 64-bit RISC workstations introduced in the early 90s. DEC later produced a range of true IBM-PC compatible computers, including the Venturis, Celebris and Digital PC desktop lines, the HiNote series of laptops and the Digital Server and Prioris ranges of servers.<a  class="external autonumber" title="http://h18002.www1.hp.com/legacysupport/digital/retired.html">[1]</a></p>

<h3>Closing DEC's business</h3>
<p>In June of 1992, Ken Olsen was replaced by <a href="/wiki/Robert_Palmer_%28computer_businessman%29.html" title="Robert Palmer (computer businessman)">Robert Palmer</a> as the company's CEO. Palmer had joined DEC in 1985 to run Semiconductor Engineering and Manufacturing. His relentless campaign to be CEO and success with the Alpha microprocessor family made him a candidate to succeed Olsen. However, Palmer was unable to stem the tide of red ink. More rounds of layoffs ensued and many of DEC's assets were spun off:</p>
<ul>
<li>Worldwide training was spun off to form an independent/new company called Global Knowledge Network <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.globalknowledge.com">[2]</a>.</li>
<li>Their database product, <a href="/wiki/Oracle_Rdb.html" title="Oracle Rdb">Rdb</a>, was sold to <a href="/wiki/Oracle_Corporation.html" title="Oracle Corporation">Oracle</a>.</li>

<li><a href="/wiki/Text_terminal.html" title="Text terminal">Text terminal</a> business (<a href="/wiki/VT100.html" title="VT100">VT100</a> and its successors) was sold in August 1995 to <a  class="new" title="Boundless Technologies">Boundless Technologies</a>.</li>
<li>In May 1997, DEC sued <a href="/wiki/Intel.html" title="Intel">Intel</a> for allegedly infringing on its Alpha patents in designing the <a href="/wiki/Intel_Pentium.html" title="Intel Pentium">Pentium</a> chips. As part of a settlement, DEC's chip business was sold to Intel. This included DEC's <a href="/wiki/StrongARM.html" title="StrongARM">StrongARM</a> implementation of the <a href="/wiki/ARM_architecture.html" title="ARM architecture">ARM computer architecture</a>, which Intel now sells as the <a href="/wiki/Intel_XScale.html" title="Intel XScale">XScale</a> processors commonly used in <a href="/wiki/Pocket_PC.html" title="Pocket PC">Pocket PCs</a>.</li>
<li>In 1997, the printer business was sold to <a href="/wiki/GENICOM.html" title="GENICOM">GENICOM</a> (now TallyGenicom), which then produced models bearing the Digital logo.</li>
<li>At about the same time, the networking business was sold to <a href="/wiki/Cabletron_Systems.html" title="Cabletron Systems">Cabletron Systems</a>, and subsequently spun off as <a  class="new" title="Digital Network Products Group">Digital Network Products Group</a>.</li>
<li>The <a href="/wiki/DECtalk.html" title="DECtalk">DECtalk</a> and <a  class="new" title="DECvoice">DECvoice</a> voice products were spun off, and eventually arrived at <a  class="new" title="Fonix">Fonix</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Eventually, on <a href="/wiki/January_26.html" title="January 26">January 26</a>, <a href="/wiki/1998.html" title="1998">1998</a>, what remained of the company was sold to <a href="/wiki/Compaq.html" title="Compaq">Compaq</a>.

Hewlett-Packard now sells what were Digital's StorageWorks disk/tape products <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://h18006.www1.hp.com/storage/">[3]</a>, made possible through the Compaq acquisition.</p>
<p>The Digital logo survived for a while after the company ceased to exist, as the logo of Digital GlobalSoft, an IT services company in India (which was a 51% subsidiary of DEC). Digital GlobalSoft was later renamed "HP GlobalSoft" (also known as the "HP Global Delivery India Center" or HP GDIC) and no longer uses the Digital logo nor follows the erstwhile Digital culture of engineering predominance.</p>

<p>The first versions of the <a href="/wiki/C_programming_language.html" title="C programming language">C programming language</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Unix.html" title="Unix">UNIX system</a> ran on Digital's <a href="/wiki/Programmed_Data_Processor.html" title="Programmed Data Processor">PDP</a> series of computers (first on a PDP-7, then the PDP-11's), which were the first commercially viable <a href="/wiki/Minicomputer.html" title="Minicomputer">minicomputers</a>.</p>
<p>Digital also produced the popular <a href="/wiki/VAX.html" title="VAX">VAX</a> computer family, the first pure 64-bit microprocessor architecture, <a href="/wiki/DEC_Alpha.html" title="DEC Alpha">Alpha AXP</a>, the first commercially successful workstation (the VT-78), and some commercially unsuccessful personal computers.</p>
<p>Digital produced top-line operating systems, like <a href="/wiki/OS/8.html" title="OS/8">OS-8</a>, <a href="/wiki/TOPS-10.html" title="TOPS-10">TOPS-10</a>, <a href="/wiki/TOPS-20.html" title="TOPS-20">TOPS-20</a>, <a href="/wiki/RSTS/E.html" title="RSTS/E">RSTS/E</a>, <a href="/wiki/RSX-11.html" title="RSX-11">RSX-11</a>, <a href="/wiki/RT-11.html" title="RT-11">RT-11</a>, and <a href="/wiki/OpenVMS.html" title="OpenVMS">OpenVMS</a>. PDP computers, in particular the <a href="/wiki/PDP-11.html" title="PDP-11">PDP-11</a> model, inspired a generation of programmers and software developers. Some PDP-11 systems more than 25 years old (software and hardware) are still being used (as of <a href="/wiki/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>) to control and monitor factories, transportation systems and nuclear plants. Digital was an early champion of <a href="/wiki/Time-sharing.html" title="Time-sharing">time-sharing</a> systems, as anybody who has used other operating systems like <a href="/wiki/MVS.html" title="MVS">MVS</a> or <a href="/wiki/VM/CMS.html" title="VM/CMS">VM/CMS</a> from <a href="/wiki/IBM.html" title="IBM">IBM</a> can attest.</p>
<p>Digital was to the command-line interface (CLI) what Apple was to the GUI: there was history before and innovation after, but it was Digital's OSes that put it together in a complete and definitive form. The command-line interfaces found in the Digital's OSes, eventually to be codified as <a href="/wiki/DIGITAL_Command_Language.html" title="DIGITAL Command Language">DCL</a>, would look familiar to any user of modern microcomputer CLIs; those used in earlier systems, such as CTSS, IBM's JCL, or Univac's time-sharing systems, would look utterly alien. Many features of the CP/M and MS-DOS CLI show a recognizable family resemblance to Digital's OSes, including command names such as DIR and HELP and the "name-dot-extension" file naming conventions.</p>
<p>VAX and <a href="/wiki/MicroVAX.html" title="MicroVAX">MicroVAX</a> computers (very widespread in the 1980s) running <a href="/wiki/Virtual_Memory_System.html" title="Virtual Memory System">VMS</a> formed one of the most important pre-Internet networks, <a href="/wiki/DECnet.html" title="DECnet">DECnet</a>, which mixed business and research facilities. The <a href="/wiki/DECnet.html" title="DECnet">DECnet</a> protocols formed one of the first peer-to-peer networking standards. Email, file sharing, and distributed collaborative projects existed within the company long before their value was recognized in the market.</p>
<p>Digital, Intel and Xerox were champions of <a href="/wiki/Ethernet.html" title="Ethernet">Ethernet</a>, but Digital is the company that made Ethernet commercially successful. Initially, Ethernet based DECnet and <a href="/wiki/LAT.html" title="LAT">LAT</a> protocols interconnected VAXes with DECserver terminal servers. Starting with the UNIBUS to Ethernet adapter, multiple generations of Ethernet controllers from Digital were the de facto standard. The CI "computer interconnect adapter was the industry's first network interface controller to use separate transmit and receive "rings".</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Computer_cluster.html" title="Computer cluster">Clustering</a>, an operating system technology that treated multiple machines as one logical entity, was invented by Digital. Clustering permitted sharing of pooled disk and tape storage via the HSC50/70/90 and later series of Hierarchical Storage Controllers. HSC's delivered the first hardware RAID 0 and 1 capabilities and the first serial interconnects of multiple storage technologies. This technology was the forerunner to systems like <a href="/wiki/Network_of_Workstations.html" title="Network of Workstations">Network of Workstations</a> which are used for massively cooperative tasks such as web-searches and drug research.</p>
<p>The LA36 and LA120 dot matrix printers became industry standards and lead to the demise of Teletype Corporation.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/VT100.html" title="VT100">VT100</a> <a href="/wiki/Computer_terminal.html" title="Computer terminal">computer terminal</a> became the industry standard, and even today terminal emulators such as <a href="/wiki/HyperTerminal.html" title="HyperTerminal">HyperTerminal</a>, <a href="/wiki/PuTTY.html" title="PuTTY">PuTTY</a> and <a href="/wiki/Xterm.html" title="Xterm">Xterm</a> still emulate a VT100 (though most actually emulate its more capable successor, the <a href="/wiki/VT220.html" title="VT220">VT220</a>).</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/X_Window_System.html" title="X Window System">X Window System</a>, the first remote-windowing system, was developed by <a href="/wiki/Project_Athena.html" title="Project Athena">Project Athena</a> at <a href="/wiki/Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology.html" title="Massachusetts Institute of Technology">MIT</a>. Digital was the primary sponsor for this project.</p>

A rumor circulated for a long time that WNT=VMS+1 (increment each letter by one). Cutler has never directly confirmed this but does not deny it either.</p>
<p>Notes-11 and its follow-on product, VAXnotes, were two of the first examples of online collaboration software, a category that has become to be known as <a href="/wiki/Collaborative_software.html" title="Collaborative software">groupware</a>. <a href="/wiki/Len_Kawell.html" title="Len Kawell">Len Kawell</a>, one of the original Notes-11 developers later joined <a href="/wiki/Lotus_Development_Corporation.html" title="Lotus Development Corporation">Lotus Development Corporation</a> and contributed to their <a href="/wiki/Lotus_Notes.html" title="Lotus Notes">Lotus Notes</a> product.</p>
