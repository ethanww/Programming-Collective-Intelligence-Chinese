<h2>History</h2>
<p>New York University was founded on April 18, 1831 by a group of prominent New Yorkers — the city's landed class of merchants, bankers, and traders — who felt that New York needed a university designed for young men where admission would be based on merit, not birthright or social class. <a href="/wiki/Albert_Gallatin.html" title="Albert Gallatin">Albert Gallatin</a>, Secretary of State under <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson.html" title="Thomas Jefferson">Thomas Jefferson</a>, described his motivation in a letter to a friend: "It appeared to me impossible to preserve our democratic institutions and the right of universal suffrage unless we could raise the standard of general education and the mind of the laboring classes nearer to a level with those born under more favorable circumstances."</p>

<p>To the school's founders, the classical curriculum offered at American colleges needed to be combined with a more modern and practical education. Educators in <a href="/wiki/Paris.html" title="Paris">Paris</a>, <a href="/wiki/Vienna.html" title="Vienna">Vienna</a>, and <a href="/wiki/London.html" title="London">London</a> were beginning to consider a new form of higher learning, where students began to focus not only on the <a href="/wiki/Classics.html" title="Classics">classics</a> and <a href="/wiki/Religion.html" title="Religion">religion</a>, but also <a href="/wiki/Modern_languages.html" title="Modern languages">modern languages</a>, <a href="/wiki/Philosophy.html" title="Philosophy">philosophy</a>, <a href="/wiki/History.html" title="History">history</a>, <a href="/wiki/Political_economy.html" title="Political economy">political economy</a>, <a href="/wiki/Mathematics.html" title="Mathematics">mathematics</a> and <a href="/wiki/Physical_science.html" title="Physical science">physical science</a>, so that students might become merchants, bankers, lawyers, physicians, architects, and engineers. This new school would also be <a href="/wiki/Non-denominational.html" title="Non-denominational">non-denominational</a>, unlike <a href="/wiki/Columbia_University.html" title="Columbia University">Columbia College</a>, which had the support of the <a href="/wiki/Anglican_Communion.html" title="Anglican Communion">Anglican Church</a> and at the time offered a classical education grounded in theology. Such innovations would lead to the modern university which New York University would pioneer. NYU is often, erroneously said to be modeled after the <a href="/wiki/University_of_London.html" title="University of London">University of London</a> despite NYU being founded several years earlier.<a  class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_London#History">[1]</a></p>
<p>New York University would provide education to all qualified young men at a reasonable cost, would abandon the exclusive use of "classical" curriculum, and would be financed privately through the sale of stock. The establishment of a joint stock company was meant to prevent any religious group or denomination from dominating the affairs and management of the institution. It is interesting to note that although the university was designed to be open to all men regardless of background, NYU's early classes were composed almost exclusively of the sons of wealthy, white, <a href="/wiki/Protestant.html" title="Protestant">Protestant</a>, <a href="/wiki/New_York.html" title="New York">New York</a> families.</p>

<p>On April 21, 1831, the new institution was incorporated as the <i>University of the City of New York</i> by the New York State Legislature, though it had been known as <i>New York University</i> since its inception. The school was officially renamed to New York University in 1896. In 1832, NYU held its first classes in rented rooms in four-story Clinton Hall, located near <a href="/wiki/New_York_City_Hall.html" title="New York City Hall">City Hall</a>. In 1835, the <a href="/wiki/NYU_School_of_Law.html" title="NYU School of Law">School of Law</a>, NYU's first professional school, was founded.</p>

The Original University Building on Washington Square East</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Clinton Hall, which sat in the heart of New York's bustling and noisy commercial district, would only be NYU's home for a few years as administrators looked uptown for a more suitable and permanent academic environment. More specifically, they looked towards bucolic Greenwich Village. Land was purchased on the east side of <a href="/wiki/Washington_Square_Park.html" title="Washington Square Park">Washington Square</a> and, in 1833, construction began on the "Old University Building," a grand, Gothic structure that would house all of the school's functions. Two years later, the university community took possession of its permanent home, thus beginning NYU's enduring (and sometimes tumultuous) relationship with the Village.</p>
<p>While NYU has had its <a href="/wiki/Washington_Square.html" title="Washington Square">Washington Square</a> campus since its inception, the University purchased a campus at <a href="/wiki/University_Heights.html" title="University Heights">University Heights</a> in <a href="/wiki/The_Bronx.html" title="The Bronx">the Bronx</a>, as a result of overcrowding on the old campus and the desire to follow New York City's development further uptown. NYU's move to the Bronx took place in 1894, spearheaded by the efforts of Chancellor <a href="/wiki/Henry_Mitchell_MacCracken.html" title="Henry Mitchell MacCracken">Henry Mitchell MacCracken</a>. The University Heights campus was far more spacious than its predecessor, and housed the bulk of the University's operations, along with the undergraduate <a href="/wiki/NYU_College_of_Arts_and_Science.html" title="NYU College of Arts and Science">College of Arts and Science</a> and School of Engineering. With most of NYU's operations moved to the new campus, the <a href="/wiki/Washington_Square.html" title="Washington Square">Washington Square</a> campus declined, with only the Law School remaining until the founding of Washington Square College in 1914. It would become the downtown Arts and Sciences division of the university. In 1900, NYU founded its undergraduate School of Commerce, Accounts and Finance, which eventually became the Leonard N. Stern School of Business, to provide professional training for young people in the business world. NYU's <a href="/wiki/Long_Island.html" title="Long Island">Long Island</a> extension from 1935-1940 became the independent <a href="/wiki/Hofstra_University.html" title="Hofstra University">Hofstra University</a>.<a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bartleby.com/65/ho/HofstraU.html">[2]</a></p>
<p>NYU offered women access to graduate studies in 1888, teaching and law in 1890, undergraduate studies at Washington Square College (then a satellite campus). When women were finally admitted to the University Heights College (which would later become CAS) in 1959 many alumni and male undergraduates were not pleased. The student newspaper remarked upon the instituting of co-education by applying a quote from Mark Twain offered upon subject another subject, “the position undignified, the pleasure momentary and the consequences damnable”.</p>
<p>One early attempt to increase the egalitarian nature of the university failed: in 1871 an attempt to offer free tuition to academically qualifying students backfired. The wealthy, Protestant alumni viewed a free university as a charity institution unfit for their own children to attend and thus the attempt of implementing free tuition was abandoned.</p>
<p>Beginning in the 1920’s, NYU attracted the most talented Jewish students and instructors as they were turned away from Ivy League institutions due to “Jewish quotas” which especially targeted first generation Jewish (and other) immigrants living in New York City for exclusion. While NYU flirted with such quotas, a good portion its students were Jewish during this era. Today the university has representation from all races and creeds and only 10 percent of students are from New York.</p>
<p>In the late 1960s and early 1970s, financial crisis gripped the New York City government and many of the city's institutions, including NYU.<a  class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_New_York_City_%281946-1977%29">[3]</a> Feeling the pressures of imminent bankruptcy, then-President of NYU, <a href="/wiki/James_McNaughton_Hester.html" title="James McNaughton Hester">James McNaughton Hester</a>, negotiated the sale of the University Heights campus to the <a href="/wiki/City_University_of_New_York.html" title="City University of New York">City University of New York</a>, which took place in 1973. While University Heights alumni fought to keep the campus, many suggest that the sale was a "blessing in disguise" as the Uptown campus was losing money and the management of two campuses was financially impossible for NYU. Chancellor Sidney Borowitz said on the matter, "There was so much pressure from Uptown alumni to preserve the Heights that it was only under the threat of possible financial ruin that the campus could be sold. With two campuses, NYU could never have prospered as it has." After the sale of the University Heights campus, University College merged with Washington Square College. NYU's School of Engineering officially merged with <a href="/wiki/Polytechnic_University.html" title="Polytechnic University">Polytechnic University</a> in <a href="/wiki/Brooklyn.html" title="Brooklyn">Brooklyn</a>.<a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nyu.edu/library/bobst/research/arch/test/175/facts8.htm">[4]</a></p>
<p>Beginning in the mid-1980's, NYU became increasingly popular to students from outside of the New York City area. To meet the demand for housing and classroom space, the university began purchasing old office buildings, hotels, and even nightclubs.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a  title="">[1]</a></sup> In the 1980's, NYU launched a billion-dollar campaign which was spent almost entirely to update facilities<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a  title="">[2]</a></sup> under the leadership of President <a href="/wiki/John_Brademas.html" title="John Brademas">John Brademas</a>.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a  title="">[3]</a></sup> In 2003, under the leadership of current President <a href="/wiki/John_Sexton.html" title="John Sexton">John Sexton</a>, the university launched a 2.5-billion dollar campaign for funds to be spent especially on faculty and financial aid resources. <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nyu.edu/alumni/newsletter/0105/campaign.html">[5]</a> NYU continues to provide significantly more financial aid than other elite institutions (including Harvard).<a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.aacrao.org/transcript/index.cfm?fuseaction=show_view&amp;doc_id=2667">[6]</a></p>
<p>NYU's aggressive recruitment of renowned professors has been a large factor in the university's prestige.

<h3>Cultural life</h3>
<p>Washington Square has been a center of cultural life in New York since the early of the 19th century. Artists of the <a href="/wiki/Hudson_River_School.html" title="Hudson River School">Hudson River School</a>, the country's first prominent school of painters, settled around <a href="/wiki/Washington_Square.html" title="Washington Square">Washington Square</a> at that time. <a href="/wiki/Samuel_F.B._Morse.html" title="Samuel F.B. Morse">Samuel F.B. Morse</a> and <a href="/wiki/Daniel_Huntington.html" title="Daniel Huntington">Daniel Huntington</a> were tenants of the Old University Building. (The university rented out studio space and residential apartments within the "academic" building.) <a href="/wiki/Edgar_Allan_Poe.html" title="Edgar Allan Poe">Edgar Allan Poe</a>, <a href="/wiki/Mark_Twain.html" title="Mark Twain">Mark Twain</a>, <a href="/wiki/Herman_Melville.html" title="Herman Melville">Herman Melville</a> and <a href="/wiki/Walt_Whitman.html" title="Walt Whitman">Walt Whitman</a> contributed to the artistic climate, having notable interaction with the cultural and academic life of the university.</p>
<p>In the 1870s, sculptors <a href="/wiki/Augustus_Saint-Gaudens.html" title="Augustus Saint-Gaudens">Augustus Saint-Gaudens</a> and <a href="/wiki/Daniel_Chester_French.html" title="Daniel Chester French">Daniel Chester French</a> lived and worked near the Square. By the 1920s, the <a href="/wiki/Washington_Square_Park.html" title="Washington Square Park">Washington Square Park</a> area was nationally recognized as a center for artistic and moral rebellion. Notable residents of that time include <a href="/wiki/Eugene_O%27Neill.html" title="Eugene O'Neill">Eugene O'Neill</a>, <a href="/wiki/John_French_Sloan.html" title="John French Sloan">John Sloan</a> and <a href="/wiki/Maurice_Prendergast.html" title="Maurice Prendergast">Maurice Prendergast</a>. In the 1930s, the abstract expressionists <a href="/wiki/Jackson_Pollock.html" title="Jackson Pollock">Jackson Pollock</a> and <a href="/wiki/Willem_de_Kooning.html" title="Willem de Kooning">Willem de Kooning</a> as well as the realists <a href="/wiki/Edward_Hopper.html" title="Edward Hopper">Edward Hopper</a> and <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Hart_Benton_%28painter%29.html" title="Thomas Hart Benton (painter)">Thomas Hart Benton</a> had studios around Washington Square or the Village. From the 1960s on, Washington Square and the Village became one of the centers of the beat and folk generation, when <a href="/wiki/Allen_Ginsberg.html" title="Allen Ginsberg">Allen Ginsberg</a> and <a href="/wiki/Bob_Dylan.html" title="Bob Dylan">Bob Dylan</a> settled there.</p>
<p>During the era that the University Heights campus served as the main campus, an apparent rift developed with some organizations distancing themselves from students from the downtown schools. The exclusive "Philomathean Society" operated from 1832 to 1888 (formally giving way in 1907 and reconstituted into the Andiron Club. <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://dlib.nyu.edu:8083/archead/servlet/SaxonServlet?source=philomathean.xml&amp;style=saxon01a2002.xsl">[10]</a> Included among the Andiron's regulations was “Rule No.11: Have no relations save the most casual and informal kind with the downtown schools.” The Andiron may or may not have passed into abeyance in 1988. The Eucleian Society, (as a rival to the former Philomathean Society), was founded in 1882 or 1833 and appears to have dissolved several times only to be reformed and is currently extant.</p>
<p>Fraternities (like <a href="/wiki/Zeta_Psi.html" title="Zeta Psi">Zeta Psi</a>, founded at NYU in 1847 and <a href="/wiki/Delta_Phi.html" title="Delta Phi">Delta Phi</a>, in 1841) were also popular in the late nineteenth century. The first fraternities at NYU were social ones, later groups sought to attract students with their athletic, professional, intellectual, and service activities. Students also formed other groups. The Knights of the Lamp was a social organization founded in 1914 at the School of Commerce. It met every full moon and had the glowworm as its mascot. <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nyu.edu/library/bobst/research/arch/thenandnow/leisure.html">[11]</a> The first university year-book was formed by fraternities and "<a href="/wiki/Secret_societies.html" title="Secret societies">secret societies</a>" at the university. <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nyu.edu/library/bobst/research/arch/test/175/pages/year.htm">[12]</a> Clubs today fill interests from cultural heritage to business to politics to Victorian studies. Fraternity membership has peaked and fallen from decade to decade: according to the Office of Fraternity and Sorority Life <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nyu.edu/parents.guide/stu-act-frat.html">[13]</a>, there are currently 25 fraternities and sororities at NYU. There is also fraternity housing on campus (or if you prefer, in the Village.)</p>
<p>A major new addition to NYU's and Washington Square's cultural life is the Jack H. Skirball Center for the Performing Arts, a professionally-operated and programmed 850-seat proscenium theater that opened in October 2003. Presentations there have included the Abbey Theater of Dublin's Playboy of the Western World, the world premiere of Mabou Mines Red Beads, a series of concerts by World Music Institute and a series of first-rate dance companies, including Lar Lubovitch and Bill T. Jones.</p>

Ten per cent of students come from one of New York City's <a href="/wiki/The_five_boroughs.html" title="The five boroughs">five boroughs</a>, and 20% come from the surrounding 17 counties.

<p>As the number of applicants has increased the admissions has become more competitive than ever.

<p>NYU's aggressive recruitment of renowned professors and high-potential graduates has been a large factor in the University's growing prestige. It has often been involved in bidding wars to lure top faculty in an attempt to consistently improve the academic environment. NYU is remarkable in that it went from near-insolvency to becoming one of the country's most prestigious research universities, in large part due to the fact that, instead of building its endowment, the University spent its money on building new facilities and hiring more faculty.</p>

<p>Since the late 1970s, the center of NYU is its <a href="/wiki/Washington_Square_Park.html" title="Washington Square Park">Washington Square</a> <a  class="external text" title="http://www.nyu.edu/about/virtual.html">campus</a> in the heart of <a href="/wiki/Greenwich_Village.html" title="Greenwich Village">Greenwich Village</a>. While there is no fence (and no particular need for one) enclosing the academic buildings around Washington Square, the area is considered NYU's main campus. Every year it holds its commencement (graduation) ceremonies in Washington Square Park. A number of lesser important university events also occur in "the Square". Surrounding is one of the city's most creative and energetic communities, the Village is a historic neighborhood that has attracted generations of writers, musicians, artists, and intellectuals. Today, Greenwich village is one of the toniest areas in New York City, and home to many young professionals.</p>
<p>Notable facilities on <a href="/wiki/Washington_Square_Park.html" title="Washington Square Park">Washington Square</a> are the <a href="/wiki/Elmer_Holmes_Bobst_Library.html" title="Elmer Holmes Bobst Library">Elmer Holmes Bobst Library</a>, designed by <a href="/wiki/Philip_Johnson.html" title="Philip Johnson">Philip Johnson</a> and <a href="/wiki/Richard_Foster.html" title="Richard Foster">Richard Foster</a>, who also designed several other structures, such as Tisch Hall, Meyer Hall and the Hagop Kevorkian Center. Historic landmark buildings include the <a href="/wiki/Silver_Center.html" title="Silver Center">Silver Center</a> (formerly known as "Main building"), Brown Building (formerly called the "Asch building", site of the enormously tragic <a href="/wiki/Triangle_Shirtwaist_Factory_fire.html" title="Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire">Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire</a>), Judson Hall, which houses the <a href="/wiki/Juan_Carlos_I_of_Spain.html" title="Juan Carlos I of Spain">King Juan Carlos I of Spain</a> Center <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nyu.edu/pages/kjc/flash.php">[18]</a>, Vanderbilt Hall, the historic townhouse row on <a href="/wiki/Washington_Square_North.html" title="Washington Square North">Washington Square North</a>, the Kaufman Management Center and the <a href="/wiki/Torch_Club.html" title="Torch Club">Torch Club</a>, (the NYU dining and club facility for alumni, faculty and administrators).

<p>In the 1990s, NYU became a "Two Square" university by building up a second community around <a href="/wiki/Union_Square_%28New_York_City%29.html" title="Union Square (New York City)">Union Square</a>, which is about a ten minute walk from Washington Square. NYU's Union Square community consists of the upper classmen residence halls of Carlyle Court, Palladium Residence Hall, Alumni Hall, Coral Towers, Thirteenth Street Hall, and Third North Residence Hall. The Union Square area has countless upscale restaurants, lounges, bars, <a href="/wiki/Barnes_and_Noble.html" title="Barnes and Noble">Barnes and Noble</a> "flagship superstore" (the chain was founded and is still owned by NYU alumnus <a href="/wiki/Leonard_Riggio.html" title="Leonard Riggio">Leonard Riggio</a>), the famous <a href="/wiki/Strand_Book_Store.html" title="Strand Book Store">Strand Book Store</a> and markets such as <a href="/wiki/Whole_Foods.html" title="Whole Foods">Whole Foods</a> and a new <a href="/wiki/Trader_Joe%27s.html" title="Trader Joe's">Trader Joe's</a>.</p>

<h4>NYU theaters and clubs</h4>
<p>NYU operates a number of theaters and performance facilities which are frequently used by the university's <a href="/wiki/Steinhardt_School_of_Education.html" title="Steinhardt School of Education">music conservatory</a> and <a href="/wiki/Tisch_School_of_the_Arts.html" title="Tisch School of the Arts">Tisch School of the Arts</a> but also external productions. All productions are generally open to the public. The largest performance spaces at NYU are the <a  class="new" title="Skirball Center for the Performing Arts">Skirball Center for the Performing Arts</a> (850 seats) at 566 LaGuardia Place, just south of Washington Square South, and the Eisner-Lubin Auditorium (560 seats) in the Kimmel Center.

Of fame is also NYU's Provincetown Playhouse on MacDougal Street, where Eugene O'Neill among many others launched his career and the Frederick Loewe Theatre. Catalyst to many careers in music (<a href="/wiki/Bruce_Springsteen.html" title="Bruce Springsteen">Bruce Springsteen</a> started here among many others) was the famous nightclub The Bottom Line located on the corner of West 4th and Mercer Streets. Despite the protest of the music scene and many fans, the club was evicted by NYU after being unable to meet the increased rent payments for several months.</p>

<h4>Bobst Library</h4>
<p>The Elmer Holmes Bobst Library, built between 1967 and 1972, is the largest library at New York University and one of the largest academic libraries in the United States. Designed by <a href="/wiki/Philip_Johnson.html" title="Philip Johnson">Philip Johnson</a> and <a href="/wiki/Richard_Foster.html" title="Richard Foster">Richard Foster</a>, the 12 story, 39,000 m² (425,000 square feet) structure sits on the southern edge of Washington Square Park and is the flagship of an eight-library, 4.5 million volume system that provides students and faculty members with access to the world's scholarship and serves as a center for the University community's intellectual life. Bobst Library houses more than 3.3 million volumes, 20 thousand journals, and over 3.5 million microforms; and provides access to thousands of electronic resources both on-site and to the NYU community around the world via the Internet. The Library is visited by more than 6,500 users per day, and circulates almost one million books annually. <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://afghanistandl.nyu.edu/about/library.html">[19]</a> In addition to its regular collection it houses a number of special collections and archives, including the Archives of Irish America and the <a href="/wiki/Tamiment_Library_and_Robert_F._Wagner_Archives.html" title="Tamiment Library and Robert F. Wagner Archives">Tamiment Library and Robert F. Wagner Archives</a>.</p>
<p>The floor of the library, when viewed from above, was designed to appear three dimensional. In late 2003, Bobst Library was the site of several suicides. Two students jumped from the open air crosswalks inside the library, crashing to the marble floor below. Both later died from their injuries.<a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nyusuicides.com/mediaclips005.html">[20]</a> After the second suicide, NYU installed glass windows on each level to prevent further jumping. In 2003, Bobst Library was also in the news for being the home of a <a href="/wiki/Bobst_Boy.html" title="Bobst Boy">homeless student</a> who took permanent residence at the Library since he could not afford student housing.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a  title="">[10]</a></sup>, <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/3665885.stm">[21]</a> When these circumstances came to the attention of administrators the school provided the student with free housing.</p>

<h4>Washington Square Arch</h4>
<p>Despite being public property, the Washington Square Arch is the unofficial symbol of NYU, expanding the 5th avenue axis into <a href="/wiki/Washington_Square_Park.html" title="Washington Square Park">Washington Square Park</a>. The arch was designed by Stanford White in 1889 to commemorate the centennial of George Washington's inauguration in New York City. Originally of wood and papier mache, it was rebuilt as a massive marble and concrete structure from 1890-1895. Today, thousands of NYU graduates march through the arch into Washington Square park to participate in the annual commencement exercises. The arch was renovated in a $2.7-million restoration project from 2002-2004.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a  title="">[11]</a></sup></p>

<h5>Kimmel Center for University Life</h5>
<p>The Kimmel Center for University Life gives students, faculty, alumni, and staff at NYU the space to come together as a community for major events, ceremonies formal and informal, and artistic performances of all kinds. Named for benefactors Helen and Martin Kimmel, the center also houses the Skirball Center for the Performing Arts, the Rosenthal Pavilion, the Eisner &amp; Lubin Auditorium, and the Loeb Student Center. The Kimmel Center is known for lighting up Washington Square at night, as the lights in the building are never turned off. Annually, the electricity bill for the Kimmel Center for University Life tops $1,000,000.</p>

<h5>Furman Hall</h5>
<p>Furman Hall was named after NYU Law alumnus Jay Furman (JD '71). It includes classroom space, student meeting areas, the Law School clinical program, faculty and administrative offices, and faculty residences. The new building is located on West Third Street between Sullivan and Thompson streets, south of Washington Square Park. It totals 170,000 gross square feet. The building’s architect is Kohn Pederson Fox Associates PC. NYU worked closely with the Greenwich Village community to integrate the new building into surrounding architecture. Reconstructed elements of two historic buildings were incorporated into the new facade, one of which was occupied by poet <a href="/wiki/Edgar_Allan_Poe.html" title="Edgar Allan Poe">Edgar Allan Poe</a>.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a  title="">[12]</a></sup></p>

<p>In 2005, NYU announced the development of a new life science facility on Waverly Place. The facility will house laboratories and related academic space for the life sciences and will be the first NYU science building developed since the opening of Meyer Hall in 1971. The new facility will be created through the renovation of three existing buildings at 12 - 16 Waverly Place whilst preserving the original, existing facades.<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a  title="">[13]</a></sup></p>

<h5>E. 12th Street Residence Hall</h5>
<p>In November 2005, NYU announced plans to build a 26 floor, 190,000 square foot residence hall on 12th Street. The residence hall is expected to house about 700 undergraduates and contain a host of other student facilities. It is to be the tallest building in the <a href="/wiki/East_Village.html" title="East Village">East Village</a>.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a  title="">[14]</a></sup> This has caused quite a stir among East Village and New York residents, as the new building would be built over the old St. Ann's Church.<a  class="external autonumber" title="http://villagevoice.com/news/0610,lombardi,72426,2.html">[22]</a></p>

<h3>Medical and other campuses</h3>
<p>The main NYU Medical Campus is located at the East River water front at 1st Ave. between 30th and 34th street. The campus hosts the Medical School, Tisch Hospital and the Rusk Institute of Rehabilitation Medicine. Other NYU Centers across the city include NYU Hospital for Joint Diseases and the Bellevue Hospital Center. NYU's Ehrenkranz School of Social Work operates branch campus programs in Westchester County at <a href="/wiki/Manhattanville_College.html" title="Manhattanville College">Manhattanville College</a> and in Rockland County at <a href="/wiki/St._Thomas_Aquinas_College.html" title="St. Thomas Aquinas College">St. Thomas Aquinas College</a>. NYU maintains a research facility in Sterling Forest, near Tuxedo, New York, which houses several institutes, notably the Nelson Institute of Environmental Medicine. The Midtown Center at 11 West 42nd Street and the <a href="/wiki/Woolworth_Building.html" title="Woolworth Building">Woolworth Building</a> in the financial district are home to NYU's continuing education programs.</p>

<p>NYU has an extensive study abroad program which a good portion of the student body participates in and the school has earned the nickname "Global U". Unlike most other universities, NYU maintains its own international facilities in several countries. Most notable is the 57-acre campus of NYU Florence at <a href="/wiki/Villa_LaPietra.html" title="Villa LaPietra">Villa LaPietra</a> in Italy, bequeathed by the late Sir <a href="/wiki/Harold_Acton.html" title="Harold Acton">Harold Acton</a> to NYU in 1994.<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a  title="">[15]</a></sup> NYU also has its own facilities in London, Paris, Prague, Berlin, Ghana, and Madrid, and recently started a program in Shanghai.</p>

<p>NYU Residence halls are unique in that many are converted <a href="/wiki/Apartment.html" title="Apartment">apartment</a> complexes or old <a href="/wiki/Hotels.html" title="Hotels">hotels</a>. Freshman residence halls are in the Washington Square area. While nearly all of the upper classmen dorms are in the Union Square area, a few are as far as the financial district. (Among some interning upper classmen this proves to be a benefit.) Until the Spring 2005 semester, NYU utilized a lottery system to determine eligibility for residence hall preference. Under this system, a student received one point for every semester they had lived in campus housing. Freshmen are exempted from the lottery system and are traditionally placed in the halls closest to the main campus area. Therefore, historically most of the students who lived in dorms located off-campus were sophomores. However, beginning in the Fall 2006 semester, sophomores will also receive priority housing, giving them first choice of residence halls. The university operates its own transit system to transport these students, via <a href="/wiki/Bus.html" title="Bus">bus</a> or trolley, to campus. Undergraduate students are guaranteed housing for the duration of their tenure at NYU.</p>
<p>There are currently twenty-one buildings in the New York University undergraduate housing community. NYU residence halls receive favorable ratings overall, and some are downright luxurious. Many rooms are spacious, and contain amenities considered rare for individual college residence hall rooms such as kitchens and living rooms/common areas. All residence halls are staffed by 24 hour security staff, contain multiple <a href="/wiki/Resident_assistant.html" title="Resident assistant">resident assistants</a> (RAs), and several halls contain faculty in residence. Unlike many other universities, NYU rooms all have their own bathrooms and thus there are no common bathrooms. Many residence halls have their own dining hall, and the university has meal options to suit various diets. Almost all of the residence halls have a <a href="/wiki/Laundry.html" title="Laundry">laundry</a> room that is open to resident students twenty-four hours a day. The price of using these facilities varies from hall to hall, due to the fact that some halls are leased and NYU can not control the laundry prices.</p>
<p>All of the residence halls are governed by the <a href="/wiki/Residence_Hall_Association.html" title="Residence Hall Association">Inter-Residence Hall Council</a> (IRHC), which is an umbrella student council organization. Each hall elects student representatives to the IRHC, and these representatives meet with one another to form committees and vote on an executive board. The goal of this group is to create programs for university students and to act as a liaison to university administration.</p>

<h2>Student life</h2>
<p>NYU's location in <a href="/wiki/Greenwich_Village.html" title="Greenwich Village">Greenwich Village</a> — a vibrant and creative neighborhood that has attracted generations of artists, writers, intellectuals, and musicians — provides a unique perspective in which to study. NYU's "campus" is a patchwork of buildings and structures across much of the Village making the campus truly an "urban university" that has embraced the city as an essential element of the academic experience. NYU is largely a reflection of the population of New York City, having a mostly progressive and liberal-minded student body.<a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.answers.com/topic/new-york-university">[23]</a> Admissions are need blind and over 70% of students receive some financial aid and there is significant racial, cultural, and religious diversity.<a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nyu.edu/financial.aid/financingalt.pdf">[24]</a></p>
<p>The vast majority of students live in the Greenwhich Village neighborhood in residence halls thus forming an enclave within the larger city.<a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.law.nyu.edu/depts/housing/oncampus/">[25]</a></p>
<p>In 2004, NYU unveiled its new Kimmel Center for University Life, on the south side of Washington Square, which includes a 1,022-seat performing arts center (the Skirball Center for Performing Arts), space for student clubs and activity programming, and student lounges.<a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.osa.nyu.edu/content/newclubdevelopment.php">[26]</a></p>
<p>NYU prides itself on being conducive to any students wishing to create their own sense of environment within the thriving campus activities. NYU's policy of needing only four members to constitute a club makes this a popular trend among today's students. <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.osa.nyu.edu/content/newclubdevelopment.php">[27]</a> Aside from the sports teams, fraternities, sororities, and clubs that focus on fields of study, some of the most visible on-campus organizations are those of the print media clubs, such as the <a href="/wiki/Washington_Square_News.html" title="Washington Square News">Washington Square News</a>, comedy magazine <a  class="new" title="The PLAGUE">The PLAGUE</a> and the literary journals <a  class="new" title="Washington Square Review">Washington Square Review</a> and <a  class="new" title="The Minetta Review">The Minetta Review</a>.</p>

<p>NYU competed in Division I athletics very successfully, exemplified by a great list of athletes who are honored in the Hall of Fame.<a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nyu.edu/athletics/hof/news.html">[29]</a> Almost all sporting teams have participated in the <a href="/wiki/National_Collegiate_Athletic_Association.html" title="National Collegiate Athletic Association">NCAA</a>'s <a href="/wiki/Division_III.html" title="Division III">Division III</a> and the <a href="/wiki/University_Athletic_Association.html" title="University Athletic Association">University Athletic Association</a> since NYU left Divivision I athletics in 1981 at the urging of then president Dr. L.

The <a href="/wiki/Fencing.html" title="Fencing">fencing</a> team also competes in Division I, and is considered one of the best teams in the nation. The National Intercollegiate Women's Fencing Association (NIWFA) was founded by NYU freshmen Julia Jones and Dorothy Hafner.</p>
<p>While NYU has had many All American football players, (most notable among them Hall of Famer <a href="/wiki/Ken_Strong.html" title="Ken Strong">Ken Strong</a>), NYU has not had a varsity <a href="/wiki/American_football.html" title="American football">football</a> team since the 1970s. Several valiant but ill fated attempts have been made to resuscitate football at NYU at club level, both as an intramural activity and intercollegiate sport. In the 70's NYU participated with Georgetown in NYU's first attempt to play non-division I football, suffering a humiliating defeat which revived Georgetown football but spelled doom for NYU. <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.hoyasaxa.com/sports/hist08.htm">[30]</a> The same fate was met after club "competitions" with Fordham almost two decades later. <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nyu.edu/library/bobst/research/arch/175/pages/footb.htm">[31]</a> As recently as 2003 several students created a football club but struggled to find extra funding to defray expenses, find fans or reliable participants for practices and games (held at the surprisingly convenient) <a href="/wiki/East_River_Park.html" title="East River Park">East River Park</a> football fields at 6th and FDR.) <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nyu.edu/clubs/dphi/documents/flyers/ball0803">[32]</a> New efforts may be underway in the fall of 2006.</p>
<p>Intercollegeiate sports at NYU have had moments of importance beyond anything suggested by a scoreboard. In the 1940 season, prior to the NYU vs. <a href="/wiki/University_of_Missouri.html" title="University of Missouri">University of Missouri</a> football game, students protested against the "gentlemen’s agreement" to hold out Black athletes (at Missouri’s request); this is the first time such a protest against this practice was recorded to have occurred. <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.exploratorium.edu/origins/coldspring/dispatch/witkin.html">[33]</a></p>
<p>In 1951 NYU was brushed by the scandal that swept the elite teams of college basketball, of which NYU was one of at the time.<a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.infoplease.com/ipsa/A0747412.html">[34]</a> Adolf Rupp, the noted coach of the University of Kentucky, remarked after the scandal that it was confined to "Jews and niggers and New York". He added that "gamblers couldn't touch his players with a 10-foot pole". <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bigbluehistory.net/bb/nit.html">[35]</a> Several weeks later two his players were caught participating in the game fixing scams.<a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.sportslawnews.com/archive/history/HT5.html">[36]</a></p>
<p>NYU’s rival, as dictated by history and geography has been <a href="/wiki/Columbia_University.html" title="Columbia University">Columbia University</a>, though it appears from older fight songs, that Rutgers also filled that role at some juncture. Currently the athletic intra-conference <a href="/wiki/University_Athletic_Association.html" title="University Athletic Association">University Athletic Association</a>, <a href="/wiki/University_of_Chicago.html" title="University of Chicago">University of Chicago</a> serves as a rival of sorts.</p>

<li>There are two versions of the origin of the university color, <i>violet</i>.

<li>The NYU Victory, a US Navy Cargo Ship, launched May 16, 1945, was named for NYU</li>
<li>A mock revolution was held atop Washington Square Arch in 1916. One night, Gertrude Drick, John Sloan, Marcel Duchamp, and five other friends ascended the interior stairway to emerge on top of the arch. There, they announced the secession of Greenwich Village from the Union, stating that it would henceforth be known as the “Free and Independent Republic of Washington Square.”</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Def_Jam.html" title="Def Jam">Def Jam</a> Records co-founder, <a href="/wiki/Rick_Rubin.html" title="Rick Rubin">Rick Rubin</a> is an NYU graduate who founded the company from his dorm room as a precocious undergrad.</li>
<li>Since 1885, the most spirited undergraduate class has been awarded “The Bun.” The award consisted of a bun enclosed in a silver casket. The phrase “You take the bun,” parallels the more modern saying, “You take the cake,” thus the name. Taken three times in 1921, 1971, and 1981, the Bun was last returned in 2002 and now resides in the Silver Center.</li>

<h2>Traditions</h2>
<p>Below are a few of the many student traditions of New York University:</p>
<ul>
<li>During the First Week of Classes: Since 1900, a series of initiation ceremonies have welcomed entering NYU students. At the Bronx University Heights Campus, seniors grabbed unsuspecting freshmen and led them to an early 19th century horse-watering trough. The seniors dunked the freshmen headfirst into what became known as “the fountain of knowledge.” This practice lasted until the 1970s. Today freshman cool off in Washington Square Park during the initial week of classes- voluntarily, often with upper classmen "overseeing" and participating.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>During the First Week of Classes: The Rope Tug of War began between School of Commerce (now Stern) Freshmen and Sophomores (often with “aid” from upper classmen and graduate students.)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Apple Fest, October: What’s the best part about spending autumn in the Big Apple? Apple Fest of course! Featuring the whole country get-up, including hay bales, pumpkins, cider, games, contests, prizes, arts &amp; crafts, live music and of course, lots of apples. An ageless country fest that once occurred in the then semi-rural University Heights Campus.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Harvest Dinner, November: The Harvest Dinner is the annual fall banquet for graduate students featuring a distinguished speaker. Another one of the old country fests.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Winter Fest, February: The Winter Fest is aldo held in Washington Square. Winter Fest celebrates this chilly time of year featuring winter lights, an array of food, music of all sorts, winter games and activities.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Strawberry Fest, April: A tradition for decades, this festival gathers students, staff and faculty in celebration of wellness, community, and of course, strawberries. This street fair includes carnival games, and allegedly the longest strawberry shortcake.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Midnight Breakfast: An exam time ritual where free midnight dinner is offered (at Weinstein and Palladium) consisting of breakfast foods, presumably to increase student time-disorientation during such periods of all night study.</li>
