<h3>Early life</h3>
<p>Horatio Nelson was born on <a href="/wiki/September_29.html" title="September 29">29 September</a> <a href="/wiki/1758.html" title="1758">1758</a> in a rectory in <a href="/wiki/Burnham_Thorpe.html" title="Burnham Thorpe">Burnham Thorpe</a>, <a href="/wiki/Norfolk.html" title="Norfolk">Norfolk</a>, the sixth of eleven children of <a  class="new" title="Edmund Nelson">The Revd Edmund Nelson</a> and <a href="/wiki/Catherine_Suckling.html" title="Catherine Suckling">Catherine Nelson</a>. His mother, who died when he was nine, was a grandniece of Sir <a href="/wiki/Robert_Walpole%2C_1st_Earl_of_Orford.html" title="Robert Walpole, 1st Earl of Orford">Robert Walpole, 1st Earl of Orford</a>, the <i>de facto</i> first <a href="/wiki/Prime_minister.html" title="Prime minister">prime minister</a> of the British Parliament.</p>
<p>Nelson learned to sail on <a href="/wiki/Barton_Broad.html" title="Barton Broad">Barton Broad</a> on the <a href="/wiki/Norfolk_Broads.html" title="Norfolk Broads">Norfolk Broads</a>. He was briefly educated at <a href="/wiki/Paston_Grammar_School.html" title="Paston Grammar School">Paston Grammar School</a>, <a href="/wiki/North_Walsham.html" title="North Walsham">North Walsham</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Norwich_School.html" title="Norwich School">Norwich School</a>, and by the time he was twelve he had enrolled in the <a href="/wiki/Royal_Navy.html" title="Royal Navy">Royal Navy</a>. His naval career began on <a href="/wiki/January_1.html" title="January 1">1 January</a> <a href="/wiki/1771.html" title="1771">1771</a> when he reported to the <a href="/wiki/Third-rate.html" title="Third-rate">third-rate</a> <a  class="new" title="HMS Raisonnable (1768)"><i>Raisonnable</i></a> as an <a href="/wiki/Ordinary_Seaman.html" title="Ordinary Seaman">ordinary seaman</a> and <a href="/wiki/Coxswain.html" title="Coxswain">coxswain</a>. Nelson’s maternal uncle, Captain <a href="/wiki/Maurice_Suckling.html" title="Maurice Suckling">Maurice Suckling</a>, commanded the vessel. Shortly after reporting aboard, Nelson was appointed a <a href="/wiki/Midshipman.html" title="Midshipman">midshipman</a> and began officer training. Ironically, Nelson found that he suffered from <a href="/wiki/Seasickness.html" title="Seasickness">seasickness</a>, a chronic complaint that dogged him for the rest of his life.</p>

</div>
<p>Suckling became Comptroller of the Navy in 1775 and used his position to help Nelson's rapid advance. By 1777 Nelson had risen to the rank of <a href="/wiki/Lieutenant.html" title="Lieutenant">lieutenant</a> and was assigned to the <a href="/wiki/West_Indies.html" title="West Indies">West Indies</a>. During his service as lieutenant he saw action on the British side in the <a href="/wiki/American_Revolutionary_War.html" title="American Revolutionary War">American Revolutionary War</a>. By the time he was 20, in June 1779, he was made post. The 28-gun frigate <a  class="new" title="HMS Hinchinbroke (1779)"><i>Hinchinbroke</i></a>, newly captured from the French, was his first command as <a href="/wiki/Post-captain.html" title="Post-captain">post-captain</a>.</p>
<p>In 1780 he was involved in an <a href="/wiki/West_Indies_and_Gulf_Coast_campaigns#San_Juan_expedition.2C_1780.html" title="West Indies and Gulf Coast campaigns">action against the Spanish</a> fortress of San Juan in <a href="/wiki/Nicaragua.html" title="Nicaragua">Nicaragua</a>. Though the expedition was ultimately a major debacle, none of the blame was attributed to Nelson, who was praised for his efforts. He fell seriously ill, probably contracting <a href="/wiki/Malaria.html" title="Malaria">malaria</a>, and returned to England for more than a year to recover. He eventually returned to active duty and was assigned to <a  class="new" title="HMS Albemarle (1779)"><i>Albemarle</i></a>, in which he continued his efforts against the American rebels until the official end of the war in 1783.</p>

<p><a name="Command" id="Command"></a></p>
<h3>Command</h3>
<p>In 1784 Nelson was given command of the frigate <i>Boreas</i>, and assigned to enforce the <a href="/wiki/1651_Navigation_Act.html" title="1651 Navigation Act">Navigation Act</a> in the vicinity of <a href="/wiki/Antigua.html" title="Antigua">Antigua</a>. This was during the denouement of the American Revolutionary War, and enforcement of the Act was problematic - now-foreign American vessels were no longer allowed to trade with British colonies in the <a href="/wiki/Caribbean_Sea.html" title="Caribbean Sea">Caribbean Sea</a>, an unpopular rule with both the colonies and the Americans. After seizing four American vessels off <a href="/wiki/Nevis.html" title="Nevis">Nevis</a>, Nelson was sued by the captains of the ships for illegal seizure. As the merchants of Nevis supported them, Nelson was in peril of imprisonment and had to remain sequestered on <i>Boreas</i> for eight months. It took that long for the courts to deny the captains their claims, but in the interim Nelson met Fanny Nesbit, a widow native to Nevis. Nelson and Fanny were married on <a href="/wiki/March_11.html" title="March 11">11 March</a> <a href="/wiki/1787.html" title="1787">1787</a> at the end of his tour of duty in the Caribbean.</p>
<p>Nelson lacked a command for a few years after 1789. He lived on half pay during this time (a reasonably common occurrence in the peacetime Royal Navy). Then, as the <a href="/wiki/French_Revolution.html" title="French Revolution">French Revolutionary</a> government began aggressive moves beyond <a href="/wiki/France.html" title="France">France</a>'s borders, Nelson was recalled to service. Given command of the 64-gun <a href="/wiki/HMS_Agamemnon_%281781%29.html" title="HMS Agamemnon (1781)"><i>Agamemnon</i></a> in 1793, he soon started a long series of battles and engagements that would seal his place in history.</p>
<p>He was first assigned to the Mediterranean, based out of the <a href="/wiki/Kingdom_of_Naples.html" title="Kingdom of Naples">Kingdom of Naples</a>. In 1794 he was wounded in the face by stones and debris thrown up by a close cannon shot during a joint operation at <a href="/wiki/Calvi.html" title="Calvi">Calvi</a>, <a href="/wiki/Corsica.html" title="Corsica">Corsica</a>. As a result, Nelson lost the sight in his right eye and half of his right eyebrow. Despite popular legend, there is no evidence that Nelson ever wore an eye patch, though he was known to wear an eyeshade to protect his remaining eye.</p>
<p>In 1796 the position of commander-in-chief of the fleet in the Mediterranean passed to Sir <a href="/wiki/John_Jervis%2C_1st_Earl_of_St_Vincent.html" title="John Jervis, 1st Earl of St Vincent">John Jervis</a>, who appointed Nelson to be <a href="/wiki/Commodore_%28rank%29.html" title="Commodore (rank)">commodore</a> and to exercise independent command over the ships blockading the French coast. <i>Agamemnon</i>, often described as Nelson's favourite ship, was by now worn out and was sent back to England for repairs. Nelson was appointed to the 74-gun <a href="/wiki/HMS_Captain_%281787%29.html" title="HMS Captain (1787)">HMS <i>Captain</i></a>.</p>

Admiral Nelson</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>1797 was a full year for Nelson. On <a href="/wiki/February_14.html" title="February 14">14 February</a> he was largely responsible for the British victory at the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Cape_St._Vincent_%281797%29.html" title="Battle of Cape St. Vincent (1797)">Battle of Cape St. Vincent</a>. Here he showed his flair for dramatic and bold action. Under the command of Sir John Jervis, the British fleet was ordered to "tack in line," but Nelson disobeyed these orders and gybed in order to prevent the Spanish fleet from escaping. He then boarded two enemy ships in succession, an unusual and bold move which was cheered by the whole fleet. Nelson himself led the boarding parties, which was not usually done by high ranking officers.</p>
<p>In the aftermath of this victory, Nelson was <a href="/wiki/Knight.html" title="Knight">knighted</a> as a member of the <a href="/wiki/Order_of_the_Bath.html" title="Order of the Bath">Order of the Bath</a> (hence the postnominal initials "KB"). In April of the same year he was promoted to <a href="/wiki/Admiral_%28United_Kingdom%29.html" title="Admiral (United Kingdom)">Rear Admiral of the Blue</a>, the ninth highest rank in the Royal Navy. Promotion to admiral at this time was not based on merit but solely on seniority and the availability of positions to fill. Able captains such as Nelson were appointed <a href="/wiki/Commodore_%28RN%29.html" title="Commodore (RN)">commodore</a> temporarily, a position which had the same pay and responsibilities as an admiral. Later in the year, while commanding <a href="/wiki/HMS_Theseus_%281786%29.html" title="HMS Theseus (1786)"><i>Theseus</i></a> during an <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Santa_Cruz_de_Tenerife_%281797%29.html" title="Battle of Santa Cruz de Tenerife (1797)">unsuccessful expedition</a> to conquer <a href="/wiki/Santa_Cruz_de_Tenerife.html" title="Santa Cruz de Tenerife">Santa Cruz de Tenerife</a>, Nelson was shot in the right arm with a musketball, fracturing his <a href="/wiki/Humerus.html" title="Humerus">humerus</a> bone in multiple places. Since medical science of the day counselled amputation for almost all serious limb wounds (to prevent death by gangrene), Nelson lost almost his entire right arm and was unfit for duty until mid-December. He referred to the stub as "my fin."</p>
<p>This was not his only reverse. In December 1796, on leaving <a href="/wiki/Elba.html" title="Elba">Elba</a> for <a href="/wiki/Gibraltar.html" title="Gibraltar">Gibraltar</a>, Nelson transferred his flag to the <a href="/wiki/Frigate.html" title="Frigate">frigate</a> <i>Minerve</i> (of French construction, commanded by Captain Cockburn). A Spanish frigate, <i>Santa Sabina</i>, was captured during the passage and Lieutenant Hardy was put in charge of the captured vessel. The following morning, two Spanish ships of the line and one frigate appeared. Nelson decided to flee, leaving <i>Santa Sabina</i> to be recovered by the Spanish and Hardy was captured. The Spanish captain who was on board <i>Minerve</i> was later exchanged for Hardy in Gibraltar.</p>
<p>In 1798 Nelson was once again responsible for a great victory over the French. The <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_the_Nile.html" title="Battle of the Nile">Battle of the Nile</a> (also known as the Battle of Aboukir Bay) took place on <a href="/wiki/August_1.html" title="August 1">1 August</a> <a href="/wiki/1798.html" title="1798">1798</a>. The battle effectively ended Napoleon's ambition to take the war to the British in <a href="/wiki/India.html" title="India">India</a>. The forces <a href="/wiki/Napoleon.html" title="Napoleon">Napoleon</a> had brought to <a href="/wiki/Egypt.html" title="Egypt">Egypt</a> were stranded. Napoleon attempted to march north along the <a href="/wiki/Mediterranean_Sea.html" title="Mediterranean Sea">Mediterranean</a> coast but his army was defeated at the <a href="/wiki/Siege_of_Acre_%281799%29.html" title="Siege of Acre (1799)">Siege of Acre</a> by Captain Sir <a href="/wiki/Sidney_Smith_%28admiral%29.html" title="Sidney Smith (admiral)">Sidney Smith</a>. Napoleon then left his army and sailed back to France, evading detection by British ships.</p>

<p>For the spectacular victory of the Nile, Nelson was granted the title of Baron Nelson of the Nile. (Nelson felt cheated that he was not awarded a more prestigious title; <a href="/wiki/John_Jervis%2C_1st_Earl_of_St_Vincent.html" title="John Jervis, 1st Earl of St Vincent">Sir John Jervis</a> had been made Earl of St. Vincent for his part in the battle of St. Vincent, but the British Government insisted that an officer who was not the commander-in-chief could not be raised to any peerage higher than a barony). Nelson felt throughout his life that his accomplishments were not fully rewarded by the British government, a fact he ascribed to his humble birth and lack of political connections as compared to Sir John Jervis or <a href="/wiki/Arthur_Wellesley%2C_1st_Duke_of_Wellington.html" title="Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington">The Duke of Wellington</a>).</p>

<p>Not content to rest on his laurels, Nelson then rescued the Neapolitan royal family from a French invasion in December. During this time he fell in love with <a href="/wiki/Emma_Hamilton.html" title="Emma Hamilton">Emma Hamilton</a> - the young wife of the elderly British ambassador to <a href="/wiki/Naples.html" title="Naples">Naples</a>. Emma became Nelson's mistress, returning to England to live openly with him, and eventually they had a daughter, Horatia.</p>
<p>In 1799 Nelson was promoted to <a href="/wiki/Admiral_%28United_Kingdom%29.html" title="Admiral (United Kingdom)">Rear Admiral of the Red</a>, the seventh highest rank in the Royal Navy. He was then assigned to the new <a href="/wiki/Second-rate.html" title="Second-rate">second-rate</a> <a  class="new" title="HMS Foudroyant (1798)"><i>Foudroyant</i></a>. In July he aided <a href="/wiki/Admiral_Ushakov.html" title="Admiral Ushakov">Admiral Ushakov</a> with the reconquest of <a href="/wiki/Naples.html" title="Naples">Naples</a> and was made Duke of <a href="/wiki/Bronte%2C_Sicily.html" title="Bronte, Sicily">Bronte</a> by the Neapolitan king. Personal problems and some upper-level disappointment at his professional conduct caused him to be recalled to England, but public knowledge of his affair with Lady Hamilton eventually induced the Admiralty to send him back to sea, if only to get him away from her.</p>
<p>Some have suggested that a head wound Nelson received at Aboukir Bay was partially responsible for his personal conduct and for the way he managed the Neapolitan campaign. He was accused of allowing the monarchists to kill prisoners contrary to the laws of war. Perhaps Nelson's zeal was due simultaneously to his English hatred of <a href="/wiki/Jacobin.html" title="Jacobin">Jacobins</a> and his status as a Neapolitan royalist (as the Duke of <a href="/wiki/Bronte%2C_Sicily.html" title="Bronte, Sicily">Bronte</a>). The Neapolitan campaign is now considered something of a disgrace to his name. On <a href="/wiki/January_1.html" title="January 1">1 January</a> <a href="/wiki/1801.html" title="1801">1801</a> Nelson was promoted to <a href="/wiki/Admiral_%28United_Kingdom%29.html" title="Admiral (United Kingdom)">Vice Admiral of the Blue</a> (the sixth highest rank). Within a few months he took part in the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Copenhagen.html" title="Battle of Copenhagen">Battle of Copenhagen</a> (<a href="/wiki/April_2.html" title="April 2">2 April</a> <a href="/wiki/1801.html" title="1801">1801</a>) which was fought in order to break up the armed neutrality of <a href="/wiki/Denmark.html" title="Denmark">Denmark</a>, <a href="/wiki/Sweden.html" title="Sweden">Sweden</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Russia.html" title="Russia">Russia</a>. During the action, Nelson was ordered to cease battle by his commander, Sir <a href="/wiki/Hyde_Parker.html" title="Hyde Parker">Hyde Parker</a>, who believed that the Danish fire was too strong. In a famous incident, however, Nelson claimed he could not see the signal flags conveying the order, pointedly raising his telescope to his blind eye. His action was approved in retrospect and in May he became commander-in-chief in the <a href="/wiki/Baltic_Sea.html" title="Baltic Sea">Baltic Sea</a>. He was awarded the title of Viscount Nelson by the British crown.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Napoleon was massing forces to invade England. Nelson was placed in charge of defending the <a href="/wiki/English_Channel.html" title="English Channel">English Channel</a> in order to thwart any such invasion. However, on <a href="/wiki/October_22.html" title="October 22">22 October</a> <a href="/wiki/1801.html" title="1801">1801</a> an armistice was signed between the British and the French, and Nelson — in poor health again — retired to England where he stayed with his friends, <a href="/wiki/William_Hamilton_%28diplomat%29.html" title="William Hamilton (diplomat)">Sir William</a> and Lady Hamilton. The three embarked on a tour of England and Wales, culminating in a stay in <a href="/wiki/Birmingham.html" title="Birmingham">Birmingham</a>.

<p>The <a href="/wiki/Peace_of_Amiens.html" title="Peace of Amiens">Peace of Amiens</a> was not to last long and Nelson soon returned to duty. He was appointed commander-in-chief in the Mediterranean. Assigned to <a href="/wiki/HMS_Victory.html" title="HMS Victory">HMS <i>Victory</i></a> in May 1803, Nelson joined the blockade of <a href="/wiki/Toulon%2C_France.html" title="Toulon, France">Toulon, France</a>. He would not set foot on dry land again for more than two years.</p>
<p>Nelson was promoted to <a href="/wiki/Admiral_%28United_Kingdom%29.html" title="Admiral (United Kingdom)">Vice Admiral of the White</a> (the fifth highest rank) while still at sea, on <a href="/wiki/April_23.html" title="April 23">23 April</a> <a href="/wiki/1804.html" title="1804">1804</a>. The French fleet slipped out of Toulon in early 1805 and headed for the West Indies. (See <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Cape_Finisterre_%281805%29.html" title="Battle of Cape Finisterre (1805)">battle of Cape Finisterre (1805)</a> for a summary of this campaign.) A fierce chase failed to turn them up and Nelson's health forced him to retire to <a href="/wiki/Merton_%28historic_parish%29.html" title="Merton (historic parish)">Merton</a> in England.</p>
<p>Within two months Nelson returned to sea. On <a href="/wiki/September_13.html" title="September 13">13 September</a> <a href="/wiki/1805.html" title="1805">1805</a> he was called upon to oppose the French and Spanish fleets which had managed to join up and take refuge in the harbour of <a href="/wiki/C%C3%A1diz.html" title="Cádiz">Cádiz</a>, <a href="/wiki/Spain.html" title="Spain">Spain</a>.</p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/October_21.html" title="October 21">21 October</a> <a href="/wiki/1805.html" title="1805">1805</a> Nelson engaged in his final battle, the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Trafalgar.html" title="Battle of Trafalgar">Battle of Trafalgar</a>. Napoleon Bonaparte had been massing forces once again for an invasion of the British Isles, but he decided that his navy was not adequate to secure the Channel for the invasion barges. Thus, Napoleon had started moving his troops for a campaign elsewhere in Europe. On 19 October the French and Spanish fleet set sail from Cádiz, probably because <a href="/wiki/Pierre-Charles_Villeneuve.html" title="Pierre-Charles Villeneuve">Pierre-Charles Villeneuve</a>, the French commander, had learned that he was to be replaced. Nelson, with twenty-seven ships, engaged the thirty-three opposing ships.</p>
<p>Nelson's last dispatch, written on the 21 October, read:</p>

</div>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p>At daylight saw the Enemy's Combined Fleet from East to E.S.E.; bore away; made the signal for Order of Sailing, and to Prepare for Battle; the Enemy with their heads to the Southward: at seven the Enemy wearing in succession. May the Great God, whom I worship, grant to my Country, and for the benefit of Europe in general, a great and glorious Victory; and may no misconduct in any one tarnish it; and may humanity after Victory be the predominant feature in the British Fleet. For myself, individually, I commit my life to Him who made me, and may his blessing light upon my endeavours for serving my Country faithfully. To Him I resign myself and the just cause which is entrusted to me to defend. Amen. Amen.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As the two fleets moved towards engagement, Nelson ran up a thirty-one flag signal to the rest of the fleet, spelling out the famous phrase "<a href="/wiki/England_expects_that_every_man_will_do_his_duty.html" title="England expects that every man will do his duty">England expects that every man will do his duty</a>". The original signal that Nelson wished to make to the fleet was <i>Nelson confides that every man will do his duty</i> (meaning 'is confident that they will'). The signal officer asked Nelson if he could substitute the word 'expects' for 'confides' as 'expects' was included in the code devised by <a href="/wiki/Home_Riggs_Popham.html" title="Home Riggs Popham">Sir Home Popham</a>, whereas 'confides' would have to be spelled out letter by letter. Another officer suggested that "England" would be more powerful than "Nelson." Nelson agreed, and the signal was run up <i>Victory</i>'s <a href="/wiki/Mizzenmast.html" title="Mizzenmast">mizzenmast</a>.</p>

<p>After crippling the French flagship <a href="/wiki/French_ship_Bucentaure_%281804%29.html" title="French ship Bucentaure (1804)"><i>Bucentaure</i></a>, <i>Victory</i> moved on to the <a href="/wiki/French_ship_Redoutable_%281791%29.html" title="French ship Redoutable (1791)"><i>Redoutable</i></a>. The two ships became entangled, at which point snipers in the fighting tops of <i>Redoutable</i> were able to pour fire down onto the deck of <i>Victory</i>. Nelson was one of those hit: a bullet entered his shoulder, pierced his lung, and came to rest at the base of his spine. Nelson retained consciousness for four hours, but died soon after the battle ended with a British victory.(See <a href="/wiki/Horatio_Nelson%2C_1st_Viscount_Nelson#Last_words.html" title="Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson">Nelson's last words</a>.)</p>

The bullet that killed Nelson.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Nelson was noted for his considerable ability to inspire and bring out the best in his men, to the point that it gained a name: "The Nelson Touch". Famous even while alive, after his death he was lionised like almost no other military figure in British history (his only peers are the <a href="/wiki/John_Churchill%2C_1st_Duke_of_Marlborough.html" title="John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough">Duke of Marlborough</a> and Nelson's contemporary, the <a href="/wiki/Arthur_Wellesley%2C_1st_Duke_of_Wellington.html" title="Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington">Duke of Wellington</a>). Most military historians believe Nelson's ability to inspire officers of the highest rank and seamen of the lowest was central to his many victories, as was his unequalled ability to both strategically plan his campaigns and tactically shift his forces in the midst of battle. Certainly, he ranks as one of the greatest field commanders in military history. Many consider him to have been the greatest warrior of the seas.</p>
<p>It must also be said that his "Nelson touch" also worked with non-seamen; he was beloved in England by virtually everyone. (The only people not affected by him were those offended by his affair with Lady Hamilton.) Now as then, he is a popular hero, included in the top 10 of the <i><a href="/wiki/100_Greatest_Britons.html" title="100 Greatest Britons">100 Greatest Britons</a></i> poll sponsored by the <a href="/wiki/BBC.html" title="BBC">BBC</a> and voted for by the public, and commemorated in the extensive <a href="/wiki/Trafalgar_200.html" title="Trafalgar 200">Trafalgar 200</a> celebrations in 2005, including the <a href="/wiki/International_Fleet_Review.html" title="International Fleet Review">International Fleet Review</a>. Even today phrases such as "<a href="/wiki/England_expects.html" title="England expects">England expects</a>" and <a href="/wiki/111_%28number%29#In_other_fields.html" title="111 (number)">"nelson" (meaning "111")</a> remain closely associated with English sporting teams.</p>

The first large monument to Nelson was a 43.5 m tall pillar on <a href="/wiki/Glasgow_Green.html" title="Glasgow Green">Glasgow Green</a> erected less than year after his death in 1806. <a href="/wiki/Nelson%27s_Monument.html" title="Nelson's Monument">Nelson's Monument</a> was later constructed atop <a href="/wiki/Calton_Hill%2C_Edinburgh.html" title="Calton Hill, Edinburgh">Calton Hill</a> in <a href="/wiki/Edinburgh.html" title="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a>. The first monument funded by popular subscription, sculpted by <a href="/wiki/Richard_Westmacott.html" title="Richard Westmacott">Richard Westmacott</a>, was erected in Birmingham in 1809. Westmacott also sculpted memorials in <a href="/wiki/Liverpool.html" title="Liverpool">Liverpool</a> and <a href="/wiki/Barbados.html" title="Barbados">Barbados</a>. A columnar Monument in <a href="/wiki/Great_Yarmouth.html" title="Great Yarmouth">Great Yarmouth</a> to Nelson was started before his death but only completed in 1819. This is sometimes known as the "<a href="/wiki/Britannia.html" title="Britannia">Britannia</a> Monument" as it is topped by that martial female rather than a statue of Nelson; a statue of Nelson can however be found in the grounds of <a href="/wiki/Norwich_Cathedral.html" title="Norwich Cathedral">Norwich Cathedral</a> alongside the other Napoleonic hero, the <a href="/wiki/Duke_of_Wellington.html" title="Duke of Wellington">Duke of Wellington</a>, near the school he attended.</p>

<p>There is also a memorial to Nelson on the banks of the <a href="/wiki/Menai_Straits.html" title="Menai Straits">Menai Straits</a> in <a href="/wiki/North_Wales.html" title="North Wales">North Wales</a>.

It was created by Admiral Lord Clarence Paget, who lived in the mansion and who was an enthusiastic amateur sculptor.</p>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/Montreal.html" title="Montreal">Montreal</a> (where Nelson had reportedly fallen in love with a young French-Canadian woman), there is a monument to Nelson (erected in 1809) in <a href="/wiki/Place_Jacques-Cartier.html" title="Place Jacques-Cartier">Place Jacques-Cartier</a>, which was a marketplace at the time. It has carved scenes from Nelson's career around the base and the statue on top was claimed to be the oldest public statue of Nelson in the world. (It was removed for several years due to excessive weathering but has been replaced after restoration).</p>

<p>One of the most unusual monuments was constructed on Salisbury Plain, within cannon shot of Stonehenge, on land then owned by the Marquess of Queensbury. The monument consists of a series of clumps of trees in otherwise arable farmland. Known as the "Nile Clumps" they have been arranged to represent the positioning of French and British ships at the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_the_Nile.html" title="Battle of the Nile">Battle of the Nile</a>, considered as Nelson's greatest tactical victory.

<h2>Nelson's descendants</h2>
<p>Nelson had no legitimate children; his daughter, Horatia, by Lady Hamilton (who died in poverty when their daughter was 13), subsequently married the Rev. Philip Ward and died in 1881. She and Rev. Ward had nine children: Horatio Nelson (born <a href="/wiki/December_8.html" title="December 8">8 December</a> <a href="/wiki/1822.html" title="1822">1822</a>); Eleanor Philippa (born April 1824); Marmaduke Philip Smyth (born <a href="/wiki/May_27.html" title="May 27">27 May</a> <a href="/wiki/1825.html" title="1825">1825</a>); John James Stephen (<a href="/wiki/February_13.html" title="February 13">13 February</a> <a href="/wiki/1827.html" title="1827">1827</a>–<a href="/wiki/1829.html" title="1829">1829</a>); Nelson (born <a href="/wiki/May_8.html" title="May 8">8 May</a> <a href="/wiki/1828.html" title="1828">1828</a>); William George (born <a href="/wiki/April_8.html" title="April 8">8 April</a> <a href="/wiki/1830.html" title="1830">1830</a>); Edmund (<a href="/wiki/July_10.html" title="July 10">10 July</a> <a href="/wiki/1832.html" title="1832">1832</a>–<a href="/wiki/1833.html" title="1833">1833</a>); Horatio (born <a href="/wiki/November_24.html" title="November 24">24 November</a> <a href="/wiki/1833.html" title="1833">1833</a>), Philip (born May 1834) and Caroline (born January 1836).</p>
<p>Because Lord Nelson had no legitimate heirs, the Viscountcy and 1798 Barony of Nelson (both "of the Nile and of Burnham Thorpe in the County of Norfolk") became extinct upon his death. However, the 1801 Barony of Nelson ("of the Nile and of Hilborough in the County of Norfolk") passed by a special remainder to Lord Nelson's brother, <a href="/wiki/William_Nelson%2C_1st_Earl_Nelson.html" title="William Nelson, 1st Earl Nelson">The Reverend William Nelson</a>. William was also created <a href="/wiki/Earl_Nelson.html" title="Earl Nelson">Earl Nelson</a> in recognition of his brother's services, which title is still extant.</p>

<h2>Literary influences</h2>
<p>Although Nelson's exploits are often claimed to have provided inspiration for fictional characters such as <a href="/wiki/Jack_Aubrey.html" title="Jack Aubrey">Jack Aubrey</a>, <a href="/wiki/Horatio_Hornblower.html" title="Horatio Hornblower">Horatio Hornblower</a> and <a href="/wiki/Honor_Harrington.html" title="Honor Harrington">Honor Harrington</a>, a close reading of the books does not bear this out. It is more likely Nelson's fame makes him the only naval figure of the time whom reviewers recall. Nelson appears, unnamed but recognizable, in <a href="/wiki/Susan_Sontag.html" title="Susan Sontag">Susan Sontag</a>'s novel <i><a  class="new" title="The Volcano Lover: A Romance">The Volcano Lover: A Romance</a></i>, which centers on <a href="/wiki/Emma%2C_Lady_Hamilton.html" title="Emma, Lady Hamilton">Lady Hamilton</a>'s affair with him. Nelson himself appears as a ghost in <a href="/wiki/Amber_Benson.html" title="Amber Benson">Amber Benson</a>'s and <a href="/wiki/Christopher_Golden.html" title="Christopher Golden">Christopher Golden</a>'s <i><a href="/wiki/Ghosts_of_Albion.html" title="Ghosts of Albion">Ghosts of Albion</a></i>. <a href="/wiki/Barry_Unsworth.html" title="Barry Unsworth">Barry Unsworth</a>'s <i><a  class="new" title="Losing Nelson">Losing Nelson</a></i> centres on Nelson's actions in Naples in 1799.</p>

<p><a name="Last_words" id="Last_words"></a></p>
<h2>Last words</h2>
<p>Nelson's final words (as related by <i>Victory'</i>s Surgeon <a href="/wiki/William_Beatty.html" title="William Beatty">William Beatty</a>, based on the accounts of those who were with Nelson when he died) were "Thank God I have done my duty." According to Beatty, he repeated these words several times until he became unable to speak.</p>
<p>In his dying hours, Nelson was also attended by his chaplain, Alexander Scott; his steward, Chevalier; and the <a href="/wiki/Purser.html" title="Purser">purser</a>, Walter Burke. Their accounts have been available to Nelson's modern biographers. In those accounts, Nelson's last words were "Drink, drink. Fan, fan. Rub, rub." This was a request to alleviate his symptoms of thirst, heat, and the pains of his wounds. (Pocock, Horatio Nelson, 1987, p.331.)</p>
<p>It is a common misconception that Nelson's last words were, "Kiss me, Hardy", spoken to the captain of HMS <i>Victory</i>, <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Hardy_%28naval_officer%29.html" title="Thomas Hardy (naval officer)">Thomas Hardy</a>. Nelson did, in fact, say these words to Hardy a short time before his death, but they were not his last words as Hardy was not present at his death, having been called back on deck. Some have speculated that Nelson actually said "Kismet, Hardy", but this is impossible, since the word <i><a href="/wiki/Kismet.html" title="Kismet">kismet</a></i> did not enter the English language until much later, although he may have heard the word used by a Turk.</p>

<h2>"Tapping the Admiral"</h2>
<p>According to a <a href="/wiki/Legend.html" title="Legend">legend</a>, naval <a href="/wiki/Rum.html" title="Rum">rum</a> rather than brandy was used to preserve his body in a barrel until it was returned to England. It is claimed that his crew had drunk half of the rum from the barrel by the time they reached London; the crew were supposed to have sucked out the rum using thin straws. However, this legend is false as it is clearly documented that Nelson's body was preserved in brandy. Also the crew had great respect for Nelson, and his body was guarded night and day by a marine. Nevertheless, this legend has given rise to the slang term "tapping the Admiral", meaning illicit drinking, and may be related to the nickname given to Naval rum rations later, "Nelson's Blood" (although this may possibly be a deliberate echo of the <a href="/wiki/Eucharist.html" title="Eucharist">Communion</a> ritual).</p>
