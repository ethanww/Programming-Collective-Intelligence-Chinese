<p>The <a href="/wiki/Hashshashin.html" title="Hashshashin">Hashshashin</a> (also Hashishin, Hashashiyyin or Assassins) had a militant basis as a religious sect (often referred to as a cult) of Ismaili Muslims from the Nizari sub-sect. They were thought to be active in the 8th to 14th centuries. This mystic <a href="/wiki/Secret_society.html" title="Secret society">secret society</a> specialized in terrorising the <a href="/wiki/Abbasid.html" title="Abbasid">Abbasid</a> elite with fearlessly executed, politically motivated assassinations. The word "assassin" is derived from their name. Their own name for the sect was <i>al-da'wa al-jadīda</i> (الدعوةالجديدة) which means "the new doctrine." They called themselves <i>fedayeen</i> from the Arabic fidā'ī, which means "one who is ready to sacrifice his/her life for a cause."</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Benjamin_of_Tudela.html" title="Benjamin of Tudela">Benjamin of Tudela</a> provided the first western account of the sect. <a href="/wiki/Marco_Polo.html" title="Marco Polo">Marco Polo</a>'s elaborate account is probably fictionalized in part. He said that recruits were promised <a href="/wiki/Heaven.html" title="Heaven">Paradise</a> in return for dying in action. It was said that they were drugged, often with materials such as <a href="/wiki/Hashish.html" title="Hashish">hashish</a> (although some suggest <a href="/wiki/Opium.html" title="Opium">opium</a> and <a href="/wiki/Wine.html" title="Wine">wine</a> instead, despite all three drugs being condemned by Islamic religious authorities and interpretations of the time) then spirited away to a garden stocked with attractive and compliant women and fountains of wine. At this time, they were awakened and it was explained to them that such was their reward for the deed, convincing them that their leader, <a href="/wiki/Hassan-i-Sabah.html" title="Hassan-i-Sabah">Hassan-i-Sabah</a>, could open the gates to Paradise. The name <i>assassin</i> is derived from either <i>hasishin</i> for the supposed influence of their attacks and disregard for their own lives in the process, or <i>hassansin</i> for their leader. All this history, however, is tenuous, as it relies entirely on crusader-authored histories which have been traditionally very unreliable for information about native cultures.</p>
<p>Nowadays, it is known that <i>hashishinnya</i> was an offensive term used to depict this cult by its Muslim and Mongolian detractors; the extreme zeal of Nizarites and the very cold preparation to murder makes it very unlikely they ever used drugs, while there is evidence that one of the first of Hassan's sons was sentenced to death by his father only for drinking a little wine. Moreover, despite many unlikely legends, they usually died along with their target (a tale tells of a mother being sad knowing her son survived a "mission").<sup title="The text in the vicinity of this tag needs citation." class="noprint">[<a  title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><i>citation&#160;needed</i></a>]</sup> As far as is known they only used daggers (no other weapons, poison or whatever fictional records make them use) and it seems that they killed only five Westerners during the time of the Crusades.</p>

<p>According to <i>The <a href="/wiki/American_Heritage_Dictionary.html" title="American Heritage Dictionary">American Heritage Dictionary</a></i>, to assassinate is "To <a href="/wiki/Murder.html" title="Murder">murder</a> (a prominent person) by surprise attack, as for political reasons."<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a  title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Unlike some topics, such as terrorism, wherein there is a substantial <a href="/wiki/Grey_area.html" title="Grey area">grey area</a> and often bitter controversy between which specific instances qualify or even what standards should be used, the "<a href="/wiki/Common_sense.html" title="Common sense">common sense</a>" classification of assassination stated at the outset of this article seems to stand with few objections. However, this does open larger issues concerning interpretation, notably regarding attempted killings by those with other motives. For instance, should a murder be considered an assassination only if the victim is a political leader or public figure hostile to the agenda of the killer, or should the term include killings where the assassin's primary motivation is based solely on the victim's status as a celebrity in order to attract attention to his cause or for purely personal reasons?</p>
<p>Notable instances in which this definitional problem has come into effect include the attempt on the life of <a href="/wiki/United_States_President.html" title="United States President">United States President</a> <a href="/wiki/Ronald_Reagan.html" title="Ronald Reagan">Ronald Reagan</a> by <a href="/wiki/John_Hinckley.html" title="John Hinckley">John Hinckley</a>, who was determined subsequently to have serious psychological problems and publicly stated his intent was to get the attention of actress <a href="/wiki/Jodie_Foster.html" title="Jodie Foster">Jodie Foster</a> rather than make any political statement. The killing of former <a href="/wiki/The_Beatles.html" title="The Beatles">Beatle</a> <a href="/wiki/John_Lennon.html" title="John Lennon">John Lennon</a> posed a similar problem — despite Lennon's outspokenness on many liberal political issues, his killer does not seem to have been more than an unstable <a href="/wiki/Fan_%28aficionado%29.html" title="Fan (aficionado)">fan</a>. The use of the term "assassination" to describe Lennon's murder is a matter of some additional debate, since Lennon was primarily an entertainer, not a political figure, and it could be argued that describing his killing as an assassination is no more appropriate than, for example, using the term to describe the murders of singers <a href="/wiki/Selena_Quintanilla.html" title="Selena Quintanilla">Selena Quintanilla</a> or <a href="/wiki/Marvin_Gaye.html" title="Marvin Gaye">Marvin Gaye</a>. The issue is further complicated by the fact that although Lennon was likely as outspoken politically as Reagan (and certainly as famous), Reagan was an elected official at the time, possibly requiring different criteria for Lennon's case.</p>
<p>One can take one of three positions (note that this consideration is of necessity strictly based upon language, not law): that the killing of someone <i>only for political, moral, or ideological reasons</i> constitutes an assassination (hence neither Reagan nor Lennon were the victims of assassins' attacks, while Ford was), that the killing of someone <i>serving in politics or public office</i> counts (thus Reagan's and Ford's attackers were would-be assassins, while Lennon's killer was not), or that anyone <i>with a significant level of political involvement</i> would be an assassination victim in the event of their murder (in which case all three instances would be assassinations or attempts).</p>
<p>While it must be acknowledged that attempting to read a person's thoughts is both imperfect and somewhat antithetical to the nature of such an issue, for the purposes of this article, the first, most conservative definition is taken. Although it is likely that the second is the most popular, the first is technically the most correct, and the third is generally considered to be too general in application. Therefore, all assassinations or attempts mentioned in the article will strictly follow the guidelines outlined at the outset to prevent confusion.</p>

<h3>Ancient history</h3>
<p>Some would argue that assassination is one of the oldest tools of <a href="/wiki/Power_politics.html" title="Power politics">power politics</a>, dating back to the earliest governments of the world.</p>
<p>Towards the end of the <a href="/wiki/Warring_States_Period.html" title="Warring States Period">Warring States Period</a> (3rd century BC) in China, the state <a href="/wiki/Qin.html" title="Qin">Qin</a> rose to hegemony over other states. The Prince of the state Yan felt the threat and sought to remove the Qin king (later <a href="/wiki/Qin_Shi_Huang.html" title="Qin Shi Huang">Qin Shi Huang</a>) and sent <a href="/wiki/Jing_Ke.html" title="Jing Ke">Jing Ke</a> for the mission. The assassination attempt was foiled and Jing Ke was killed on the spot.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Philip_II_of_Macedon.html" title="Philip II of Macedon">Philip II of Macedon</a>, the father of <a href="/wiki/Alexander_the_Great.html" title="Alexander the Great">Alexander the Great</a>, can be viewed as a victim of assassination. It is a fact, however, that by the fall of the Roman Republic assassination had become a commonly-accepted tool towards the end not only of improving one's own position, but to influence policy — the killing of Gaius <a href="/wiki/Julius_Caesar.html" title="Julius Caesar">Julius Caesar</a> being a notable example, though many <a href="/wiki/Emperors_of_Rome.html" title="Emperors of Rome">Emperors</a> met such an end. In whatever case, there seems to have not been a good deal of moral indignation at the practice amongst the political circles of the time, save, naturally, by the affected.</p>
<p>As the <a href="/wiki/Middle_Ages.html" title="Middle Ages">Middle Ages</a> came about from the <a href="/wiki/Fall_of_the_Roman_Empire.html" title="Fall of the Roman Empire">fall of the Roman Empire</a>, the moral and ethical dimensions of what was before a simple political tool began to take shape. Although in that period intentional <a href="/wiki/Regicide.html" title="Regicide">regicide</a> was an extremely rare occurrence, the situation changed dramatically with the <a href="/wiki/Renaissance.html" title="Renaissance">Renaissance</a> when the ideas of <i>tyrannomachy</i> (i.e. killing of a King when his rule becomes tyrannical) re-emerged and gained recognition. Many a head of state of the time fell at the hands of an assassin, such as <a href="/wiki/Henri_III_of_France.html" title="Henri III of France">Henri III</a> and <a href="/wiki/Henry_IV_of_France.html" title="Henry IV of France">Henry IV of France</a>. There were notable detractors, however; <a href="/wiki/Abd-ul-Mejid.html" title="Abd-ul-Mejid">Abd-ul-Mejid</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Ottoman_Empire.html" title="Ottoman Empire">Ottoman Empire</a> refused to put to death plotters against his life during his reign.</p>

<h3>Cold War</h3>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Cold_War.html" title="Cold War">Cold War</a> saw a dramatic increase in the number of political assassinations, likely due in large part to the <a href="/wiki/Ideology.html" title="Ideology">ideological</a> polarization of most of the <a href="/wiki/First_world.html" title="First world">First</a> and <a href="/wiki/Second_world.html" title="Second world">Second worlds</a>, whose adherents were more than willing to both justify and finance such killings. During the Kennedy era <a href="/wiki/Fidel_Castro.html" title="Fidel Castro">Fidel Castro</a> narrowly escaped death on several occasions at the hands of the CIA (a function of the agency's "<a href="/wiki/Executive_action.html" title="Executive action">executive action</a>" program) and CIA-backed rebels (there are accounts that exploding clams and poisoned shoes were employed); some allege that <a href="/wiki/Salvador_Allende.html" title="Salvador Allende">Salvador Allende</a> of <a href="/wiki/Chile.html" title="Chile">Chile</a> was another example, though specific proof is lacking. At the same time, the <a href="/wiki/KGB.html" title="KGB">KGB</a> made creative use of assassination to deal with high-profile defectors such as <a href="/wiki/Georgi_Markov.html" title="Georgi Markov">Georgi Markov</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Israel.html" title="Israel">Israel</a>'s <a href="/wiki/Mossad.html" title="Mossad">Mossad</a> made use of such tactics to eliminate <a href="/wiki/Palestinian.html" title="Palestinian">Palestinian</a> <a href="/wiki/Guerrilla_warfare.html" title="Guerrilla warfare">guerrillas</a>, politicians and revolutionaries, though some Israelis argue that the targeted often crossed the line between one or another or were even all three. Most major powers were not long in repudiating such tactics, for example during the presidency of <a href="/wiki/Gerald_Ford.html" title="Gerald Ford">Gerald Ford</a> in the United States in 1976 (<a href="/wiki/Executive_Order_12333.html" title="Executive Order 12333">Executive Order 12333</a>, which proscription was relaxed however by the <a href="/wiki/George_W._Bush_administration.html" title="George W.

In fact, the debate over the use of such tactics is not closed by any means; many accuse <a href="/wiki/Russia.html" title="Russia">Russia</a> of continuing to practice it in <a href="/wiki/Chechnya.html" title="Chechnya">Chechnya</a> and against Chechens abroad, as well as Israel in Palestine and against Palestinians abroad (as well as those Mossad deems a threat to Israeli national security, as in the aftermath of the <a href="/wiki/Munich_Massacre.html" title="Munich Massacre">Munich Massacre</a> during "Operation Wrath of God").

<h3>In the Israeli-Palestinian conflict</h3>
<p><i>See also <a href="/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces#Code_of_Conduct_against_terrorists.html" title="Israel Defense Forces">IDF: Code of Conduct against terrorists</a></i></p>
<p>In the course of the <a href="/wiki/Israeli-Palestinian_conflict.html" title="Israeli-Palestinian conflict">Israeli-Palestinian conflict</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces.html" title="Israel Defense Forces">Israel Defense Forces</a> (IDF) employed what they call "focused foiling" (<a href="/wiki/Hebrew_language.html" title="Hebrew language">Hebrew</a>: <span lang="he" xml:lang="he">סיכול ממוקד</span> <i><a  class="external text" title="http://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%A1%D7%99%D7%9B%D7%95%D7%9C_%D7%9E%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%A7%D7%93">sikul memukad</a></i>) against those considered proven to have intentions of performing a specific act of violence in the very near future or to be linked indirectly with several acts of violence (organizing, planning, researching means of destruction etc), thus raising the likelihood that his or her assassination would foil similar activities in the future. Usually, such strikes have been carried out by <a href="/wiki/Israeli_Air_Force.html" title="Israeli Air Force">Israeli Air Force</a> attack helicopters that fire <a href="/wiki/Guided_missile.html" title="Guided missile">guided missiles</a> toward the target, after the <a href="/wiki/Shin_Bet.html" title="Shin Bet">Shin Bet</a> supplies <a href="/wiki/Military_intelligence.html" title="Military intelligence">intelligence</a> for the target.</p>
<p>The exact nature of said proof in focused foiling situations is both controversial and classified, as it involves clandestine <a href="/wiki/Military_intelligence.html" title="Military intelligence">military intelligence</a> oriented means and operational decisions made by intelligence officers and commanders rather than being a part of a published justice system executed by lawyers and judges.</p>
<p>The IDF claims that targeted killings are only pursued to prevent future <a href="/wiki/Terrorism.html" title="Terrorism">terrorism</a> acts, not as revenge for past activities. It also claims that this practice is only used when there is absolutely no practical way of foiling the future acts by other means (e.g., arrest) with minimal risk to the soldiers or civilians. IDF also claims that the practice is only used when there is a certainty in the identification of the target, in order to minimize harm to innocent bystanders. These IDF claims have never been monitored or validated by an independent authority, and the IDF deliberations about the killings remain secret. Moreover, actual injury and death of innocent bystanders, unintended as they may be, remains a strong claim by opponents of these targeted killings.</p>
<p>Defenders of this practice point out that it is in accordance with the <a href="/wiki/Fourth_Geneva_Convention.html" title="Fourth Geneva Convention">Fourth Geneva Convention</a> (<a  class="external text" title="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Fourth_Geneva_Convention#Article_28">Part 3, Article 1, Section 28</a>) which reads: “The presence of a protected person may not be used to render certain points or areas immune from military operations,” and so they argue that international law explicitly gives Israel the right to conduct military operations against military targets under these circumstances.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a  title="">[2]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a  title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>Targeted killings are largely supported by Israeli society to various extents,<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a  title="">[4]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a  title="">[5]</a></sup> but there are exceptions: In 2003, 27 <a href="/wiki/Israeli_Air_Force.html" title="Israeli Air Force">IAF</a> Air Force pilots composed a letter of protest to the Air Force commander <a href="/wiki/Dan_Halutz.html" title="Dan Halutz">Dan Halutz</a>, announcing their refusal to continue and perform attacks on targets within Palestinian population centers, and claiming that the occupation of the Palestinians "morally corrupts the fabric of Israeli society". This letter, the first of its kind emanating from the Air Force, evoked a storm of political protest in Israel, with most circles condemning it as dereliction of duty. IDF ethics forbid soldiers from making public political affiliations, and subsequently the IDF chief of staff announced that all the signatories would be suspended from flight duty, after which some of the pilots recanted and removed their signature.</p>
<p>Some of the best known targeted killings by Israeli military were <a href="/wiki/Hamas.html" title="Hamas">Hamas</a> leaders <a href="/wiki/Salah_Shahade.html" title="Salah Shahade">Salah Shahade</a> (July 2002), <a href="/wiki/Sheikh_Ahmed_Yassin.html" title="Sheikh Ahmed Yassin">Sheikh Ahmed Yassin</a> (March 2004), <a href="/wiki/Abdel_Aziz_al-Rantissi.html" title="Abdel Aziz al-Rantissi">Abdel Aziz al-Rantissi</a> (April 2004) and <a href="/wiki/Adnan_al-Ghoul.html" title="Adnan al-Ghoul">Adnan al-Ghoul</a> (October 2004).</p>
<p>While the term "targeted killing" is mostly used within the context of the <a href="/wiki/Al-Aqsa_Intifada.html" title="Al-Aqsa Intifada">Al-Aqsa Intifada</a> by airborne attacks, <a href="/wiki/Israeli_security_forces.html" title="Israeli security forces">Israeli security forces</a> have reportedly assassinated top terrorists in the past, although this was never confirmed officially.

<h3>Assassination for money</h3>
<p>Individually, too, people have often found reasons to arrange the deaths of others through paid intermediaries. One who kills with no political motive or group loyalty who kills <i>only</i> for money is known as a <a href="/wiki/Hitman.html" title="Hitman">hitman</a> or contract killer. Note that by the definition accepted above, while such a killer is not, strictly speaking, an assassin, if the killing is ordered and financed towards a political end, then that killing must rightly be termed an assassination, and the hitman an assassin by extension.</p>
<p>Entire organizations have sometimes specialized in assassination as one of their services, to be gained for the right price. Besides the original <a href="/wiki/Hashshashin.html" title="Hashshashin">hashshashin</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Ninja.html" title="Ninja">ninja</a> clans of <a href="/wiki/Japan.html" title="Japan">Japan</a> were rumored to perform assassinations — though it can be pointed out that most of what was ever known about the ninja was <a href="/wiki/Rumor.html" title="Rumor">rumor</a> and <a href="/wiki/Hearsay.html" title="Hearsay">hearsay</a>. In the <a href="/wiki/United_States.html" title="United States">United States</a>, <a href="/wiki/Murder%2C_Inc..html" title="Murder, Inc.">Murder, Inc.</a>, an organization partnered to the <a href="/wiki/Mafia.html" title="Mafia">Mafia</a>, was formed for the sole purpose of performing assassinations for organized crime. In <a href="/wiki/Russia.html" title="Russia">Russia</a>, the <i>vory</i> (thieves), their version of the Mafia, are often known to provide assassinations for the right price, as well as engaging in it themselves for their own purposes. A professional hitman is called <i>kliner</i> (literally "cleaner") in Russia; he is used to clean away the target. The Finnish underworld uses the word "<a href="/wiki/Torpedo.html" title="Torpedo">torpedo</a>" for a contract killer.</p>

<p>While assassination for military purposes has long been espoused — <a href="/wiki/Sun_Tzu.html" title="Sun Tzu">Sun Tzu</a> argued for such in <i><a href="/wiki/The_Art_of_War.html" title="The Art of War">The Art of War</a></i>, as did <a href="/wiki/Niccol%C3%B2_Machiavelli.html" title="Niccolò Machiavelli">Machiavelli</a> in his <i><a href="/wiki/The_Prince.html" title="The Prince">The Prince</a></i> — in medieval times, an army and even a nation might be based upon and around a particularly strong, canny or charismatic leader, whose loss could paralyze the ability of both to make war. However, in modern warfare a soldier's mindset is generally considered to surround ideals far more than specific leaders. Theoretically, while the death of a soldier's leader definitely has a detrimental effect on morale, the cause for which they fight is at times strong enough to push through the loss of leadership.</p>
<p>It can be argued that, assassinating a military leader may run the risk of eliminating a later advocate of peace. As many would argue that military leaders, seeing the face of warfare and bearing a clearer sense of the war effort's effects, have more sagacity on the subject. There is the risk that the target may be an incompetent and could be replaced by a more competent leader. Not only that, but worse, there is a high chance such a killing will be treated as not only reinforcing evidence of the opponents' moral bankruptcy, but also "<a href="/wiki/Martyr.html" title="Martyr">martyr</a>" the leader, increasing their charisma posthumously and rallying still others to an enemy cause and hardening the enemies' resolve to fight — and resist entreaties to peace (indeed, the death in battle of <a href="/wiki/Gustavus_Adolphus_of_Sweden.html" title="Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden">Gustavus Adolphus</a> of <a href="/wiki/Sweden.html" title="Sweden">Sweden</a>, while not an assassination, led directly to the <a href="/wiki/Catholic.html" title="Catholic">Catholic</a> defeat at <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Luetzen_%281632%29.html" title="Battle of Luetzen (1632)">Lützen</a> as the infuriated Swedes rallied behind their fallen leader). Such an effect can be extremely detrimental to a group or state, but supporters might argue in return that when faced with a particularly brilliant leader, there is no choice but to take the chance and, essentially, hope for a more mediocre successor (one might use the example of the many attempts to kill the Athenian <a href="/wiki/Alcibiades.html" title="Alcibiades">Alcibiades</a> during the <a href="/wiki/Peloponnesian_War.html" title="Peloponnesian War">Peloponnesian War</a>, the American shooting down of <a href="/wiki/Isoroku_Yamamoto.html" title="Isoroku Yamamoto">Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto</a> during World War II, or arguably <a href="/wiki/Henry_IV_of_France.html" title="Henry IV of France">Henry IV of France</a>). Also, they might note that in a time-sensitive situation, such a killing could be useful if only to briefly buy time for a more permanent and effective plan to be set into motion or stall an army as reinforcements rush to the area. Another situation where assassination might have been beneficial, would have been the early assassination of <a href="/wiki/Osama_Bin_Laden.html" title="Osama Bin Laden">Osama Bin Laden</a>, which might have saved thousands of lives from the terrorist attacks that occurred on <a href="/wiki/September_11%2C_2001_attacks.html" title="September 11, 2001 attacks">September 11, 2001</a>.</p>
<p>There are a number of examples from <a href="/wiki/World_War_II.html" title="World War II">World War II</a>, the last <a href="/wiki/Total_war.html" title="Total war">total war</a>, which show how assassination can be used as an effective military tool both at a tactical and strategic level. The American's perception that <a href="/wiki/Otto_Skorzeny.html" title="Otto Skorzeny">Skorzeny's</a> <a href="/wiki/Commando.html" title="Commando">commandos</a> were trying to assassinate <a href="/wiki/Dwight_D._Eisenhower.html" title="Dwight D. Eisenhower">Eisenhower</a> during the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_the_Bulge.html" title="Battle of the Bulge">Battle of the Bulge</a> shows that military assassination, or the threat of it, if well timed can be a very effective tactical move. In an interview with the <i>New York Times</i> Skorzeny denied that he had ever intended to <a href="/wiki/Operation_Greif.html" title="Operation Greif">assassinate Eisenhower</a> and could prove it. <i>(page 155, Commando Extraordinary, by Charles Foley)</i>. There is also a mention in the same book <i>(Page 35)</i> of a British commando raid to "capture" German General <a href="/wiki/Erwin_Johannes_Eugen_Rommel.html" title="Erwin Johannes Eugen Rommel">Erwin Johannes Eugen Rommel</a> (also known as "The Desert Fox"). If he had been removed from the board, then that might well have had strategic effects. The British, too, decided not to try to assassinate Admiral <a href="/wiki/Wilhelm_Canaris.html" title="Wilhelm Canaris">Wilhelm Canaris</a>, head of the <a href="/wiki/Abwehr.html" title="Abwehr">Abwehr</a> (<i>German military intelligence</i>), because to do so might have improved the service.</p>

<h2>Assassination as a tool used by insurgent groups</h2>
<p>Insurgent groups have often employed assassination as a tool to further their causes. The <a href="/wiki/Irish_Republican_Army.html" title="Irish Republican Army">Irish Republican Army</a> guerrillas of 1919-1921 assassinated many <a href="/wiki/Royal_Irish_Constabulary.html" title="Royal Irish Constabulary">RIC</a> Police Intelligence officers during the <a href="/wiki/Irish_War_of_Independence.html" title="Irish War of Independence">Irish War of Independence</a>. <a href="/wiki/Michael_Collins_%28Irish_leader%29.html" title="Michael Collins (Irish leader)">Michael Collins</a> set up a special unit -- <a href="/wiki/Twelve_Apostles_%28Irish_counter-intelligence_organisation%29.html" title="Twelve Apostles (Irish counter-intelligence organisation)">the Squad</a> -- for this purpose, which had the effect of intimidating many policemen into resigning from the force. "The Squad"'s activities peaked with the assassination of 14 British agents in <a href="/wiki/Dublin.html" title="Dublin">Dublin</a> on <a href="/wiki/Bloody_Sunday_%281920%29.html" title="Bloody Sunday (1920)">Bloody Sunday (1920)</a>.</p>
<p>This tactic was used again by the <a href="/wiki/Provisional_IRA.html" title="Provisional IRA">Provisional IRA</a> during <a href="/wiki/The_Troubles.html" title="The Troubles">the Troubles</a> in <a href="/wiki/Northern_Ireland.html" title="Northern Ireland">Northern Ireland</a> (1969-present). Assassination of <a href="/wiki/Royal_Ulster_Constabulary.html" title="Royal Ulster Constabulary">RUC</a> officers and politicians was one of a number of methods used in the <a href="/wiki/Provisional_IRA_campaign_1969-1997.html" title="Provisional IRA campaign 1969-1997">Provisional IRA campaign 1969-1997</a>. The IRA also attempted to assassinate British <a href="/wiki/Prime_Minister.html" title="Prime Minister">Prime Minister</a> <a href="/wiki/Margaret_Thatcher.html" title="Margaret Thatcher">Margaret Thatcher</a> by bombing the Conservative Party Conference in a <a href="/wiki/Brighton.html" title="Brighton">Brighton</a> hotel. <a href="/wiki/Ulster_loyalism.html" title="Ulster loyalism">Loyalist paramilitaries</a> retaliated by assassinating Catholics at random and <a href="/wiki/Irish_nationalist.html" title="Irish nationalist">Irish nationalist</a> politicians.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Basque_people.html" title="Basque people">Basque</a> separatists <a href="/wiki/ETA.html" title="ETA">ETA</a> in <a href="/wiki/Spain.html" title="Spain">Spain</a> have assassinated many security and political figures since the late 1960s, notably <a href="/wiki/Luis_Carrero_Blanco.html" title="Luis Carrero Blanco">Luis Carrero Blanco</a> in 1973. Since the early 1990s, they have also targeted academics, journalists and local politicians who publicly disagreed with them, for assassination -- meaning that many of them needed armed police bodyguards.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Red_Brigades.html" title="Red Brigades">Red Brigades</a> in <a href="/wiki/Italy.html" title="Italy">Italy</a> carried out assassinations of political figures, as to a lesser extent, did the <a href="/wiki/Red_Army_Faction.html" title="Red Army Faction">Red Army Faction</a> in <a href="/wiki/Germany.html" title="Germany">Germany</a> in the 1970s and 1980s. <a href="/wiki/Middle_East.html" title="Middle East">Middle Eastern</a> groups, such as the <a href="/wiki/PLO.html" title="PLO">PLO</a> and <a href="/wiki/Hezbollah.html" title="Hezbollah">Hezbollah</a>, have all engaged in assassinations, though the higher intensity of armed conflict in the region compared to western Europe means that many of their actions are either better characterised as <a href="/wiki/Guerrilla.html" title="Guerrilla">guerrilla</a> operations or as random attacks on civilians -- especially the technique of <a href="/wiki/Suicide_bomb.html" title="Suicide bomb">suicide bombs</a>.</p>

<p><a name="Techniques" id="Techniques"></a></p>
<h2>Techniques</h2>
<p>Assassinations are the result of planning and preparation to create opportunity and then the application of chosen means. It is certain that the first strategies used were direct and simple: find the leader and <a href="/wiki/Stabbing.html" title="Stabbing">stab</a> or <a href="/wiki/Bludgeon.html" title="Bludgeon">bludgeon</a> them to death. This would have occurred only in close-knit groups where security was not thought needed, such as amongst nomadic or early sedentary peoples in <a href="/wiki/Mesopotamia.html" title="Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a> where disagreements would be solved with <a href="/wiki/Vigilante.html" title="Vigilante">vigilantism</a> (however it is important to note that information from this far back is very sketchy and debatable in nature). As <a href="/wiki/Civilization.html" title="Civilization">civilization</a> took root, however, many leaders began to have greater importance, and they would become more detached from the groups they ruled. This would have bought planning and <a href="/wiki/Subterfuge.html" title="Subterfuge">subterfuge</a> as major factors in successful assassination.</p>
<p>The key technique was <a href="/wiki/Infiltration.html" title="Infiltration">infiltration</a>, either physical concealment and stealthy movement or the attempt to gain access to a person's guard or staff with the aim of replacing or subverting them. The actual assassination would be the same close-contact stabbing or quieter <a href="/wiki/Asphyxia.html" title="Asphyxia">smothering</a> or strangulation, <a href="/wiki/Poison.html" title="Poison">poisons</a> and poisonous creatures were also used. The mushroom <a href="/wiki/Death_cap.html" title="Death cap">death cap</a> has been the traditional choice of assassins: it cannot be distinguished as poisonous by taste, and the symptoms of the poisoning show out only after some days or a week.</p>
<p>With the advent of effective <a href="/wiki/Ranged_weaponry.html" title="Ranged weaponry">ranged weaponry</a>, and later <a href="/wiki/Firearm.html" title="Firearm">firearms</a>, the position of an assassination target was more precarious. Bodyguards were no longer enough to hold back determined killers, who no longer needed to directly engage or even subvert the guard to kill the leader in question; it could be done from a great distance in a crowded square or even at a church, as with the <a href="/wiki/Pazzi_Conspiracy.html" title="Pazzi Conspiracy">Pazzi Conspiracy</a>, for example. Additionally the engagement of targets at greater distance dramatically increasing the chances for survival of an assassin. <a href="/wiki/Gunpowder.html" title="Gunpowder">Gunpowder</a> and other explosives also allowed the use of bombs or even greater concentrations of explosives for deeds requiring a larger touch; for an example, the <a href="/wiki/Gunpowder_Plot.html" title="Gunpowder Plot">Gunpowder Plot</a> could have 'assassinated' almost a thousand people.</p>
<p>It is interesting to note that even as more modern methods of killing became available, older ones were still encountered; indeed, in nations like <a href="/wiki/India.html" title="India">India</a> killings by knife or <a href="/wiki/Sword.html" title="Sword">sword</a> remain quite popular, as they do in <a href="/wiki/Sub-Saharan_Africa.html" title="Sub-Saharan Africa">sub-Saharan Africa</a> (for example, with the <a href="/wiki/Machete.html" title="Machete">machete</a>). In fact, since the development of firearms each region of the world seems to have its preferred methods of contract murder; besides those mentioned, explosives are quite popular in not only the Middle East but in most of Europe as well, save <a href="/wiki/Northern_Europe.html" title="Northern Europe">Northern Europe</a> where shootings become more common, whereas in the Americas assassinations are almost exclusively performed by gunshot. One can make various cases for any of these, including range, detectability, concealability, likelihood of kill, etc.</p>
<p>As the Renaissance gave way to the <a href="/wiki/Industrial_Revolution.html" title="Industrial Revolution">Industrial Revolution</a>, assassination became more sophisticated, right up to today. There are only eight main methods - hand, edged weapon, poison, bomb, close-range shot, long-range shot, use of heavy weapons, and the, as yet untried, use of weapons of mass destruction.</p>
<p>Explosives, especially the <a href="/wiki/Car_bomb.html" title="Car bomb">car bomb</a>, have became far more common, with <a href="/wiki/Grenade.html" title="Grenade">grenades</a> and remote-triggered <a href="/wiki/Land_mine.html" title="Land mine">landmines</a> also used, especially in the <a href="/wiki/Middle_East.html" title="Middle East">Middle East</a> and Balkans (the initial attempt on Archduke Franz Ferdinand's life was with a grenade). With heavy weapons, the <a href="/wiki/Rocket_propelled_grenade.html" title="Rocket propelled grenade">rocket propelled grenade</a> (RPG) has became a useful tool given the popularity of armored cars (discussed below), while Israeli forces have pioneered the use of aircraft-mounted missiles for assassination, as well as the innovative use of explosive devices.</p>
<p>One option glamorized in the media is using a <a href="/wiki/Sniper_rifle.html" title="Sniper rifle">sniper rifle</a>, such as the <a href="/wiki/L96.html" title="L96">L96</a>. The problem with this method is that a sniper rifle is difficult to obtain, train with, conspicuous in size and so hard to conceal and transport. Ownership also attracts the attention of <a href="/wiki/Police.html" title="Police">police</a> and <a href="/wiki/Government.html" title="Government">government</a> authorities. Despite its notorious disadvantages a more common tool is the <a href="/wiki/Handgun.html" title="Handgun">handgun</a>. Deployed correctly and left at the scene of the incident, the completion of the contract can even be portrayed as a <a href="/wiki/Suicide.html" title="Suicide">suicide</a>.</p>

<h2>Counter-measures</h2>
<p>It would not be a large stretch to say that, in addition to <a href="/wiki/Terrorism.html" title="Terrorism">terrorism</a>, political assassination is one of the biggest threats to any modern <a href="/wiki/State.html" title="State">state</a> and its <a href="/wiki/Government.html" title="Government">government</a>. As such, the measures to which a leader goes to avoid professional killers ranges from what an average person would consider to be farcical to the paranoid to the downright bizarre. Many would argue, though, that such measures are a lot more effective than they first appear, and that in the world of a new threat seemingly each week <sup title="The text in the vicinity of this tag needs citation." class="noprint">[<a  title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><i>citation&#160;needed</i></a>]</sup>, there is no such thing as too much security.</p>
<p>One of the earliest forms of defense against assassins is without doubt the <a href="/wiki/Bodyguard.html" title="Bodyguard">bodyguard</a>. Essentially, the bodyguard functions as a counter-assassin, attempting to neutralize the killer before they can make contact with or inflict harm upon the "principal", or protected/targeted official. This function was often executed by the leader's most loyal warriors, and was extremely effective throughout most of early human history, to the point where a direct assassination had to be replaced with carefully-planned <a href="/wiki/Subterfuge.html" title="Subterfuge">subterfuge</a>, such as poison (which was answered by the <a href="/wiki/Food_taster.html" title="Food taster">food taster</a> such as the <a href="/wiki/Yeomen_Warders.html" title="Yeomen Warders">Beefeaters</a> protecting the <a href="/wiki/England.html" title="England">English</a> monarchs), and even then such methods were often thwarted. Notable examples of bodyguards would include the Roman <a href="/wiki/Praetorian_Guard.html" title="Praetorian Guard">Praetorian Guard</a> or the Ottoman <a href="/wiki/Janissary.html" title="Janissary">janissaries</a> — although, in both cases, it should be noted that the protectors often became assassins themselves, exploiting their power to make the <a href="/wiki/Head_of_state.html" title="Head of state">head of state</a> a virtual hostage at their whim or eliminating threatening leaders altogether. Indeed, assassinations both then and today are most often effective when they have the support, tacit or open, of other powerful figures. This is less a concern in the West, where organizations such as the British <a href="/wiki/Special_Branch.html" title="Special Branch">Special Branch</a> and American <a href="/wiki/Secret_Service.html" title="Secret Service">Secret Service</a> are noted as well-trained and apolitical protective forces--although there is still the slight possibility of infilitration by an assassin. Disloyal protectors continue to be a problem in developing nations, however; <a href="/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_India.html" title="Prime Minister of India">Indian Prime Minister</a> <a href="/wiki/Indira_Gandhi.html" title="Indira Gandhi">Indira Gandhi</a> met such an end in 1984.</p>
<p>The race was on with the Middle Ages between leaders and assassins as gunpowder became predominant, each in turn trying to develop stronger and better checks against the increasing abilities of the other. One of the first reactions was to simply increase the guard, creating what at times might seem a <a href="/wiki/Brigade.html" title="Brigade">small army</a> trailing every leader; another was to begin clearing large areas whenever a leader was present, to the point where entire sections of a city might be shut down. Heads of state began to cease taking their armies onto the field personally around this time as well, although this was likely as much due to the increasing skills required for generalship and division of power within the government as it was for safety concerns.</p>
<p>As the 20th century dawned, the prevalence of assassins and their capabilities skyrocketed, and so did measures to protect against them. For the first time, <a href="/wiki/Armored_car.html" title="Armored car">armored cars</a> or <a href="/wiki/Armored_limousine.html" title="Armored limousine">armored limousines</a> were put into service for safer transport, with modern versions rendering them virtually invulnerable to <a href="/wiki/Small_arms.html" title="Small arms">small arms</a> fire. <a href="/wiki/Bulletproof_vest.html" title="Bulletproof vest">Bulletproof vests</a> were also commissioned, though not often used for political reasons. Access to famous persons, too, became more and more restrictive; potential visitors would be forced through dozens of different checks and double-checks before being granted access to the official in question, and as <a href="/wiki/Communication.html" title="Communication">communication</a> became better and <a href="/wiki/Information_technology.html" title="Information technology">information technology</a> more prevalent, it has become next-to-impossible for a would-be killer to get close enough to the personage at work to effect an attempt on his or her life, especially given the common use of <a href="/wiki/Metal_detector.html" title="Metal detector">metal</a> and <a  class="new" title="Bomb detector">bomb detectors</a>. Most modern assassinations have been committed either during a public performance or during <a href="/wiki/Transport.html" title="Transport">transport</a>, both due to weaker security and security lapses, such as with US <a href="/wiki/President_of_the_United_States.html" title="President of the United States">President</a> <a href="/wiki/John_F._Kennedy.html" title="John F. Kennedy">John F. Kennedy</a> or as part of <a href="/wiki/Coup_d%27%C3%A9tat.html" title="Coup d'état">coups d'état</a> where security is either overwhelmed or completely removed, such as with <a href="/wiki/Patrice_Lumumba.html" title="Patrice Lumumba">Patrice Lumumba</a> and possibly also <a href="/wiki/Salvador_Allende.html" title="Salvador Allende">Salvador Allende</a>.</p>
<p>Some of the wilder and arguably stranger methods used for protection by famous people of both today and yesterday have evoked many reactions from different people, some resenting the separation from their officials or major figures, some comforted by the security and some lamenting the state of society that such measures are necessary. One example might be traveling in a car protected by a bubble of clear <a href="/wiki/Bulletproof_glass.html" title="Bulletproof glass">bulletproof glass</a>, such as the <a href="/wiki/Popemobile.html" title="Popemobile">Popemobile</a> of <a href="/wiki/Pope.html" title="Pope">Pope</a> <a href="/wiki/Pope_John_Paul_II.html" title="Pope John Paul II">John Paul II</a> (built following an extremist's attempt at his life). <a href="/wiki/Friedrich_Wilhelm_I_of_Prussia.html" title="Friedrich Wilhelm I of Prussia">Frederick William I of Prussia</a> had an entire command of soldiers above two <a href="/wiki/Meters.html" title="Meters">meters</a> of height, and would reportedly go to great lengths to obtain more. Many leaders, such as <a href="/wiki/Josef_Stalin.html" title="Josef Stalin">Josef Stalin</a> or the Argentinean <a href="/wiki/Military_dictatorship.html" title="Military dictatorship">junta</a> were so possessed by paranoia that they executed their opponents <i>en masse</i>, with the death toll ranging from hundreds to millions. Of course, it could be argued that doing as Stalin did--murdering hundreds of fellow Communist Pary members and millions of Russian civilians--might increase the risk of being assassinated in the long run--although the fear generated by Stalin's Purges may deter some. It is today believed that Stalin was indeed killed by assassination, the assassin being his chief of security, Lavrentiy Beria</p>
<p>Still others go into seclusion, rarely heard from or seen in public afterwards, such as <a href="/wiki/Writer.html" title="Writer">writer</a> <a href="/wiki/Salman_Rushdie.html" title="Salman Rushdie">Salman Rushdie</a> or eccentric <a href="/wiki/Inventor.html" title="Inventor">inventor</a> <a href="/wiki/Howard_Hughes.html" title="Howard Hughes">Howard Hughes</a>, though it is more likely that Hughes was concerned about <a href="/wiki/Germ.html" title="Germ">germs</a> than about assassination. A more exotic form of protection is the use of a body double. A body double in this case is a person who is built similar to the person he is expected to protect and made up to look like him. The body double then takes the place of the person in high risk situations. Fidel Castro, Adolf Hitler and Saddam Hussein are known to have used <a href="/wiki/Political_decoy.html" title="Political decoy">body doubles</a>.</p>
<p>It is important to note that, in the final analysis, it is thought by many that if a person or group is committed beyond <a href="/wiki/Reason.html" title="Reason">reason</a> or concerns for self-preservation towards the removal of a certain person or leader from not only their position but this plane of existence, then the chances are better than fair that any security measures taken will come to naught. The <a href="/wiki/Ninja.html" title="Ninja">ninja</a> of Japan and <a href="/wiki/Suicide_bombers.html" title="Suicide bombers">suicide attackers</a> are both groups known for pursuing every avenue for however long necessary to accomplish their 'hit'. Often, such people or groups would <a href="/wiki/Suicide.html" title="Suicide">operate without concern for their own life</a> in order to gain the slightest chance of eliminating their mark. Certain leaders, notably <a href="/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln.html" title="Abraham Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a>, were thought to have wrestled with this supposed inevitability during difficult times (with some, like Lincoln's, proving prophetic). In the end it comes down to will - if the will of the would-be assassins to execute their target surpasses that of their security to save them, or the will of the targeted person to survive, then success for a killer may be a matter of time.</p>
