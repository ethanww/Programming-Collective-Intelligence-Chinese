			<p>The <b>H-1B visa</b> is a US Government program that allows <a href="/wiki/United_States.html" title="United States">American</a> companies and universities to employ foreign <a href="/wiki/Scientist.html" title="Scientist">scientists</a>, <a href="/wiki/Engineer.html" title="Engineer">engineers</a>, <a href="/wiki/Programmer.html" title="Programmer">programmers</a>, and other professionals in the United States. The program is generally thought of as a visa for high tech workers because roughly half are granted to technology-related workers. H-1Bs are used by a wide variety of professionals including several in fields suffering alleged <a href="/wiki/Labor_shortage.html" title="Labor shortage">labor shortages</a> like medical doctors, school teachers, pharmacists and even jobs on Wall Street.</p>
<p>Advocates say the program (and similar ones operated by other technologically-advanced countries) helps the host country maintain its technological as well as economic superiority by providing a steady flow of highly skilled professionals who may be short in supply domestically. It also provides an incentive for companies not to move their operations abroad. However, the program has been criticized domestically for displacing substantial numbers of experienced American citizen technical professionals or lowering wages enough to encourage them to abandon volatile careers in targeted fields such as computer technology. Economist <a href="/wiki/Milton_Friedman.html" title="Milton Friedman">Milton Friedman</a> has called the program a form of subsidy.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a  title="">[1]</a></sup> It was also blamed for encouraging <a href="/wiki/Brain_drain.html" title="Brain drain">brain drain</a> in the source countries.

<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Taxation status of H-1B workers">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Taxation_status_of_H-1B_workers" id="Taxation_status_of_H-1B_workers"></a></p>
<h2>Taxation status of H-1B workers</h2>
<p>H-1B workers are legally required to pay the same taxes as any other US resident, including Social Security and Medicare.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a  title="">[2]</a></sup> Any person who spends more than 183 days in the US in a calendar year is a tax resident and is required to pay US taxes on their worldwide income. From the IRS perspective, it doesn't matter if that income is paid in the US or elsewhere. If an H-1B worker is given a living allowance, it is treated the same by the IRS as any other US resident. In some cases, H-1B workers pay higher taxes than a US citizen because they are not entitled to certain deductions (eg. head of household deduction amongst many others). H-1B workers are also not eligible to receive any Social Security or Medicare benefits unless they retire in the US, unless they are able to adjust status and obtain green cards.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a  title="">[3]</a></sup> Although the H1-B program is often presented as providing "temporary" workers, in reality the program now allows dual intent and H1-Bs are eligible to adjust status to permanent residency if they can find an employer willing to sponsor them. Most do. In such cases, H1-Bs are eligible to receive Social Security and Medicare benefits. Furthermore, IF their homelands have totalization agreements with the United States, they are able to collect on the Social Security they've earned even if they don't gain permanent residency here. Such agreements are negotiated between the United States and other countries, typically those which have comparable standards of living and pubic retirement systems.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: H-1B employment">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="H-1B_employment" id="H-1B_employment"></a></p>
<h2>H-1B employment</h2>
<p>According to the USCIS, <i>"H-1B aliens may only work for the petitioning U.S. employer and only in the H-1B activities described in the petition. The petitioning U.S. employer may place the H-1B worker on the worksite of another employer if all applicable rules (e.g., Department of Labor rules) are followed. H-1B aliens may work for more than one U.S. employer, but must have a Form I-129 petition approved by each employer."</i><sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a  title="">[4]</a></sup> Enforcement of these rules depends upon the employee, however. The Department of Labor has neither the authority nor the manpower to investigate violations of these rules unless and until a complaint is made.</p>
<p>As the rules are written, there is no requirement that an American be sought to fill a position, nor given preference in layoffs unless the company is "H1-B dependent", i.e. 15 percent or more of its global workforce consists of H1-Bs. The employer is only required to "attest" that he was not able to find an American.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: US policy on maximum duration">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="US_policy_on_maximum_duration" id="US_policy_on_maximum_duration"></a></p>
<h2>US policy on maximum duration</h2>
<p>In theory, the maximum duration of the H-1B visa is six years (ten years for exceptional <a href="/wiki/Defense_Department.html" title="Defense Department">Defense Department</a> project-related work). H-1B holders who want to continue to work in the U.S. after six years, but who have not obtained permanent residency status, must remain outside of the U.S. for one year before reapplying for another H-1B visa.</p>
<p>There are generally two exceptions to the 6 year duration of the H-1B visa:</p>
<ul>
<li>If a visa holder has submitted an I-140 immigrant petition or a labor certification prior to his 5th year anniversary of having the H-1B visa, he is entitled to renew his H-1B visa in 1 year increments until a decision has been rendered on his application for permanent residence.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>If the visa holder has an <i>approved</i> I-140 immigrant petition, but is unable to initiate the final step of the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Permanent_Resident_Card.html" title="United States Permanent Resident Card">green card</a> process due to his <a href="/wiki/Priority_date.html" title="Priority date">priority date</a> not being current, he may be entitled to a 3 year extension of his H-1B visa. This exception originated with the American Competitiveness in the Twenty-First Century Act of 2000.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a  title="">[5]</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Quotas and changes in quotas">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Quotas_and_changes_in_quotas" id="Quotas_and_changes_in_quotas"></a></p>
<h2>Quotas and changes in quotas</h2>
<p>The number of new H-1Bs issued each year in the United States is subject to an annual congressionally-mandated quota. Those beneficiaries not subject to the annual quota are those who currently hold H-1B status or have held H-1B status at some point in the past six years and have not been outside the United States for more than 365 consecutive days. This annual quota has had a significant impact on the <a href="/wiki/High_tech.html" title="High tech">high tech</a> industry. It has generally been set at 65,000 visas per year, with some exceptions for workers at exempt organizations like universities and nonprofits. In 2000, Congress permanently exempted H-1B visas going to Universities and Government Research Laboratories from the quota. During the early years of this quota in the early 1990s, this quota was rarely actually reached. By the mid-1990s, however, the quota tended to be filled each year on a first come, first served basis, resulting in new H-1Bs often being denied or delayed because the annual quota was already filled. In response to the very hot high-tech market of the late 1990s, the quota was increased first to 130,000 and then, in 2000, to 195,000 visas per year. This increase in the quota seemed to play a role in oversaturating an already softening high-tech job market. During the years the quota was 195,000, it was never reached, and the availability of high-tech jobs in the USA plummeted as there was just too much competition for positions.</p>
<p>In 2005, the quota reverted to 90,000 when the temporary increase passed by Congress in 1999 expired. Since then, the quota is again filling up rapidly every year, making H-1Bs again increasingly hard to get. More recently, the basic quota was left at 65,000 but with an additional 20,000 visas possible for foreign workers with US advanced degrees. Of the 65,000 total, 6,800 are initially reserved for citizens of <a href="/wiki/Chile.html" title="Chile">Chile</a> and <a href="/wiki/Singapore.html" title="Singapore">Singapore</a> under free trade agreements with those countries, however, if these reserved visas are not used under the agreements, they go back to the general pool. Outside of the 65,000 quota, another 10,500 visas annually are available to <a href="/wiki/Australian.html" title="Australian">Australian</a> citizens under a similar but more flexible program, the <a href="/wiki/E-3_visa.html" title="E-3 visa">E-3 visa</a> program.</p>
<p>In 2006, the entire quota of visas for the year beginning <a href="/wiki/October_1.html" title="October 1">October 1</a>, 2006 was exhausted within a span of less than 2 months on <a href="/wiki/May_26.html" title="May 26">May 26</a><sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a  title="">[6]</a></sup>, and the additional 20,000 Advanced Degree H-1B visas were exhausted on July 26th.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Controversies and criticisms">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Controversies_and_criticisms" id="Controversies_and_criticisms"></a></p>
<h2>Controversies and criticisms</h2>
<p>In theory the H-1B program should be relatively noncontroversial. However, the implementation has caused a number of criticisms.</p>
<p>The biggest criticism of the H-1B program has been over its role in replacing U.S. workers. The first documented cases occurred in 1994 when AIG (Livington NJ) and SeaLand (Elizabeth NJ), took advantage of a loophole in the law to replace their U.S. programming staffs with H-1B workers. These companies used contract job shops to supply the H-1B replacements. The companies could claim they did not apply for H-1B visas and the job shops could claim they had not fired any U.S. workers. Thus, the employer could openly and legally replace their U.S. workforce with H-1B workers.</p>
<p>The American Competitiveness Act of 1998 that temporarily expanded the H-1B program contained a provision to close this loophole in the version that passed the House Judiciary Committee. However, the House leadership had it removed before the bill came to a vote.</p>
<p>Another criticism of the H-1B program is its vague eligibility requirements, however specific guidelines upheld by a body of case law define the requirements. While frequently described as a program for "highly skilled" workers, the H-1B nonimmigrant visa category specifically applies to specialty occupations.</p>
<p>Specialty occupations have been defined as positions that require theoretical or technical expertise in a specialized field and have generally been interpreted as being those that normally require the attainment of a Bachelor's degree. <sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a  title="">[7]</a></sup> Typical H-1B occupations include architects, engineers, computer programmers, accountants, doctors and college professors. The H-1B visa program also includes fashion models.</p>
<p>One of the unintended consequences of the H-1B program was the creation of the business of importing H-1B workers. Among the users of the H-1B program are contract job shops that import H-1B workers, then contract them out to other companies. Instead of being used to fill jobs where U.S. workers are unavailable, these contract workers are in direct competition for jobs.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a  title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>Wage depression is another complaint about the H-1B program. Many studies have found that H-1B workers are paid significantly less than U.S. workers.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a  title="">[9]</a></sup> It is claimed that the H-1B program is primarily used as a source of cheap labor. The Labor Condition Application (LCA) included in the H-1B petition is supposed to ensure that H-1B workers are paid the prevailing wage in the labor market, or the employer's actual average wage, whichever is higher, but some evidence exists that some employers do not abide by these provisions and therefore avoid paying the actual prevailing wage.</p>
<p>Historically, H-1B holders have sometimes been described as <a href="/wiki/Indentured_servants.html" title="Indentured servants">indentured servants</a>, and while the comparison is not entirely accurate, it had some validity prior to the passage of American Competitiveness in the Twenty-First Century Act of 2000. Although the USA generally requires short- and long-term visitors to disavow any ambition to seek the green card (permanent residency), H-1B visa holders are an important exception, in that the H-1B may legally and openly be used as a stepping stone to the green card under what is called the doctrine of <a href="/wiki/Dual_intent.html" title="Dual intent">dual intent</a>.</p>
<p>H-1B visa holders must generally (with some exceptions) be sponsored for their green cards by their employers. In the past, the sponsorship process has taken several years, and for much of that time the H-1B visa holder was unable to change jobs without losing their place in line for the green card. This created an element of enforced loyalty to an employer on the part of an H-1B visa holder. Critics alleged that employers liked this enforced loyalty because it reduced the risk of the H-1B employee leaving to go work for a competitor, and put American citizens at a disadvantage in the job market, because the employer had less assurance that the U.S. citizen will stay at their job for an extended period of time.</p>
<p>Employers cannot typically sue H-1B holders if they leave under US labor laws, regardless of whether the employee is an H-1B holder, a permanent resident or a US citizen. Although any employer can make this threat, the case history of employers who have attempted to sue or otherwise claim money from H-1B employees is limited. In 2001, San Mateo County Superior Court Judge Phrasel Shelton ruled in an H-1B employee's favor on the unfair competition statute and ordered the employer to drop restrictive language in its employee contracts. The H-1B employee in the case was awarded over $200,000 in fees and damages.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a  title="">[10]</a></sup> In 2002 the employer appealed the decision and lost.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a  title="">[11]</a></sup> In addition, Department of Labor's H-1B regulations issued in 2001 prohibit employers from making an H-1B employee pay a penalty for quitting prior to an agreed upon date.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Spot Shortages are Allegedly Necessary">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Spot_Shortages_are_Allegedly_Necessary" id="Spot_Shortages_are_Allegedly_Necessary"></a></p>
<h3>Spot Shortages are Allegedly Necessary</h3>
<p>One complaint that has been difficult to quantify is the use of H-1B workers to avoid waiting for the training or learning curve of citizens. Technology workers often describe how technology trends result in demand for specific skills waxing and waning at an unpredictable pace. This leaves spot surpluses and spot shortages.</p>
<p>A citizen technology worker allegedly needs the spot shortages to give companies an incentive to let them transfer into the spot shortage jobs from surplus jobs. A company would have to allow a learning curve for the transition to take place. However, if the employer could instead comb the world for somebody with a specific desired skill, then they may bypass citizens trying to transfer from surplus areas to shortage areas. This would leave the citizen unemployed or under-employed. It could lead to a condition whereby there are <i>both</i> unemployment and spot shortages in a given field.</p>
<p>Critics will argue that the citizen should obtain training on his own time or during unemployment. However, one may end up targeting a specialty not needed by a particular company in their area. It may be more efficient to train for actual, known positions than to try to predict an industry-wide need. The pattern of shortages or surpluses may have also changed during the training period. Rapid skill requirements changes are common in the technology fields. <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.geocities.com/tablizer/multiskills.htm">[2]</a></p>

<h3>Programmer's Guild Allegations and Lawsuits</h3>
<p>The Programmer's Guild is a labor and trade association that is known to criticize visa programs for skilled workers. Some of the allegations and lawsuits they have brought include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a  class="external text" title="http://infoworld.com/article/06/06/22/79563_HNtechworkerh1b_1.html">A lawsuit</a> claiming that H-1B job ads are discriminating against citizens by requesting only H-1B workers.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><a  class="external text" title="http://www.workpermit.com/news/2005_10_26/us/us_h1b_visa_holders_earn_less.htm">A study</a> suggesting that on the average H-1B visa workers are being paid $13,000 less than comparable citizens. (The H-1B program requires "prevailing wages".)</li>
</ul>
<p>Suggestions made by the Programmer's Guild and similar organizations include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Better monitoring of complaints and unemployment levels by a government-appointed administrator, similar to the role that <a href="/wiki/Alan_Greenspan.html" title="Alan Greenspan">Alan Greenspan</a> performed for monetary policy. This would allow quicker response to recessions, bubbles, and other economic changes.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Better public disclosure of current and past visa requests and applications, including a web-site with PDF's of all visa requests. This would give citizens a chance to also apply, know what skills are in demand, and know who is hiring.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Dedicated, full-time inspectors of visa worker wages and skills performed. The current system only acts if there are specific complaints.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The ability of an unemployed citizen to demand an existing visa worker's position if qualified. (Perhaps with a 3-month window to allow for company transition procedures.)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Require reciprocal visa issuance practices by the foreign worker's country. The other country should be required to allow at least an equal number of visa workers into their country from the U.S.</li>
</ul>
<p>In condidering the pros and cons of the H-1B visa, it must be remembered that the Programmer's Guild is a special interest group that supports its own agenda, and that the points of view and statistics offered may be challenged by groups or persons with a contrary point of view. However, it should be noted that most parties involved in this complex issue could qualify as "special interest groups".</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Worker Protection and Law Enforcement">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Worker_Protection_and_Law_Enforcement" id="Worker_Protection_and_Law_Enforcement"></a></p>
<h2>Worker Protection and Law Enforcement</h2>
<p>For every H-1B petition filed with the USCIS, there must be included a Labor Condition Application (LCA) certified by the U.S. Department of Labor. The LCA is designed to ensure that the wage offered to the non-immigrant worker must meet or exceed the prevailing wage in the area of employment. The LCA also contains an attestation section designed to prevent the program from being used to import foreign workers for the purpose of breaking a strike, or for the purpose of replacing US citizen workers. Under the regulations, LCAs are a matter of public record. Corporations hiring H-1B workers are required to make these records available to any member of the public who requests to look at them. Copies of the relevant records are also available from various web sites, including the Department of Labor.</p>
<p>At a high level, the LCA process appears to offer protection to both U.S. and H-1B workers. According to the US General Accunting Office the details of law render these protections ineffective.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a  title="">[12]</a></sup> The employer ultimately, not the Department of Labor, however, determines what source it will use to determine the prevailing wage for an offered position, and it may choose among a variety of competing surveys, including its own wage surveys, provided that such surveys follow certain defined rules and regulations.</p>
<p>The law specifically restricts the Department of Labor's approval process of LCAs to checking for "completeness and obvious inaccuracies".<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a  title="">[13]</a></sup>. In FY 2005, only about 800 LCAs were rejected out of over 300,000 submitted.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Recent changes to US law">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Recent_changes_to_US_law" id="Recent_changes_to_US_law"></a></p>
<h2>Recent changes to US law</h2>
<p>The American Competitiveness in the Twenty-First Century Act of 2000 (AC21)and the Department of Labor's PERM system for labor certification erased most of the earlier claimed arguments for H-1B's as indentured servants during the green card process. With PERM, labor certification processing times have been reduced to less than 90 days.</p>
<p>Because of AC21, the H-1B employee is free to change jobs if they have an I-485 application pending for six months and an approved I-140, if the position to which they are moving is substantially comparable to their current position. In some cases, if those <a href="/wiki/Labor_certifications.html" title="Labor certifications">labor certifications</a> are withdrawn and replaced with PERM applications, processing times will improve, but the person will also lose their favorable <a href="/wiki/Priority_date.html" title="Priority date">priority date</a>. In those cases, employers' incentive to attempt to lock in H-1B employees to a job by offering a green card is reduced, because the employer bears the high legal costs and fees associated with labor certification and I-140 processing, but the H-1B employee is still free to change jobs.</p>
<p>However, many people are ineligible to file I-485 at the current time due to the wide-spread retrogression in priority dates. Thus, they may well still be stuck with their sponsoring employer for many years. There are also many old <a href="/wiki/Labor_certification.html" title="Labor certification">labor certification</a> cases pending under pre-PERM rules.</p>
<p>On May 25, 2006 the senate passed immigration bill 2611 which would increase the number of H1-B visas from the current level of 65,000 to 115,000 annually with a potential automatic yearly increase of 20%. This legislation must still pass the House to become law. <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ieeeusa.org/policy/issues/H1bvisa/index.html">[3]</a> <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=109&amp;session=2&amp;vote=00157">[4]</a> <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://news.zdnet.com/5208-3513-0.html?forumID=1&amp;threadID=19462&amp;messageID=375504&amp;start=-1">[5]</a></p>

<h2>Similar Programs</h2>
<p>In addition to H-1B visas, there are a variety of other visa categories which allow foreign workers to come into the US to work for some period of time.</p>
<p>L-1 visas are issued to foreign employees of a corporation. Under recent rules, the foreign worker must have worked for the corporation for at least one year in the preceding three years prior to getting the visa. An L-1B visa is appropriate for nonimmigrant workers who are being temporarily transferred to the United States based on their specialized knowledge of the company's proprietary methodologies. An L-1A visa is for managers or executives who will either manage people or an essential function of the company. There is no requirement to pay prevailing wages for the L-1 visa holders. For Canadian residents, a special L visa category is available.</p>
<p>TN-1 visas are part of the NAFTA treaty, and are issued to Canadian and Mexican citizens.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a  title="">[14]</a></sup> Formerly, they were also issued to third country citizens who had obtained permanent residency in Canada. This procedure is called "touching base". TN visas are only available to workers who fall into one of a pre-set list of occupations determined by the NAFTA treaty.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/E-3_visa.html" title="E-3 visa">E-3 visas</a> are issued to citizens of Australia under the Australia free-trade treaty.</p>
<p>H-1B1 visas are issued to residents of Chile and Singapore under the amended NAFTA treaty.</p>
<p>One recent trend in work visas is that various countries attempt to get special preference for their nationals as part of treaty negotiations. Another trend is for changes in immigration law to be embedded in large Authorization or Omnibus bills to avoid the controversy that might accompany a separate vote.</p>
