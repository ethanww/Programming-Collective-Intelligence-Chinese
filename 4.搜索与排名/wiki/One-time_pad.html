Excerpt from a one-time pad.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/Cryptography.html" title="Cryptography">cryptography</a>, the <b>one-time pad (OTP)</b> is an <a href="/wiki/Encryption.html" title="Encryption">encryption</a> algorithm where the <a href="/wiki/Plaintext.html" title="Plaintext">plaintext</a> is combined with a random <a href="/wiki/Key_%28cryptography%29.html" title="Key (cryptography)">key</a> or <i>"pad"</i> that is as long as the plaintext and used only once. It was invented in <a href="/wiki/1917.html" title="1917">1917</a>. If the key is truly <a href="/wiki/Random.html" title="Random">random</a>, never reused, and (of course) kept <a href="/wiki/Secret.html" title="Secret">secret</a>, the one-time pad can be proven to be unbreakable. The key normally consists of a random stream of numbers, each of which indicates the number of places in the alphabet (or number stream, if the plaintext message is in numerical form) which the corresponding letter or number in the plaintext message should be shifted. For messages in the Latin alphabet, for example, the key will consist of a random string of numbers from 0 to 25; for digital messages the key will consist of a random string of 0s and 1s; and so on.</p>
<p>The "pad" part of the name comes from early implementations where the key material was distributed as a pad of paper, so the top sheet could be easily torn off and destroyed after use. For easy concealment, the pad was sometimes physically very small. Photos accessible on the Internet show captured <a href="/wiki/KGB.html" title="KGB">KGB</a> pads that fit in the palm of one's hand <sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a  title="">[1]</a></sup>, or in a <a href="/wiki/Walnut.html" title="Walnut">walnut</a> shell. <sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a  title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>The one-time pad is derived from the <a href="/wiki/Vernam_cipher.html" title="Vernam cipher">Vernam cipher</a>, named after <a href="/wiki/Gilbert_Vernam.html" title="Gilbert Vernam">Gilbert Vernam</a>, one of its inventors. Vernam's system was a cipher that combined a message with a key read from a <a href="/wiki/Paper_tape.html" title="Paper tape">paper tape</a> loop. In its original form, Vernam's system was not unbreakable because the key could be reused. One-time use came a little later when <a href="/wiki/Joseph_Mauborgne.html" title="Joseph Mauborgne">Joseph Mauborgne</a> recognized that if the key tape was totally random, <a href="/wiki/Cryptanalysis.html" title="Cryptanalysis">cryptanalytic</a> difficulty would be increased.</p>
<p>There is some term ambiguity due to the fact that some authors use the term "Vernam cipher" synonymously for the "one-time-pad", while others refer to any additive <a href="/wiki/Stream_cipher.html" title="Stream cipher">stream cipher</a> as a "Vernam cipher", including those based on a <a href="/wiki/Cryptographically_secure_pseudorandom_number_generator.html" title="Cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator">cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator</a> (CSPRNG). <sup id="_ref-kahn_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[3]</a></sup></p>

<h2>Perfect secrecy</h2>
<p>The Vernam-Mauborgne one-time pad was recognized early on as very difficult to break, but its special status was only realized by <a href="/wiki/Claude_Shannon.html" title="Claude Shannon">Claude Shannon</a> some 25 years later. He proved, using <a href="/wiki/Information_theory.html" title="Information theory">information theory</a> considerations, that the one-time pad has a property he termed <i>perfect secrecy</i>: that is, the ciphertext gives absolutely no additional <a href="/wiki/Information.html" title="Information">information</a> about the <a href="/wiki/Plaintext.html" title="Plaintext">plaintext</a>. Thus, the <i><a href="/wiki/A_priori.html" title="A priori">a priori</a></i> probability of a plaintext message <i>M</i> is the same as the <i><a href="/wiki/Empirical_knowledge.html" title="Empirical knowledge">a posteriori</a></i> probability of a plaintext message <i>M</i> given the corresponding ciphertext. And in fact all plaintexts are equally probable. This is a strong notion of cryptanalytic difficulty. <sup id="_ref-shannon_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>Despite Shannon's proof of its security, the one-time pad has serious drawbacks in practice:</p>
<ul>
<li>it requires perfectly random one-time pads</li>
<li>secure generation and exchange of the one-time pad material, which must be at least as long as the message</li>
<li>careful treatment to make sure that it forever remains secret from any adversary, and is disposed of correctly preventing any reuse in whole or part — hence "one time". See <a href="/wiki/Data_remanence.html" title="Data remanence">data remanence</a> for a discussion of difficulties in completely erasing computer media.</li>
</ul>
<p>These implementational difficulties have led to one-time pad systems being broken, and are so serious that they have prevented the one-time pad from being adopted as a widespread tool in <a href="/wiki/Information_security.html" title="Information security">information security</a>.</p>
<p>In particular, one-time use is absolutely necessary. If a one-time pad is used just twice, simple mathematical operations can reduce it to a <a href="/wiki/Running-key_cipher.html" title="Running-key cipher">running-key cipher</a>. If both plaintexts are in a natural language (e.g. English or Russian), even though both are secret, each stands a very high chance of being recovered by <a href="/wiki/Heuristic.html" title="Heuristic">heuristic</a> cryptanalysis, with possibly a few ambiguities. Of course the longer message can only be broken for the portion that overlaps the shorter message, plus, perhaps, a little more by completing a word or phrase. The most famous exploit of this vulnerability is the <a href="/wiki/VENONA_project.html" title="VENONA project">VENONA project</a>. <sup id="_ref-nsa_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>The one time pad does not provide any mechanism to ensure message integrity, and in theory a <a href="/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack.html" title="Man-in-the-middle attack">man-in-the-middle attacker</a> who knows the exact message being sent can straightforwardly replace all or part of that message with text of their choosing that is the same length. Standard techniques to prevent this, such as the use of a <a href="/wiki/Message_authentication_code.html" title="Message authentication code">message authentication code</a>, can be used along with a one-time pad system, but they lack the perfect security that OTP enjoys.</p>

<h3>Technical development</h3>
<p>The history of the one-time pad is marked by four separate but closely related discoveries.</p>
<p>The first one-time pad system was electrical. In <a href="/wiki/1917.html" title="1917">1917</a>, <a href="/wiki/Gilbert_Vernam.html" title="Gilbert Vernam">Gilbert Vernam</a> (of <a href="/wiki/AT%26T.html" title="AT&amp;T">AT&amp;T</a>) invented and later patented (<a  class="external text" title="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?patentnumber=1,310,719">U.S. Patent 1,310,719</a>) a cipher based on <a href="/wiki/Teletype.html" title="Teletype">teletype</a> machine technology. Each character in a message was electrically combined with a character on a <a href="/wiki/Paper_tape.html" title="Paper tape">paper tape</a> key. Captain <a href="/wiki/Joseph_Mauborgne.html" title="Joseph Mauborgne">Joseph Mauborgne</a> (then a captain in the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Army.html" title="United States Army">United States Army</a> and later chief of the <a href="/wiki/Signal_Corps.html" title="Signal Corps">Signal Corps</a>) recognized that the character sequence on the key tape could be completely random and that, if so, cryptanalysis would be more difficult. Together they invented the first one-time tape system. <sup id="_ref-kahn_1" class="reference"><a  title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>The second development was the paper pad system. Diplomats had long used <a href="/wiki/Code.html" title="Code">codes</a> and <a href="/wiki/Cipher.html" title="Cipher">ciphers</a> for confidentiality and to minimize <a href="/wiki/Telegraphy.html" title="Telegraphy">telegraph</a> costs. For the codes, words and phrases were converted to groups of numbers (typically 4 or 5 digits) using a dictionary-like <a href="/wiki/Codebook.html" title="Codebook">codebook</a>. For added security, secret numbers could be combined with (usually modular addition) each code group before transmission, with the secret numbers being changed periodically (this was called superencryption). In the early <a href="/wiki/1920s.html" title="1920s">1920s</a>, three German cryptographers, Werner Kunze, Rudolf Schauffler and Erich Langlotz, who were involved in breaking such systems, realized that they could never be broken if a separate randomly chosen additive number was used for every code group. They had duplicate paper pads printed up with lines of random number groups. Each page had a serial number and eight lines. Each line had six 5-digit numbers. A page would be used as a work sheet to encode a message and then destroyed. The serial number of the page would be sent with the encoded message. The recipient would reverse the procedure and then destroy his copy of the page. The German foreign office put this system into operation by <a href="/wiki/1923.html" title="1923">1923</a>. <sup id="_ref-kahn_2" class="reference"><a  title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>A separate notion was the use of a one-time pad of letters to encode plaintext directly as in the example below. <a href="/wiki/Leo_Marks.html" title="Leo Marks">Leo Marks</a> describes inventing such a system for the British <a href="/wiki/Special_Operations_Executive.html" title="Special Operations Executive">Special Operations Executive</a> during <a href="/wiki/World_War_II.html" title="World War II">World War II</a>, though he suspected at the time that it was already known in the highly compartmentalized world of cryptography, as for instance at <a href="/wiki/Bletchley_Park.html" title="Bletchley Park">Bletchley Park</a>. <sup id="_ref-marks_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>The final discovery was by <a href="/wiki/Claude_Shannon.html" title="Claude Shannon">Claude Shannon</a> in the <a href="/wiki/1940s.html" title="1940s">1940s</a> who recognized and proved the theoretical significance of the one-time pad system.<sup id="_ref-shannon_1" class="reference"><a  title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Example">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Example" id="Example"></a></p>
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>Suppose <a href="/wiki/Alice_and_Bob.html" title="Alice and Bob">Alice</a> wishes to send the message 'HELLO' to <a href="/wiki/Alice_and_Bob.html" title="Alice and Bob">Bob</a>. Assume two pads of paper containing identical random sequences of letters were somehow previously produced and securely issued to both. Alice chooses the appropriate unused page from the pad. The way to do this is normally arranged for in advance, as for instance 'use the 12th sheet on Labor Day', or 'use the next available sheet for the next message'. The material on the selected sheet is the <i>key</i> for this message. Each letter from the pad will be combined in a predetermined way with one letter of the message. It is common, but not required, to assign each letter a numerical value: e.g., "A" is 0, "B" is 1, and so on through "Z", 25. In this example, the technique is to combine the key and the message using <a href="/wiki/Modular_arithmetic.html" title="Modular arithmetic">modular addition</a>. The numerical values of corresponding message and key letters are added together, modulo 26. If key material begins with,</p>
<pre>
X M C K L
</pre>
<p>and the message is "HELLO", then the coding would be done as follows:</p>
<pre>
  23 (X)  12 (M)   2 (C)  10 (K)  11 (L) key
+  7 (H)   4 (E)  11 (L)  11 (L)  14 (O) message
= 30      16      13      21      25     key + message
=  4 (E)  16 (Q)  13 (N)  21 (V)  25 (Z) key + message (mod 26)
</pre>
<p>Note that if a number is larger than 25, then in modular arithmetic fashion, 26 would be subtracted from the number to make it less than 26.</p>
<p>The ciphertext to be sent to Bob is thus "EQNVZ." Bob uses the matching key page and the same process, but in reverse, to obtain the <a href="/wiki/Plaintext.html" title="Plaintext">plaintext</a>. Here, the key is <i>subtracted</i> from the ciphertext, again using modular arithmetic:</p>
<pre>
    4 (E)  16 (Q)  13 (N)  21 (V)  25 (Z) ciphertext
-  23 (X)  12 (M)   2 (C)  10 (K)  11 (L) key
= -19       4      11      11      14     ciphertext - key
=   7 (H)   4 (E)  11 (L)  11 (L)  14 (O) ciphertext - key (mod 26)
</pre>
<p>Similar to above, if a number is negative, 26 is added to make the number nonnegative.</p>
<p>Thus, Bob recovers Alice's plaintext, the vital message "HELLO". Both Alice and Bob destroy the key sheet immediately after use, thus preventing reuse and an essentially trivial attack against the cipher. The <a href="/wiki/KGB.html" title="KGB">KGB</a> often issued its <a href="/wiki/Espionage.html" title="Espionage">agents</a> one-time pads printed on tiny sheets of "flash paper"—paper chemically converted to <a href="/wiki/Nitrocellulose.html" title="Nitrocellulose">nitrocellulose</a>, which burns almost instantly and leaves no ash.</p>
<p>The classical one-time pad of espionage (which often required actual paper pads (often minuscule for ease of concealment), a sharp pencil and the use of some <a href="/wiki/Mental_arithmetic.html" title="Mental arithmetic">mental arithmetic</a>) can be implemented as a software program using data files as input (plaintext) and output (ciphertext) and key material (the required random sequence). The <a href="/wiki/XOR.html" title="XOR">XOR</a> operation is often used to combine the plaintext and the key elements, and is especially attractive on computers since it is usually a native machine instruction and is therefore very fast. However, ensuring that the key material is actually random, is used only once, never becomes known to the opposition, and is completely destroyed after use is hard to do. The auxiliary parts of a software one-time pad implementation present real challenges: secure handling/transmission of plaintext, truly random keys, and one-time-only use of the key.</p>

<p><a name="Security" id="Security"></a></p>
<h2>Security</h2>
<p>One-time pads are "<a href="/wiki/Information_theoretic_security.html" title="Information theoretic security">information-theoretically secure</a>" in that the encrypted message (i.e., the <a href="/wiki/Ciphertext.html" title="Ciphertext">ciphertext</a>) provides no information about the original message to a <a href="/wiki/Cryptanalyst.html" title="Cryptanalyst">cryptanalyst</a>. This is a very strong notion of security first developed during WWII by <a href="/wiki/Claude_Shannon.html" title="Claude Shannon">Claude Shannon</a> and proved, mathematically, to be true of the one-time pad by Shannon about the same time. His result was published in the <i>Bell Labs Technical Journal</i> in 1949. Properly used one-time pads are secure in this sense even against adversaries with infinite computational power. To continue the example from above, suppose Eve intercepts Alice's ciphertext: "EQNVZ." If Eve had infinite computing power, she would quickly find that the key "XMCKL" would produce the plaintext "HELLO", but she would also find that the key "TQURI" would produce the plaintext "LATER", an equally plausible message:</p>
<pre>
    4 (E)  16 (Q)  13 (N)  21 (V)  25 (Z) ciphertext
−  19 (T)  16 (Q)  20 (U)  17 (R)   8 (I) possible key
= −15       0      −7       4      17     ciphertext-key
=  11 (L)   0 (A)  19 (T)   4 (E)  17 (R) ciphertext-key (mod 26)
</pre>
<p>In fact, it is possible to "decrypt" any message whatsoever with the same number of characters out of the ciphertext simply by using a different key and there is no information in the ciphertext which will allow Eve to choose amongst the various possible readings of the ciphertext.</p>
<p>Most conventional encryption algorithms both symmetric and asymmetric, use complex patterns of substitution and transpositions. For the best of these currently in use, it is not known whether there can be a cryptanalytic procedure which can reverse (or, usefully, partially reverse) these transformations without knowing the key used during encryption.</p>
<p>In practical terms, for the best of these, no such procedures are known, though there may exist computer algorithms which could do so in a 'reasonable' time. One of the central outstanding unsolved problems of computer science bears on this problem; if <a href="/wiki/Complexity_classes_P_and_NP.html" title="Complexity classes P and NP">P=NP</a> then it would be at least possible that such algorithms might be found, and they would surely be sought even more vigorously than they are today. Even if not, individual present cryptosystems might still be broken. However, the one-time pad would not be made less secure by a proof that P=NP. At present, most informed observers believe that P≠NP and, in any case, many doubt this question has any practical relevance to cryptanalysis or encryption algorithm design.</p>

Common consumer items that can be used to transport one-time pad data.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The theoretical perfect security of the one-time-pad applies only in a theoretically perfect setting; no real-world implementation of any cryptosystem can provide perfect security because practical considerations introduce potential vulnerabilities. These practical considerations of security and convenience have meant that the one-time-pad is, in practice, little-used.</p>
<ul>
<li>One-time pads solve few current practical problems in cryptography. High quality ciphers that have undergone rigorous public review are widely available and their security is not considered a major worry at present. Such ciphers are almost always easier to employ than one-time pads; the amount of key material which must be properly generated and securely distributed is far smaller, and <a href="/wiki/Public_key_cryptography.html" title="Public key cryptography">public key cryptography</a> makes the problem easier. <sup id="_ref-schneierotp_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[7]</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>High quality random numbers can be hard to generate. The random number generation functions in most <a href="/wiki/Programming_language.html" title="Programming language">programming language</a> libraries are not suitable for cryptographic use. Even those generators that are suitable for normal cryptographic use, including <a href="/wiki//dev/random.html" title="/dev/random">/dev/random</a> and many <a href="/wiki/Hardware_random_number_generator.html" title="Hardware random number generator">hardware random number generators</a>, make some use of cryptographic functions whose security is unproven.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Distributing the one-time pad keys is inconvenient. Storage media such as <a href="/wiki/Thumb_drive.html" title="Thumb drive">thumb drives</a>, <a href="/wiki/DVD-R.html" title="DVD-R">DVD-Rs</a> or personal <a href="/wiki/Digital_audio_player.html" title="Digital audio player">digital audio players</a> can be used to carry a very large one-time-pad from place to place in a non-suspicious way, but even so the need to transport the pad physically is a burden compared to the key negotiation protocols of a modern public-key cryptosystem, and these media cannot reliably be erased securely by any means short of incineration. A 4.7 GB DVD-R full of one-time-pad data, if shredded into particles 1 mm<sup>2</sup> in size, leaves over 100 kilobits of data on each particle. In addition the risk of compromise during transit (for example, a <a href="/wiki/Pickpocket.html" title="Pickpocket">pickpocket</a> swiping, copying and replacing the pad) is probably much greater in practice than the likelihood of compromise for a cipher such as <a href="/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard.html" title="Advanced Encryption Standard">AES</a>. Finally, the effort needed to manage one-time pad key material scales badly for large networks. The number of pads required goes up as the square of the number of users exchanging messages freely amongst each other. For communication between only two persons, or a <a href="/wiki/Star_network.html" title="Star network">star network</a> topology, this is somewhat less of a problem.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The key material must be securely disposed of after use, to ensure the key material is never reused and to protect the messages sent. Because the key material must be transported from one endpoint to another, and persist until the message is sent or received, it can be more vulnerable to <a href="/wiki/Computer_forensics.html" title="Computer forensics">forensic recovery</a> than the transient plaintext it protects. <i>See also:</i> <a href="/wiki/Data_remanence.html" title="Data remanence">data remanence</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>As traditionally used, one-time pads provide no <a href="/wiki/Authentication.html" title="Authentication">message authentication</a>, the lack of which is a frequent source of security failure in real-world systems. The straightforward additive keystream nature makes this vulnerability especially simple to exploit - for example, an attacker who knows that the message contains "Meet Jane and me tomorrow at 3:30 pm" at a particular point can replace that content by any other content of the exact same length, such as "3:30 meeting is cancelled, stay home", without having access to the one-time pad. <a href="/wiki/Universal_hashing.html" title="Universal hashing">Universal hashing</a> provides a way to authenticate messages up to an arbitrary security bound (i.e. for any p&gt;0, a large enough hash ensures that even a computationally unbounded attacker's likelihood of successful forgery is less than p), but this uses additional random data from the pad, and removes the possibility of implementing the system without a computer.</li>
</ul>
<p>Nonetheless, the one-time-pad retains some limited practical interest:</p>
<ul>
<li>The one-time-pad is the only cryptosystem proven secure. Though most experts have confidence in standard cryptosystems for practical purposes, one cannot be certain that a future cryptanalytic breakthrough, or a breakthrough in computer hardware such as <a href="/wiki/Quantum_computing.html" title="Quantum computing">quantum computing</a>, will not render them breakable.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The one-time-pad is one of the most practical methods of encryption where one or both parties must do all work by hand, without the aid of a computer; this made it important in the pre-computer era, and it could conceivably still be useful in situations where possession of a computer is illegal or incriminating or where trustworthy computer <a href="/wiki/Operating_system.html" title="Operating system">operating systems</a> are not available.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Making and using a one-time pad has educational value. No special equipment is required and it serves as a good introduction to several cryptographic ideas.</li>

<h2>Uses</h2>
<p>In some hypothetical espionage situations, the one-time pad might be useful because it can be computed by hand with only pencil and paper. Indeed, nearly all other high quality ciphers are entirely impractical without computers. Spies can receive their pads in person from their "handlers." In the modern world, however, computers (such as those embedded in personal electronic devices such as <a href="/wiki/Mobile_phone.html" title="Mobile phone">mobile phones</a>) are so ubiquitous that possessing a computer suitable for performing conventional encryption (for example, a phone which can run concealed cryptographic software) will usually not attract suspicion.</p>
<p>One-time pads have been used in special circumstances since the early <a href="/wiki/1900s.html" title="1900s">1900s</a>. The <a href="/wiki/Weimar_Republic.html" title="Weimar Republic">Weimar Republic</a> Diplomatic Service began using the method in about <a href="/wiki/1920.html" title="1920">1920</a>. The breaking of poor <a href="/wiki/Union_of_Soviet_Socialist_Republics.html" title="Union of Soviet Socialist Republics">Soviet</a> cryptography by the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom.html" title="United Kingdom">British</a>, with messages made public for political reasons in two instances in the <a href="/wiki/1920s.html" title="1920s">1920s</a>, appear to have induced the USSR to adopt one-time pads for some purposes by around <a href="/wiki/1930.html" title="1930">1930</a>. <a href="/wiki/KGB.html" title="KGB">KGB</a> spies are also known to have used pencil and paper one-time pads more recently. Examples include Colonel <a href="/wiki/Rudolf_Abel.html" title="Rudolf Abel">Rudolf Abel</a>, who was arrested and convicted in <a href="/wiki/New_York_City.html" title="New York City">New York City</a> in the 1950s, and the 'Krogers' (ie, Morris and Lona Cohen), who were arrested and convicted of espionage in the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom.html" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> in the early 1960s.

<h2>Exploits</h2>
<p>While one-time pads are provably secure if generated and used properly, small mistakes can lead to successful cryptanalysis:</p>
<ul>
<li>In <a href="/wiki/1944.html" title="1944">1944</a>–<a href="/wiki/1945.html" title="1945">1945</a>, the US Army's <a  class="new" title="Signal Security Agency">Signal Security Agency</a> was able to solve a one-time pad system used by the German Foreign Office for its high-level traffic, codenamed GEE (Erskine, 2001). GEE was insecure because the pads were not completely random — the machine used to generate the pads produced predictable output.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>In <a href="/wiki/1945.html" title="1945">1945</a> the U.S. discovered that <a href="/wiki/Canberra.html" title="Canberra">Canberra</a>-<a href="/wiki/Moscow.html" title="Moscow">Moscow</a> messages were being encrypted first using a code-book and then using a one-time pad. However the one-time pad used was the same one used by Moscow for <a href="/wiki/Washington%2C_DC.html" title="Washington, DC">Washington, DC</a>-Moscow messages. Combined with the fact that some of the Canberra-Moscow messages included known British government documents, this allowed some of the encrypted messages to be broken.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>One-time pads were employed by <a href="/wiki/Soviet_Union.html" title="Soviet Union">Soviet</a> espionage agencies for covert communications with agents and agent controllers. Analysis has shown that these pads were generated by typists using actual typewriters. This method is of course not "truly" random, as it makes certain convenient key sequences more likely than others, yet it proved to be generally effective. Without copies of the key material used, only some defect in the generation method or reuse of keys offered much hope of cryptanalysis. Beginning in the late <a href="/wiki/1940s.html" title="1940s">1940s</a>, U.S. and UK intelligence agencies were able to break some of the Soviet one-time pad traffic to <a href="/wiki/Moscow.html" title="Moscow">Moscow</a> during WWII as a result of errors made in generating and distributing the key material. One suggestion is that Moscow Centre personnel were somewhat rushed by the presence of German troops just outside Moscow in late 1941 and early 1942, and they produced more than one copy of same key material during that period. This decades-long effort was finally codenamed <a href="/wiki/VENONA.html" title="VENONA">VENONA</a> (BRIDE had been an earlier name); it produced a considerable amount of information, including more than a little about some of the Soviet atom spies.

<h2>True randomness requirements</h2>
<p>In discussing the one-time pad, two notions of security have to be kept distinct. The first is the theoretical security of the one-time pad system as proved by Shannon (<a href="/wiki/Shannon_security.html" title="Shannon security">Shannon security</a>). The second is the security offered by state-of-the-art ciphers (e.g. <a href="/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard.html" title="Advanced Encryption Standard">AES</a>) designed with principles learned in the long history of code breaking and subjected to extensive testing in a standardization process, either in public or by a top notch security service (<b>empirical security</b>). The former is mathematically proven, subject to the practical availability of random numbers. The later is unproven but relied upon by most governments to protect their most vital secrets (insofar as publicly known thus far).</p>

<h3>Methods that may offer empirical security, but do not have Shannon security</h3>
<p>If the key material is generated by a deterministic program, then it is not random and the encryption system cannot claim the theoretical security of the one-time pad system. Instead it is called a <a href="/wiki/Stream_cipher.html" title="Stream cipher">stream cipher</a>. These generally use a short key which is used to seed a long <a href="/wiki/Pseudorandom.html" title="Pseudorandom">pseudorandom</a> stream, which is then combined with the message using some such mechanism as those used in one-time pads (eg, XOR). Stream ciphers can be secure in practice, but they cannot be absolutely secure in the same provable sense as the one-time pad.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/FISH_%28cryptography%29.html" title="FISH (cryptography)">Fish ciphers</a> used by the German military in WWII turned out to be insecure stream ciphers, not practical automated one-time pads as their designers had intended. <a href="/wiki/Bletchley_Park.html" title="Bletchley Park">Bletchley Park</a> broke one of them, the <a href="/wiki/Lorenz_cipher.html" title="Lorenz cipher">Lorenz cipher</a> machine, regularly.</p>
<p>However, if a modern so-called <a href="/wiki/Cryptographically_secure_pseudo-random_number_generator.html" title="Cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator">cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator</a> is used, it can form the basis for an empirically secure stream cipher. There are many well-vetted designs in the public domain, ranging from the simplicity of <a href="/wiki/RC4.html" title="RC4">RC4</a> to using a <a href="/wiki/Block_cipher.html" title="Block cipher">block cipher</a> like AES in <a href="/wiki/Counter_mode.html" title="Counter mode">counter mode</a>. There would appear to be little reason to invent new stream ciphers, yet it has long been thought that NSA and its comparable agencies devote considerable effort to stream ciphers for their government customers.</p>

<h3>Methods that offer neither empirical security nor Shannon security</h3>
<p>The similarity between stream ciphers and one-time pads often leads the cryptographically unwary to invent insecure stream ciphers under the mistaken impression that they have developed a practical version of the one-time pad. An especially insecure approach is to use any of the <a href="/wiki/Pseudorandom_number_generator.html" title="Pseudorandom number generator">random number generators</a> that are distributed in many (perhaps most) computer programming language runtime support packages or as <a href="/wiki/Operating_system.html" title="Operating system">operating system</a> system calls. These typically produce sequences that pass some (or even many) <a href="/wiki/Statistics.html" title="Statistics">statistical</a> tests, but are nonetheless breakable by cryptoanalytic techniques. For some time the ANSI C standard restricted the C language random number routine output to a single precision integer, for most implementations that would be 16-bits, giving at most 32768 different values before repeating. This is entirely insecure and is easily breakable by <a href="/wiki/Brute_force_attack.html" title="Brute force attack">exhaustive test</a> (for perspective, a 1 GHz computer which takes 10,000 clock cycles to check an offset within the RNG's cycle (a ridiculously high number) would take under a third of a second to check every possible offset). Standard computer random number generators are not suitable for cryptographic purposes, specifically including the one-time pad. In particular, the relatively newly developed and widely admired <a href="/wiki/Mersenne_twister.html" title="Mersenne twister">Mersenne twister</a> algorithm, while sufficiently "random" for most research or simulation uses, better than most any other such generator, and quite fast as well, should not be used to generate one-time pad key material. The algorithm is deterministic and was not designed for cryptographic security.</p>
<p>As well, publicly known values such as the terminal digits of <a href="/wiki/Marathon_%28sport%29.html" title="Marathon (sport)">marathon</a> race times, closing stock prices from any source however obscure, daily temperatures or atmospheric pressures, etc, though seemingly random, are predictable -- after the fact. Indeed, even truly random sequences which have been published cannot be used as they are now predictable if identified. An example is the Rand Corp 1950s publication of a million random number table; it has passed every statistical test for randomness thus far and is thought to be actually random. But, having been published, it is fully predictable. So are the digits of pi, e, <a href="/wiki/Golden_ratio.html" title="Golden ratio">phi</a>, and other irrational, or transcendental, numbers; the sequences may be random (an open question, actually), but are fully predictable nonetheless.</p>

<p><a name="Achieving_Shannon_security" id="Achieving_Shannon_security"></a></p>
<h3>Achieving Shannon security</h3>
<p>To achieve Shannon security, a source of perfectly unpredictable random data is needed. One theoretical basis for the physical existence of unpredictability is <a href="/wiki/Quantum_mechanics.html" title="Quantum mechanics">quantum mechanics</a>. Its assertions of unpredictability are subject to experimental test. <i>See:</i> <a href="/wiki/Bell_test_experiments.html" title="Bell test experiments">Bell test experiments</a>. Another basis is the theory of unstable <a href="/wiki/Dynamical_system.html" title="Dynamical system">dynamical systems</a> and <a href="/wiki/Chaos_theory.html" title="Chaos theory">Chaos theory</a>. These theories suggest that even in the deterministic world of <a href="/wiki/Newtonian_mechanics.html" title="Newtonian mechanics">Newtonian mechanics</a>, real-world systems evolve in ways that cannot be predicted in practice because one would need to know the initial conditions to an accuracy that <a href="/wiki/Exponential_growth.html" title="Exponential growth">grows exponentially</a> over time.</p>
<p>For use in a one-time pad, data should exhibit perfect randomness. Most practical sources exhibit some imperfection or bias. The quality of randomness is measured by <a href="/wiki/Information_entropy.html" title="Information entropy">entropy</a>. A perfectly random bit has an entropy of one. An idea due to Von Neumann is to use an algorithm to combine multiple, imperfectly random bits, each with entropy less than one, to create a single bit with entropy equal to one. This process is called <b>entropy distillation</b> or <b>entropy extraction</b>. Von Neumann proposed the following method, called "Von Neumann whitening":<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a  title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
<table class="wikitable">

</table>
<p>This will produce uniformly random output bits if the input bits are <a href="/wiki/Statistically_independent.html" title="Statistically independent">statistically independent</a> and all drawn from the <i>same</i> distribution. However, that is not a realistic assumption since most physical randomness sources may have some correlation in the output, and the distribution may change with the device temperature, etc. In 2003, <a  class="new" title="Boaz Barak">Boaz Barak</a>, <a  class="new" title="Ronen Shaltiel">Ronen Shaltiel</a>, and <a  class="new" title="Eran Tromer">Eran Tromer</a> stated some reasonable security criteria for entropy distillation and constructed an algorithm for doing it.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a  title="">[10]</a></sup> (description needed).</p>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/Linux.html" title="Linux">Linux</a> (and some other <a href="/wiki/Unix-like.html" title="Unix-like">Unix-like</a> systems) the kernel's random number generator, <a href="/wiki//dev/random.html" title="/dev/random">/dev/random</a>, uses environmental noise to generate random data and is better than many such <a href="/wiki/System_call.html" title="System call">system call</a> designs. It attempts to estimate the amount of entropy it collects and blocks if the entropy pool is exhausted. It is intended to be, and is widely thought to actually be, better than most such generators, and if so is rather closer to satisfactorily random. But this process will be slow on systems which have few usable noise sources. It can, however, be fed additional entropy by reading from an attached noise generating device.</p>
<p>Linux also provides /dev/urandom which uses a deterministic algorithm to generate the data whenever environmental noise is unavailable. Improved designs, such as the <a href="/wiki/Yarrow_algorithm.html" title="Yarrow algorithm">Yarrow algorithm</a> are available. One-time pad key material generated in this way (ie, from deterministic random number generators) lacks the information-theoretic security of a one-time pad. Yarrow offers at least as much strength as a block cipher based on <a href="/wiki/Triple_DES.html" title="Triple DES">Triple DES</a>.</p>
<p>If a computer used for one-time pad generation is compromised, by a <a href="/wiki/Computer_virus.html" title="Computer virus">computer virus</a> or other <a href="/wiki/Malware.html" title="Malware">malware</a> or by an adversary gaining physical access, the software can be modified to leak the pad data or generate apparently random data that is in fact predictable. See <a href="/wiki/Random_number_generator_attack.html" title="Random number generator attack">random number generator attack</a>. One way to reduce this risk is to generate pads on a machine that is never connected to any computer network and preferably not used for any other purpose. Collecting key material on new, blank media (e.g. <a href="/wiki/Floppy_disk.html" title="Floppy disk">floppy disks</a> or <a href="/wiki/CD-R.html" title="CD-R">CD-Rs</a>) eliminates another route for malware infection. If paper pads are to be produced, the printer is best dedicated as well.

<h2>Making one-time pads by hand</h2>
<p>One-time pads were originally made without the use of a computer and this is still possible today. The process can be tedious, but if done correctly and the pad used only once, the result is unbreakable.</p>
<p>There are two components needed to make a one-time pad: a way to generate letters at random and a way to record two copies of the result. The traditional way to do the latter was to use a <a href="/wiki/Typewriter.html" title="Typewriter">typewriter</a> and <a href="/wiki/Carbon_paper.html" title="Carbon paper">carbon paper</a>. Typewriters are scarce these days and add a requirement to destroy the carbon paper and typewriter ribbon, from which the pad data can often be recovered. A more modern approach is to hand write the letters neatly in groups of five on two part <a href="/wiki/Carbonless_copy_paper.html" title="Carbonless copy paper">carbonless copy paper</a> sheets, which can be purchased at office supply stores. Each sheet should be given a serial number or some other unique marking.</p>
<p>The simplest way to generate random letters is to obtain 26 identical objects with each letter of the alphabet marked on one object. Tiles from the game <a href="/wiki/Scrabble.html" title="Scrabble">Scrabble</a> can be used as long as only one of each letter is selected. Kits for making name charm bracelets are another possibility. One can also write the letters on 26 <a href="/wiki/Penny_%28U.S._coin%29.html" title="Penny (U.S. coin)">pennies</a> with a marking pen. The objects are placed in a box or cup and shaken vigorously, then one object is withdrawn and its letter is recorded. The object is returned to the box and the process is repeated.</p>
