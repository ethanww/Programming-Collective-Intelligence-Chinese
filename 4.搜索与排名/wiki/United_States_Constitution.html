<p>During the <a href="/wiki/American_Revolutionary_War.html" title="American Revolutionary War">Revolutionary War</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Thirteen_Colonies.html" title="Thirteen Colonies">thirteen states</a> first formed a weak <a href="/wiki/Central_government.html" title="Central government">central government</a>—with the <a href="/wiki/Continental_Congress.html" title="Continental Congress">Congress</a> being its only component—under the <a href="/wiki/Articles_of_Confederation.html" title="Articles of Confederation">Articles of Confederation</a>. Congress lacked any power to impose <a href="/wiki/Tax.html" title="Tax">taxes</a>, and, because there was no national <a href="/wiki/Executive_%28government%29.html" title="Executive (government)">executive</a> or <a href="/wiki/Judiciary.html" title="Judiciary">judiciary</a>, it relied on state authorities, who were often uncooperative, to enforce all its acts. It also had no authority to override <a href="/wiki/Taxation_in_the_United_States.html" title="Taxation in the United States">tax</a> laws and <a href="/wiki/Tariff.html" title="Tariff">tariffs</a> between states. The Articles required unanimous consent from all the states before they could be amended and states took the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent. For lack of a <a href="/wiki/Quorum.html" title="Quorum">quorum</a>, Congress was frequently blocked from making even moderate changes.</p>
<p>In September 1786, commissioners from five states met in the <a href="/wiki/Annapolis_Convention_%281786%29.html" title="Annapolis Convention (1786)">Annapolis Convention</a> to discuss adjustments to the Articles of Confederation that would improve commerce. They invited state representatives to convene in <a href="/wiki/Philadelphia%2C_Pennsylvania.html" title="Philadelphia, Pennsylvania">Philadelphia</a> to discuss improvements to the federal government. After debate, the Confederation Congress endorsed the plan to revise the Articles of Confederation on <a href="/wiki/February_21.html" title="February 21">February 21</a>, <a href="/wiki/1787.html" title="1787">1787</a>. Twelve states, <a href="/wiki/Rhode_Island.html" title="Rhode Island">Rhode Island</a> being the only exception, accepted this invitation and sent delegates to convene in May 1787. The resolution calling the Convention specified its purpose was to propose amendments to the Articles, but the Convention decided to propose a rewritten Constitution. The <a href="/wiki/Philadelphia_Convention.html" title="Philadelphia Convention">Philadelphia Convention</a> voted to keep deliberations secret and decided to draft a new fundamental government design which eventually stipulated that only 9 of the 13 states would have to ratify for the new government to go into effect (for the participating states). These actions were criticized by some as exceeding the convention's mandate and existing law. However, Congress, noting dissatisfaction with the Articles of Confederation government, unanimously agreed to submit the proposal to the states despite what some perceived as the exceeded terms of reference. On <a href="/wiki/September_17.html" title="September 17">September 17</a>, <a href="/wiki/1787.html" title="1787">1787</a>, the Constitution was completed in Philadelphia, followed by a speech given by <a href="/wiki/Benjamin_Franklin.html" title="Benjamin Franklin">Benjamin Franklin</a>. In it he talked about how he wasn't completely satisfied with it but that perfection would never fully be achieved. He accepted the document as it was and he wanted all those against the ratification of it to do the same. The new government it prescribed came into existence on <a href="/wiki/March_4.html" title="March 4">March 4</a>, <a href="/wiki/1789.html" title="1789">1789</a>, after fierce fights over <a href="/wiki/Ratification.html" title="Ratification">ratification</a> in many of the states.</p>
<p>All four pages of the original transcribed copy of the Constitution are retained by the <a href="/wiki/National_Archives_and_Records_Administration.html" title="National Archives and Records Administration">National Archives</a> in <a href="/wiki/Washington%2C_D.C..html" title="Washington, D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a> Only the first page and the fourth (signature) page are on permanent display, with the document being on public display in its entirety only on Constitution Day (September 17) each year.</p>

<dd><i>We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.</i></dd>

<p>The Preamble neither grants any powers nor inhibits any actions; it only explains the rationale behind the Constitution. The Preamble, especially the first three words ("We the people"), is one of the most quoted and referenced sections of the Constitution.</p>

<p><b>Article Four</b> describes the relationship between the states and the Federal government, and amongst the states. For instance, it requires states to give "<a href="/wiki/Full_Faith_and_Credit_Clause.html" title="Full Faith and Credit Clause">full faith and credit</a>" to the public acts, records and court proceedings of the other states. Congress is permitted to <a href="/wiki/Regulate.html" title="Regulate">regulate</a> the manner in which proof of such acts, records or proceedings may be admitted. The <a href="/wiki/Privileges_and_Immunities_Clause.html" title="Privileges and Immunities Clause">"privileges and immunities" clause</a> prohibits state governments from discriminating against citizens of other states in favor of resident citizens (e.g., having tougher penalties for residents of Ohio convicted of crimes within Michigan). It also establishes <a href="/wiki/Extradition.html" title="Extradition">extradition</a> between the states, as well as laying down a legal basis for freedom of movement and travel amongst the states. Today, this provision is sometimes taken for granted, especially by citizens who live near state borders; but in the days of the <a href="/wiki/Articles_of_Confederation.html" title="Articles of Confederation">Articles of Confederation</a>, crossing state lines was often a much more arduous (and costly) process. Article Four also provides for the creation and admission of new states. The <a href="/wiki/Territorial_Clause.html" title="Territorial Clause">Territorial Clause</a> gives Congress the power to make rules for disposing of Federal property and governing non-state territories of the United States.

<p><b>Article Five</b> describes the process necessary to amend the Constitution. It establishes two methods of proposing amendments: by Congress or by a <a href="/wiki/Convention_to_propose_amendment_to_U.S._Constitution.html" title="Convention to propose amendment to U.S. Constitution">national convention</a> requested by the states. Under the first method, Congress can propose an amendment by a two-thirds vote (of a quorum, not necessarily of the entire body) of the Senate and of the House of Representatives. Under the second method, two-thirds of the <a href="/wiki/State_legislature.html" title="State legislature">state legislatures</a> may convene and "apply" to Congress to hold a national convention, whereupon Congress must call such a convention for the purpose of considering amendments. As of mid-2006, only the first method (proposal by Congress) has been used.</p>
<p>Once proposed—whether submitted by a national convention or by Congress—amendments must then be ratified by three-fourths of the states to take effect. Article Five gives Congress the option of requiring ratification by state legislatures or by special <a href="/wiki/Conventions_within_the_states_to_ratify_an_amendment_to_U.S._Constitution.html" title="Conventions within the states to ratify an amendment to U.S. Constitution">conventions</a> assembled in the states. The convention method of ratification has been used only once (to approve the <a href="/wiki/Twenty-first_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution.html" title="Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution">21st Amendment</a>). Article Five currently places only one limitation on the amending power—that no amendment can deprive a state of its equal representation in the Senate without that state's consent.</p>

<p><a name="Provisions_for_amendment" id="Provisions_for_amendment"></a></p>
<h2>Provisions for amendment</h2>
<p>The authors of the Constitution were clearly aware that changes would be necessary from time to time if the Constitution was to endure and cope with the effects of the anticipated growth of the nation. However, they were also conscious that such change should not be easy, lest it permit ill-conceived and hastily passed <a href="/wiki/Constitutional_amendment.html" title="Constitutional amendment">amendments</a>. Balancing this, they also wanted to ensure that an overly rigid requirement of unanimity would not block action desired by the vast majority of the population. Their solution was to devise a dual process by which the Constitution could be altered.</p>
<p>The first option must begin in Congress which, by a two-thirds vote (of a quorum) in each house, may initiate an amendment. Alternatively, the legislatures of two-thirds of the several states may ask Congress to call a <a href="/wiki/Convention_to_propose_amendment_to_U.S._Constitution.html" title="Convention to propose amendment to U.S. Constitution">national convention</a> to discuss and draft amendments. To date, all amendments have been proposed by Congress; although state legislatures have on occasion requested the calling of a convention, no such request has yet received the concurrence required for such a convention.</p>
<p>In either case, amendments must have the approval of the legislatures or of smaller <a href="/wiki/Conventions_within_the_states_to_ratify_an_amendment_to_U.S._Constitution.html" title="Conventions within the states to ratify an amendment to U.S. Constitution">ratifying conventions</a> within three-fourths of the states before becoming part of the Constitution. All amendments save one have been submitted to the state legislatures for ratification; only the <a href="/wiki/Twenty-first_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution.html" title="Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution">21st Amendment</a> was ratified by individual conventions in the states.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Constitutional_amendment#Form_of_changes_to_the_text.html" title="Constitutional amendment">Unlike most constitutions</a>, amendments to the U.S. constitution are appended to the existing body of the text, rather than being revisions of or insertions into the main articles. There is no provision for expunging from the text obsolete or rescinded provisions.</p>
<p>Some people feel that <a href="/wiki/Demographics.html" title="Demographics">demographic</a> changes in the U.S.—specifically the great disparity in population between states—have made the Constitution too difficult to amend, with states representing as little as 4% of the population theoretically able to block an amendment desired by over 90% of Americans; others feel that it is unlikely that such an extreme result would occur. However, any proposals to change this would necessarily involve amending the Constitution itself, creating something of a <a href="/wiki/Catch_22_%28logic%29.html" title="Catch 22 (logic)">Catch-22</a>.</p>
<p>Aside from the direct process of amending the Constitution, the practical effect of its provisions may be altered by judicial decision. The United States is a <a href="/wiki/Common_law.html" title="Common law">common law</a> country, and courts follow the <a href="/wiki/Precedent.html" title="Precedent">precedents</a> established in prior cases. However, when a Supreme Court decision clarifies the application of a part of the Constitution to existing law, the effect is to establish the meaning of that part for all practical purposes. Not long after adoption of the Constitution, in the 1803 case of <i><a href="/wiki/Marbury_v._Madison.html" title="Marbury v. Madison">Marbury v. Madison</a>,</i> the Supreme Court established the doctrine of <a href="/wiki/Judicial_review.html" title="Judicial review">judicial review</a>, which is the power of the Court to examine legislation and other acts of Congress and to decide their <a href="/wiki/Constitutionality.html" title="Constitutionality">constitutionality</a>. The doctrine also embraces the power of the Court to explain the meaning of various sections of the Constitution as they apply to particular cases brought before the Court. Since such cases will reflect changing legal, political, economic, and social conditions, this provides a mechanism, in practice, for adjusting the Constitution without needing to amend its text. Over the years, a series of Court decisions, on issues ranging from governmental regulation of <a href="/wiki/Radio.html" title="Radio">radio</a> and <a href="/wiki/Television.html" title="Television">television</a> to the rights of the accused in criminal cases, has effected a change in the way many Constitutional clauses are interpreted, without amendment to the actual text of the Constitution.</p>
<p>Congressional legislation, passed to implement provisions of the Constitution or to adapt those implementations to changing conditions, also broadens and, in subtle ways, changes the meanings given to the words of the Constitution. Up to a point, the rules and regulations of the many agencies of the federal government have a similar effect. In case of objection, the test in both cases is whether, in the opinion of the courts, such legislation and rules conform with the meanings given to the words of the Constitution.</p>

<p>The Bill of Rights comprises the first ten amendments to the Constitution. Those amendments were adopted between 1789 and 1791, and all relate to limiting the power of the federal government. They were added in response to criticisms of the Constitution by the state ratification conventions and by prominent individuals such as <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson.html" title="Thomas Jefferson">Thomas Jefferson</a> (who was not a delegate to the Constitutional Convention). These critics argued that without further restraints, the strong central government would become tyrannical. The amendments were proposed by Congress as part of a block of twelve in September 1789. By December 1791 a sufficient number of states had ratified ten of the twelve proposals, and the Bill of Rights became part of the Constitution.</p>
<p>It is commonly understood that the Bill of Rights was not originally intended to apply to the states, though except where amendments refer specifically to the Federal Government or a branch thereof (as in the <a href="/wiki/First_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution.html" title="First Amendment to the United States Constitution">first amendment</a>, under which some states in the early years of the nation officially established a religion), there is no such delineation in the text itself. Nevertheless, a general interpretation of inapplicability to the states remained until 1868, when the <a href="/wiki/Fourteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution.html" title="Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution">Fourteenth Amendment</a> was passed, which stated, in part, that:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>The Supreme Court has interpreted this clause to extend most, but not all, parts of the Bill of Rights to the states. Nevertheless, the balance of state and federal power has remained a battle in the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>The amendments that became the Bill of Rights were actually the last ten of the twelve amendments proposed in 1789. The second of the twelve proposed amendments, regarding the compensation of members of Congress, remained unratified until 1992, when the legislatures of enough states finally approved it and, as a result, it became the <a href="/wiki/Twenty-seventh_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution.html" title="Twenty-seventh Amendment to the United States Constitution">Twenty-seventh Amendment</a> despite more than two centuries of pendency. The <a href="/wiki/Congressional_Apportionment_Amendment.html" title="Congressional Apportionment Amendment">first of the twelve</a>—still technically pending before the state legislatures for ratification—pertains to the apportionment of the <a href="/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives.html" title="United States House of Representatives">United States House of Representatives</a> after each decennial <a href="/wiki/Census.html" title="Census">census</a>. The most recent state whose lawmakers are known to have ratified this proposal is <a href="/wiki/Kentucky.html" title="Kentucky">Kentucky</a> in 1792 during that commonwealth's first month of statehood.</p>

<p>The last two of the first ten amendments contain very broad statements of constitutional authority.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Ninth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution.html" title="Ninth Amendment to the United States Constitution">Ninth Amendment</a> declares that the listing of individual rights in the Constitution and Bill of Rights is not meant to be comprehensive; and that the people have other rights not specifically mentioned in the Constitution, but rather retained elsewhere by the people of the individual states. The right of privacy has been interpreted as one of these unenumerated rights by many people. The right of the people to keep and bear arms (the protection of which right the Second Amendment prohibits infringement) is also often interpreted as another of these unenumerated rights by many people. <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.guncite.com/journals/nj9th.html#pg64">[4]</a> Other, pre-existing, non-enumerated rights, besides just these two, continue to exist because of the Ninth Amendment.

<h3>Subsequent amendments (11–27)</h3>
<p>Amendments to the Constitution subsequent to the Bill of Rights cover many subjects. The majority of the seventeen later amendments stem from continued efforts to expand individual civil or political liberties, while a few are concerned with modifying the basic governmental structure drafted in Philadelphia in 1787. Although the United States Constitution has been amended a total of 17 times, only 16 of the amendments are currently used because the 21st amendment supersedes the 18th.</p>

<h3>Unratified amendments</h3>
<p>Over 10,000 Constitutional amendments have been introduced in Congress since 1789; in a typical Congressional year in the last several decades, between 100 and 200 are offered. Most of these concepts never get out of Congressional committee, much less get proposed by the Congress for ratification. Backers of some amendments have attempted the alternative, and thus far never-utilized, method mentioned in Article Five. In two instances—reapportionment in the 1960s and a balanced federal budget during the 1970s and 1980s—these attempts have come within just two state legislative "applications" of triggering that alternative method.</p>
<p>The Eighteenth Amendment is the only amendment to be directly and specifically repealed by another (the Twenty-first). The episode highlighted the importance of proposing and ratifying only the most important, and least evanescent, of amendments.</p>
<p>Of the thirty-three amendments that have been proposed by Congress, six have failed ratification by the required three-quarters of the state legislatures—and four of those six are still technically pending before state lawmakers. Starting with the 18th amendment, each proposed amendment (except for the 19th Amendment and for the still-pending Child Labor Amendment of 1924) has specified a deadline for passage. The following are the unratified amendments:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="/wiki/Congressional_Apportionment_Amendment.html" title="Congressional Apportionment Amendment">Congressional Apportionment Amendment</a> proposed by the <a href="/wiki/First_United_States_Congress.html" title="First United States Congress">1st Congress</a> on <a href="/wiki/September_25.html" title="September 25">September 25</a>, <a href="/wiki/1789.html" title="1789">1789</a>, defined a formula for how many members there would be in the <a href="/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives.html" title="United States House of Representatives">United States House of Representatives</a> after each decennial <a href="/wiki/Census.html" title="Census">census</a>. Ratified by eleven states, the last being <a href="/wiki/Kentucky.html" title="Kentucky">Kentucky</a> in June 1792 (Kentucky's initial month of statehood), this amendment contains no expiration date for ratification. In principle it may yet be ratified, though as written it became moot when the population of the United States reached ten million.</li>
<li>The so-called <a href="/wiki/The_missing_thirteenth_amendment.html" title="The missing thirteenth amendment">missing thirteenth amendment</a>, or "Titles of Nobility Amendment" (TONA), proposed by the <a href="/wiki/11th_Congress.html" title="11th Congress">11th Congress</a> on <a href="/wiki/May_1.html" title="May 1">May 1</a>, <a href="/wiki/1810.html" title="1810">1810</a>, would have ended the citizenship of any American accepting "any Title of Nobility or Honour" from any foreign power. Some maintain that the amendment <i>was</i> actually ratified by the legislatures of enough states, and that a conspiracy has suppressed it, but this has been thoroughly debunked <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.thirdamendment.com/missing.html">[5]</a>. Known to have been ratified by lawmakers in twelve states, the last in 1812, this amendment contains no expiration date for ratification. It may yet be ratified.</li>
<li>The <a href="/wiki/Corwin_amendment.html" title="Corwin amendment">Corwin amendment</a>, proposed by the <a href="/wiki/Thirty-sixth_United_States_Congress.html" title="Thirty-sixth United States Congress">36th Congress</a> on <a href="/wiki/March_2.html" title="March 2">March 2</a>, <a href="/wiki/1861.html" title="1861">1861</a>, would have forbidden any attempt to subsequently amend the Constitution to empower the Federal government to "abolish or interfere" with the "domestic institutions" of the states (a delicate way of referring to <a href="/wiki/Slavery.html" title="Slavery">slavery</a>). It was ratified by only <a href="/wiki/Ohio.html" title="Ohio">Ohio</a> and <a href="/wiki/Maryland.html" title="Maryland">Maryland</a> lawmakers before the outbreak of the <a href="/wiki/American_Civil_War.html" title="American Civil War">Civil War</a>. <a href="/wiki/Illinois.html" title="Illinois">Illinois</a> lawmakers—sitting as a state constitutional convention at the time—likewise approved it, but that action is of questionable validity. The proposed amendment contains no expiration date for ratification and may yet be ratified. However, adoption of the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments after the Civil War likely means that the amendment would be ineffective if adopted.</li>
<li>A <a href="/wiki/Child_labor_amendment.html" title="Child labor amendment">child labor amendment</a> proposed by the <a href="/wiki/Sixty-eighth_United_States_Congress.html" title="Sixty-eighth United States Congress">68th Congress</a> on <a href="/wiki/June_2.html" title="June 2">June 2</a>, <a href="/wiki/1924.html" title="1924">1924</a>, which stipulates: "The Congress shall have power to limit, regulate, and prohibit the labor of persons under eighteen years of age." This amendment is now moot, since subsequent federal <a href="/wiki/Child_labor_laws.html" title="Child labor laws">child labor laws</a> have uniformly been upheld as a valid exercise of Congress' powers under the <a href="/wiki/Commerce_clause.html" title="Commerce clause">commerce clause</a>. This amendment contains no expiration date for ratification. It may yet be ratified.</li>

<h3>Expired amendments</h3>
<p>Properly placed in a separate category from the other four constitutional amendments that Congress proposed to the states, but which not enough states have approved, are the following two offerings which—due to deadlines—are no longer subject to ratification.</p>

Of the 35 states ratifying it, four later rescinded their ratifications prior to the extended ratification period which commenced <a href="/wiki/March_23.html" title="March 23">March 23</a>, <a href="/wiki/1979.html" title="1979">1979</a> and a fifth—while not going so far as to actually rescind its earlier ratification—adopted a resolution stipulating that its approval would not extend beyond <a href="/wiki/March_22.html" title="March 22">March 22</a>, <a href="/wiki/1979.html" title="1979">1979</a>.

<p>To a small degree, historians disagree on the specific international influences on the development of the Constitution, possibly due to the variety of sources. Many argue that several of the ideas embodied in the Constitution were new, and that a large number of ideas were drawn from <a href="/wiki/Classical_Antiquity.html" title="Classical Antiquity">Classical Antiquity</a> and the British governmental tradition of <a href="/wiki/Mixed_government.html" title="Mixed government">mixed government</a>, which was in practice among 12 of the 13 states. Many historians do not specifically consider other sources, but the ideas advocated by the writings of <a href="/wiki/Charles_de_Secondat%2C_Baron_de_Montesquieu.html" title="Charles de Secondat, Baron de Montesquieu">Charles de Secondat, Baron de Montesquieu</a> are prominent among the contenders of non-British European influences. A number of historians also note the direct influence of the <a href="/wiki/Dutch_Republic.html" title="Dutch Republic">Republic of the United Provinces</a>, which had itself a Constitution in place for two centuries by 1781 with many similarities to the American Constitution — some of their ideas though were also drawn from <a href="/wiki/Classical_Antiquity.html" title="Classical Antiquity">Classical Antiquity</a>.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, the influence of the United Kingdom is considered more prominent than other contemporary European influences. The United States Constitution was partly based on ideas from Article 39 from the <a href="/wiki/Magna_Carta.html" title="Magna Carta">Magna Carta</a> of 1215 which states that:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>No free man shall be arrested, or imprisoned, or deprived of his property, or outlawed, or exiled, or in any way destroyed, nor shall we go against him or send against him, unless by legal judgement of his peers, or by the law of the land.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>The English <a href="/wiki/Bill_of_Rights_1689.html" title="Bill of Rights 1689">Bill of Rights (1689)</a> also acted as a source of ideas for the United States Constitution. For example, like the English Bill of Rights, the U.S. Constitution requires jury trials, contains a right to bear arms, and prohibits excessive bail and of “cruel and unusual punishments.”</p>
<p>Liberties guaranteed by Magna Carta and the 1689 English Bill of Rights were directly incorporated into state statutes and the <a href="/wiki/Virginia_Declaration_of_Rights.html" title="Virginia Declaration of Rights">Virginia Declaration of Rights</a>, and many were then further incorporated into the Constitution and the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Bill_of_Rights.html" title="United States Bill of Rights">United States Bill of Rights</a>.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, arguments for a significant Dutch influence of the Constitution were pronounced by the founding fathers: Benjamin Franklin said that “in love of liberty and in the defense of it, [the Republic of the United Provinces] has been our example” <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.netherlands-embassy.org/article.asp?articleref=AR00000379EN">[6]</a>, while John Adams remarked that “the originals of the two Republics are so much alike that the history of one seems but a transcript from that of the other” <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nationarchive.com/Summaries/v101i2626_17.htm">[7]</a>. James Madison, writing in 1822, said “The example of Holland proved that a toleration of sects dissenting from the established sect was safe and even useful … that religion flourishes in greater purity without than with the aid of government” <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/print_documents/amendI_religions66.html">[8]</a>. Several of the founding fathers were keen students of history.</p>

<p><a name="Legality_of_the_Constitution" id="Legality_of_the_Constitution"></a></p>
<h3>Legality of the Constitution</h3>
<p>One historical controversy is whether the Constitution was illegally adopted.</p>
<p>The Constitution was originally proposed by a convention which was convened for the express purpose of amending the <a href="/wiki/Articles_of_Confederation.html" title="Articles of Confederation">Articles of Confederation</a>. The Articles required ratification by the legislatures of all of the member states for amendments to take effect. Article Seven of the Constitution, however, only required ratification by conventions in nine states for that document to take effect. Scholars have traditionally resolved this contradiction by arguing that when the ninth state ratified the Constitution and the document took effect, those nine states implicitly seceded from the union governed by the Articles and created a new, separate federal union. Under this theory, those states that did not ratify the Constitution would have remained free and independent states, or parts of the old Confederation if they so chose.</p>
<p>Historian <a href="/wiki/Joseph_Ellis.html" title="Joseph Ellis">Joseph Ellis</a> in <i>Founding Brothers</i> charges that there is truth in the allegations that the:</p>
<ol>
<li>"Convention was extralegal, since its explicit mandate was to revise the Articles of Confederation, not replace them."</li>
<li>"Machinery for ratification did not require the unanimous consent [as] dictated by the Articles [of Confederation] themselves."</li>
</ol>
<p>Constitutional lawyer <a href="/wiki/Michael_P._Farris.html" title="Michael P. Farris">Michael P. Farris</a> disagrees, arguing that:</p>
<ol>
<li>"No limits were placed on the authority of the convention to make amendments," and that the Constitution is, in effect, simply an amended version of the Articles of Confederation.</li>
<li>"Congress and all thirteen state legislatures approved the new ratification process as required by the Articles." Eleven states held ratification conventions (approved by their legislatures) and approved the Constitution by <a href="/wiki/July_26.html" title="July 26">July 26</a>, <a href="/wiki/1788.html" title="1788">1788</a>, a direct approval of the change in procedure. The other two states' legislatures (of North Carolina and Rhode Island) also approved of the ratification process—North Carolina by holding a convention and Rhode Island by submitting the Constitution to a referendum, although they both rejected the Constitution (at first). Thus, the change in <i>procedure</i> was approved by all the states.</li>
</ol>
<p>Constitutional lawyer <a href="/wiki/Akhil_Amar.html" title="Akhil Amar">Akhil Reed Amar</a> disagrees with both. He argues that the United States under the Articles was a multilateral alliance among independent and sovereign nations and that the Constitution created a wholly new nation, which had the same name as the alliance. The states had the right under international law to withdraw from the Articles as each of the states had violated their obligations under the Articles of Confederation. Amar's interpretation has the appeal that it allows the Constitution ratification be legal, yet also makes the secession of the states prior to the <a href="/wiki/American_Civil_War.html" title="American Civil War">American Civil War</a> illegal, as, according to Amar, South Carolina and her sister states had ceased to be sovereign nations by ratifying the Constitution.</p>
<p>In contrast, American History professor Kevin R. C. Gutzman (Department of History and Non-Western Cultures, Western Connecticut State University) writes of this view that "this is simply erroneous: under the American theory of government, the People [of the individual states] are sovereign. As the Virginia General Assembly noted in the Report of 1800, the sovereign people of each state ratified the federal Constitution, so it is the people of each state that retains sovereignty".</p>
<p>In any case, all the states did ratify the Constitution, and a government has been operating under its provisions for over two centuries-- however their <a href="/wiki/Original_intent.html" title="Original intent">original intent</a> is in dispute, and they have thus "operated" under the threat of force since at least 1861. Likewise this use-- and threat-- of force, has never been officially <i>verfied</i> to the American People by the government of the United States. Rather, many claim that the American public has simply been forcibly indoctrinated with misinformation by the pro-government establishment, to the point where such <i>demands</i> for account cease to arise out of indoctrinated ignorance and complacency.</p>

<p><a name="Undemocratic_Nature_of_the_Constitution" id="Undemocratic_Nature_of_the_Constitution"></a></p>
<h3>Undemocratic Nature of the Constitution</h3>
<p>Charles Beard, in <a  class="external text" title="http://ideas.repec.org/b/hay/hetboo/beard1913.html"><i>An Economic Interpretation of the Constitution of the United States</i></a>, 1913, stated that:</p>
<ul>
<li>the states were undemocratic: they did not allow women, Native Americans, slaves, indentured servants, nor people not meeting property qualification, to vote. He questions whether and to what extent the states were democratic.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>the Constitution was designed by the wealthy (predominantly) as an instrument to serve and safeguard the interests of the wealthy. He cites <i>The <a href="/wiki/Federalist_Papers.html" title="Federalist Papers">Federalist Papers</a>, especially <a  class="external text" title="http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/v1ch4s19.html">No. 10</a></i> as expressing the design of the framers to safeguard the interests of the wealthy.</li>
</ul>
<p>"However, among his academic contemporaries, Beard's "Marxist" or "socialist" analysis (as it was referred to by some critics) received considerable support, and, according to McGuire, "Beard's thesis eventually emerged as the standard historical interpretation and remained so until the late 1950s" (p.17). By the late-1950s, however, Beard's thesis had come under renewed attack, and by "the beginning of the cold war era . . . the scholarly onslaught on Beard's interpretation had begun" (p.17). ] <i>"Nicholas Murray Butler (1939), the president of Columbia University, where Beard held a professorship in 1913 declared: 'It is a travesty to dignify so unscholarly an adventure by the title of an economic interpretation of history'."</i><a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bsos.umd.edu/gvpt/lpbr/subpages/reviews/McGuire304.htm">[9]</a></p>
<p>Robert A. McGuire, in <i>To Form a More Perfect Union: A New Economic Interpretation of the United States Constitution</i> (2003), "resurrects-to some extent-the Beard thesis. Though the details of McGuire's "new" economic interpretation of the Constitution vary a good deal from the details of Beard's original economic interpretation, the thrust of both is the same: the personal economic interests of the founders (and those of their constituents) played a determinative role in the development of the Constitution." <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bsos.umd.edu/gvpt/lpbr/subpages/reviews/McGuire304.html">[10]</a></p>
