<p>The <b>United States Navy</b> (also known as <b>USN</b> or the <b>U.S. Navy</b>) is the branch of the <a href="/wiki/United_States_armed_forces.html" title="United States armed forces">United States armed forces</a> responsible for conducting <a href="/wiki/Navy.html" title="Navy">naval</a> operations. Its stated mission is "to maintain, train and equip combat-ready Naval forces capable of winning wars, deterring aggression and maintaining freedom of the seas."<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a  title="">[1]</a></sup> The U.S. Navy currently numbers nearly 500,000 men and women on active duty or in the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Navy_Reserve.html" title="United States Navy Reserve">Navy Reserve</a> and operates 281 <a href="/wiki/Ship.html" title="Ship">ships</a> and more than 4,000 <a href="/wiki/Aircraft.html" title="Aircraft">aircraft</a>.<sup id="_ref-status_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>The United States Navy traces its origins to the <a href="/wiki/Continental_Navy.html" title="Continental Navy">Continental Navy</a>, which was established during the <a href="/wiki/American_Revolutionary_War.html" title="American Revolutionary War">American Revolutionary War</a> and was disbanded in 1790. The <a href="/wiki/United_States_Constitution.html" title="United States Constitution">United States Constitution</a>, though, formed the basis for a seaborne military force by giving <a href="/wiki/United_States_Congress.html" title="United States Congress">Congress</a> the power "to provide and maintain a navy."<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a  title="">[3]</a></sup> Depredations against American shipping by <a href="/wiki/Barbary_Coast.html" title="Barbary Coast">Barbary Coast</a> <a href="/wiki/Corsairs.html" title="Corsairs">corsairs</a> spurred Congress to enact this power in 1794<sup id="_ref-multiple1_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[4]</a></sup> by passing a naval act ordering the construction and manning of <a href="/wiki/Six_original_United_States_frigates.html" title="Six original United States frigates">six frigates</a>. The U.S. Navy came into international prominence in the 20th century, especially during <a href="/wiki/World_War_II.html" title="World War II">World War II</a>. Operating in both the European and <a href="/wiki/Pacific.html" title="Pacific">Pacific</a> theatres, it was a part of the conflict from the onset of American military involvement — the <a href="/wiki/Attack_on_Pearl_Harbor.html" title="Attack on Pearl Harbor">Attack on Pearl Harbor</a> — to Japan's official surrender on the deck of the <a href="/wiki/USS_Missouri_%28BB-63%29.html" title="USS Missouri (BB-63)">USS <i>Missouri</i></a>.

<p>The 21st century United States Navy maintains a sizeable presence in the world, deploying in such areas as East Asia, Southern Europe, and the Middle East. Its ability to <a href="/wiki/Power_projection.html" title="Power projection">project force</a> onto the littoral regions of the world, engage in forward areas during peacetime, and rapidly respond to regional crises makes it an active player in American foreign and defence policy.<sup id="_ref-forward_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[5]</a></sup> Despite decreases in ships and personnel following the Cold War, the U.S. Navy has continued to spend more on technology development than any other and is the world’s largest navy with a tonnage greater than that of the next 17 largest combined.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a  title="">[6]</a></sup></p>

Flag of the U.S. Navy</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>In the early stages of the <a href="/wiki/American_Revolutionary_War.html" title="American Revolutionary War">American Revolutionary War</a>, the establishment of an official navy was an issue of debate among the members of the <a href="/wiki/Continental_Congress.html" title="Continental Congress">Continental Congress</a>. Supporters argued that a navy would protect shipping, defend the coast, and make it easier to seek out support from foreign countries. Detractors countered that challenging the <a href="/wiki/British.html" title="British">British</a> <a href="/wiki/Royal_Navy.html" title="Royal Navy">Royal Navy</a>, then the world's preeminent naval power, was a foolish undertaking.<sup id="_ref-multiple1_1" class="reference"><a  title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>While Congress deliberated, it received word that two unarmed British supply ships from England were heading towards <a href="/wiki/Quebec.html" title="Quebec">Quebec</a> without escort. Plans were made to intercept the ships, but the armed vessels to be used were owned by individual colonies. Of greater significance, then, was an additional plan to equip two ships under the direct authority of Congress to capture British supply transports. The plan was not carried out until <a href="/wiki/October_13.html" title="October 13">October 13</a>, <a href="/wiki/1775.html" title="1775">1775</a>, when <a href="/wiki/George_Washington.html" title="George Washington">George Washington</a> announced that he had taken command of three armed schooners under Continental authority to intercept any British supply ships near Massachusetts. With the revelation that vessels were already sailing under Continental control, the decision to add two more was made easier.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a  title="">[7]</a></sup> The resolution was adopted and October 13 would later become known as the United States Navy's official birthday.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a  title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Continental Navy achieved mixed results; it was successful in a few individual engagements and raided many British merchant ships, but it lost 24 ships in the war<sup id="_ref-love_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[9]</a></sup>and at one point was reduced to two active vessels.<sup id="_ref-howarth_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[10]</a></sup> After the conflict, Congress turned its attention towards securing the western border of the new United States; a standing navy was considered to be a dispensable because of its high operating costs and its limited number of national roles.<sup id="_ref-multiple1_2" class="reference"><a  title="">[4]</a></sup> Within a span of two years, Congress sold the surviving ships and released the seamen and officers.</p>
<p>The United States would be without a navy for nearly a decade, a state of affairs that exposed its merchant ships to a series of attacks by <a href="/wiki/Barbary_pirates.html" title="Barbary pirates">Barbary pirates</a>. In response to these depredations, Congress ordered the construction and manning of six frigates on <a href="/wiki/March_27.html" title="March 27">March 27</a>, <a href="/wiki/1794.html" title="1794">1794</a>; <sup id="_ref-love_1" class="reference"><a  title="">[9]</a></sup> three years later the first three were welcomed into service: the <a href="/wiki/USS_United_States_%281797%29.html" title="USS United States (1797)">USS <i>United States</i></a>, <a href="/wiki/USS_Constellation_%281797%29.html" title="USS Constellation (1797)">USS <i>Constellation</i></a> and <a href="/wiki/USS_Constitution.html" title="USS Constitution">USS <i>Constitution</i></a>.</p>

<p>After an undeclared <a href="/wiki/Quasi-War.html" title="Quasi-War">Quasi-War</a> with France, the U.S. Navy saw substantial action in the <a href="/wiki/War_of_1812.html" title="War of 1812">War of 1812</a>, where it defeated rival British frigates on more than one occasion and emerged victorious in freshwater battles at <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Lake_Champlain.html" title="Battle of Lake Champlain">Lake Champlain</a> and <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Lake_Erie.html" title="Battle of Lake Erie">Lake Erie</a>. However, the U.S. Navy was not strong enough to prevent the British from blockading American ports and landing troops at will.<sup id="_ref-multiple1_3" class="reference"><a  title="">[4]</a></sup> Following the war, the U.S. Navy again focused its attention on protecting American shipping assets, sending squadrons to the Caribbean, the Mediterranean, South America, Africa, and the Pacific.<sup id="_ref-love_2" class="reference"><a  title="">[9]</a></sup> The United States went to war in 1846 <a href="/wiki/Mexican-American_War.html" title="Mexican-American War">against Mexico</a> and the Navy contributed by instituting a blockade, assisting the American takeover of <a href="/wiki/California.html" title="California">California</a>, and participating in the U.S. military's first large-scale amphibious operation at <a href="/wiki/Vera_Cruz.html" title="Vera Cruz">Vera Cruz</a>.<sup id="_ref-multiple1_4" class="reference"><a  title="">[4]</a></sup> The United States Navy established itself as a player in American foreign policy through the actions of <a href="/wiki/Commodore_%28USN%29.html" title="Commodore (USN)">Commodore</a> <a href="/wiki/Matthew_Perry_%28naval_officer%29.html" title="Matthew Perry (naval officer)">Matthew Perry</a> in Japan, which resulted in the <a href="/wiki/Convention_of_Kanagawa.html" title="Convention of Kanagawa">Convention of Kanagawa</a> in 1854.</p>
<p>Naval power would play a significant role during the <a href="/wiki/American_Civil_War.html" title="American Civil War">Civil War</a>, where the <a href="/wiki/Union_%28American_Civil_War%29.html" title="Union (American Civil War)">Union</a> had a distinct advantage over the <a href="/wiki/Confederate_States_of_America.html" title="Confederate States of America">Confederacy</a> on the seas.<sup id="_ref-multiple1_5" class="reference"><a  title="">[4]</a></sup> A <a href="/wiki/Union_blockade.html" title="Union blockade">Union blockade</a> on shipping handicapped the Southern effort throughout the conflict. The two American navies would help usher in a new era in world naval history by putting <a href="/wiki/Ironclad_warship.html" title="Ironclad warship">ironclad warships</a> into combat for the first time. The <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Hampton_Roads.html" title="Battle of Hampton Roads">Battle of Hampton Roads</a> in 1862, which pitted <a href="/wiki/USS_Monitor.html" title="USS Monitor">USS <i>Monitor</i></a> against <a href="/wiki/CSS_Virginia.html" title="CSS Virginia">CSS <i>Virginia</i></a>, became the first engagement between two steam-powered ironclads.<sup id="_ref-howarth_1" class="reference"><a  title="">[10]</a></sup> Soon after the war, however, the U.S. Navy slipped into obsolescence because of neglect.</p>
<p>A modernization program beginning in the 1880s brought the U.S. into the first rank of the world's navies by the end of the century. In 1907, several of the Navy's ships, dubbed the <a href="/wiki/Great_White_Fleet.html" title="Great White Fleet">Great White Fleet</a>, were showcased in a 14-month circumnavigation of the world. The trip was ordered by <a href="/wiki/President_of_the_United_States.html" title="President of the United States">President</a> <a href="/wiki/Theodore_Roosevelt.html" title="Theodore Roosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a> to test the Navy's capability to extend to the global theater.<sup id="_ref-love_3" class="reference"><a  title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Navy saw little action during <a href="/wiki/World_War_I.html" title="World War I">World War I</a>, but grew into a formidable force in the years before <a href="/wiki/World_War_II.html" title="World War II">World War II</a>. <a href="/wiki/Japan.html" title="Japan">Japan</a> unsuccessfully attempted to allay this strategic threat with a late-1941 surprise <a href="/wiki/Attack_on_Pearl_Harbor.html" title="Attack on Pearl Harbor">attack on Pearl Harbor</a>. Following American entry into the war, the U.S. Navy grew tremendously as the United States was faced with a two-front war on the seas.

<h3>Operating forces</h3>
<p>There are nine components to the <a href="/wiki/List_of_units_of_the_United_States_Navy.html" title="List of units of the United States Navy">operating forces</a> of the U.S. Navy: <a href="/wiki/United_States_Atlantic_Fleet.html" title="United States Atlantic Fleet">Atlantic Fleet</a>, <a href="/wiki/United_States_Pacific_Fleet.html" title="United States Pacific Fleet">Pacific Fleet</a>, Naval Forces Central Command, Naval Forces Europe, Naval Network Warfare Command, <a href="/wiki/United_States_Navy_Reserve.html" title="United States Navy Reserve">Navy Reserve</a>, <a href="/wiki/Naval_Special_Warfare_Command.html" title="Naval Special Warfare Command">Naval Special Warfare Command</a>, Operational Test and Evaluation Forces, and <a href="/wiki/Military_Sealift_Command.html" title="Military Sealift Command">Military Sealift Command</a>.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a  title="">[13]</a></sup> Fleets in the United States Navy take on the role of force provider; they do not carry out military operations independently, rather they train and maintain naval units that will subsequently be provided to the naval forces component of each Unified Combatant Command. A unit's fleet designation is usually based on geography; if a ship travels into a particular fleet's area of responsibility; it is placed under that fleet's command. Naval units are also organized by their type, under appropriately named "type commands;" an example is <i>Commander Submarine Force, U.S. Pacific Fleet</i>, which groups all submarines in the Pacific Fleet under one command. The United States Navy has five active numbered fleets, each led by a Vice Admiral.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/wiki/United_States_2nd_Fleet.html" title="United States 2nd Fleet">Second Fleet</a> operates in the Atlantic Ocean from the North to South Pole, from the Eastern United States to Western Europe and Africa, and along both the eastern and western shores of Central and South America. Second Fleet is the sole operational fleet in the <a href="/wiki/U.S._Atlantic_Fleet.html" title="U.S. Atlantic Fleet">Atlantic Fleet</a> and provides its forces to <a href="/wiki/United_States_Joint_Forces_Command.html" title="United States Joint Forces Command">Joint Forces Command</a> (USJFCOM). It also doubles as <a href="/wiki/NATO.html" title="NATO">NATO</a>'s <i>Commander Striking Fleet Atlantic</i>, making it the overseer of any multinational NATO naval force in the Atlantic. Second Fleet is based in <a href="/wiki/Norfolk%2C_Virginia.html" title="Norfolk, Virginia">Norfolk, Virginia</a> and its flagship is <a href="/wiki/USS_Wasp_%28LHD-1%29.html" title="USS Wasp (LHD-1)">USS <i>Wasp</i></a> (LHD-1).</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/United_States_3rd_Fleet.html" title="United States 3rd Fleet">Third Fleet</a>'s jurisdiction is the Northern, Southern, and Eastern Pacific Ocean along with the West Coast of the United States. Normally, units assigned to Third Fleet undergo training cruises prior to deployment with either the Fifth Fleet or Seventh Fleet and are not intended for immediate use in battle. Only in the event of general war does Third Fleet participate in active combat operations. Forming one half of the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Pacific_Fleet.html" title="United States Pacific Fleet">Pacific Fleet</a>, Third Fleet is a part of <a href="/wiki/United_States_Pacific_Command.html" title="United States Pacific Command">Pacific Command</a> (USPACOM) and is based in <a href="/wiki/San_Diego%2C_California.html" title="San Diego, California">San Diego, California</a> with <a href="/wiki/USS_Coronado_%28AGF-11%29.html" title="USS Coronado (AGF-11)">USS <i>Coronado</i></a> (AGF-11) as its flagship.</li>

<h3>Shore establishments</h3>
<p>Shore establishment commands exist to support the mission of the afloat fleets through the use of facilities on land. Focusing on logistics and combat-readiness, they are essential for the full, smooth, and continuous operation of operating forces. The variety of commands reflect the complexity of the modern U.S. Navy and range from naval intelligence to personnel training to maintaining repair facilities. Two of the major logistics and repair commands are <a href="/wiki/Naval_Sea_Systems_Command.html" title="Naval Sea Systems Command">Naval Sea Systems Command</a> and <a href="/wiki/Naval_Air_Systems_Command.html" title="Naval Air Systems Command">Naval Air Systems Command</a>. Other commands such as the <a href="/wiki/Office_of_Naval_Intelligence.html" title="Office of Naval Intelligence">Office of Naval Intelligence</a>, the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Naval_Observatory.html" title="United States Naval Observatory">United States Naval Observatory</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/Navy_War_College.html" title="Navy War College">Navy War College</a> are focused on intelligence and strategy. Training commands include the <a href="/wiki/Naval_Strike_and_Air_Warfare_Center.html" title="Naval Strike and Air Warfare Center">Naval Strike and Air Warfare Center</a> and the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Naval_Academy.html" title="United States Naval Academy">United States Naval Academy</a>.</p>
<p>The Navy maintains several "Naval Forces Commands" which operate naval <a href="/wiki/Shore_facility.html" title="Shore facility">shore facilities</a> and serve as liaison units to local ground forces of the Air Force and Army. Such commands are answerable to a Fleet Commander as the shore protector component of the afloat command. During times of war, all Naval Forces Commands augment to become task forces of a primary fleet. Some of the larger Naval Forces Commands in the <a href="/wiki/Pacific_Ocean.html" title="Pacific Ocean">Pacific Ocean</a> include <a href="/wiki/Commander_Naval_Forces_Korea.html" title="Commander Naval Forces Korea">Commander Naval Forces Korea</a> (CNFK), Commander Naval Forces Marianas (CNFM), and Commander Naval Forces Japan (CNFJ).</p>

<p>The United States Navy has nearly 500,000 personnel, approximately a quarter of whom are in ready reserve. Of those on active duty, more than eighty percent are enlisted sailors while commissioned officers make up around fifteen percent; the rest are <a href="/wiki/Midshipmen.html" title="Midshipmen">midshipmen</a> of the Naval Academy.<sup id="_ref-status_1" class="reference"><a  title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Sailors prove they have mastered skills and deserve responsibilities by completing Personnel Qualification Standards (PQS) tasks and examinations. Among the most important is the "warfare qualification," which denotes a journeyman level of capability in Aviation Warfare, Special Warfare, Surface Warfare, or Submarine Warfare. Many qualifications are denoted on a sailor's uniform with <a href="/wiki/Badges_of_the_United_States_Navy.html" title="Badges of the United States Navy">U.S. Navy badges and insignia</a>.</p>

</dl>
<p>Commissioned officers in the Navy have pay grades ranging from O-1 to O-10, with O-10 being the highest; those with paygrades between O-1 and O-4 are designated junior officers, those between O-5 and O-6 are dubbed senior officers, and officers in the O-7 to O-10 range are called flag officers. In the event that officers demonstrate superior performance, they are given an increase in paygrade; the official Navy term for this occasion is to be <i>promoted</i>. Above the rank of Admiral is the rank of <a href="/wiki/Fleet_Admiral_%28U.S.%29.html" title="Fleet Admiral (U.S.)">Fleet Admiral</a>, which was given to a select few in World War II, but has not been held by any officer since and is reserved for wartime use. Even higher than Fleet Admiral was the special rank of <a href="/wiki/Admiral_of_the_Navy.html" title="Admiral of the Navy">Admiral of the Navy</a>, which was awarded to only one person, <a href="/wiki/George_Dewey.html" title="George Dewey">George Dewey</a>, in 1899. Efforts to resurrect the rank in the 20th century failed, making it very unlikely that it will be used again. Commissioned officers originate from the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Naval_Academy.html" title="United States Naval Academy">United States Naval Academy</a>, <a href="/wiki/Navy_Reserve_Officer_Training_Corps.html" title="Navy Reserve Officer Training Corps">Navy Reserve Officer Training Corps</a> (NROTC), <a href="/wiki/Officer_Candidate_School.html" title="Officer Candidate School">Officer Candidate School</a> (OCS), and a host of other commissioning programs such as the Seaman to Admiral-21 program and the <a href="/wiki/Limited_Duty_Officer.html" title="Limited Duty Officer">Limited Duty Officer</a> Selection Program.</p>
<p>Commissioned officers can generally be divided into line officers and staff corps; line officers can be further split into unrestricted and restricted communities. <a href="/wiki/Unrestricted_Line_Officer.html" title="Unrestricted Line Officer">Unrestricted Line Officers</a> are the most visible and well-known, due to their role as the warfighting command element in the U.S. Navy. They receive training in tactics, strategy, command and control, and actual combat and are considered unrestricted because they are authorized to command ships, aviation squadrons, and special operations units. <a href="/wiki/Restricted_Line_Officer.html" title="Restricted Line Officer">Restricted Line Officers</a>, on the other hand, concentrate on non-combat related fields, which include engineering, maintenance, meteorology and oceanography, and intelligence; they are <i>not</i> qualified to command combat units. <a href="/wiki/List_of_United_States_Navy_staff_corps.html" title="List of United States Navy staff corps">Staff Corps</a> officers are specialists in fields that are themselves professional careers and not exclusive to the military, for example medicine, law, and civil engineering. They exist to augment the line communities and are able to be assigned to both line and staff commands.</p>
<p>The term "line" is a carryover from the 18th century British tactic of employing warships in a straight line to take advantage of cannons on each side of the ship. These vessels were dubbed "ships of the line" and those who commanded them were likewise called "line officers." Today, all United States Navy line officers denote their status with a star located above their rank devices on the shoulder boards and sleeves of their uniforms. Officers of the Staff Corps replace the star with different insignias to indicate their field of specialty.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a  title="">[15]</a></sup></p>

<h3>Chief Warrant Officer</h3>
<p>Chief Warrant Officer (CWO) pay grades range from CWO2 to the highest rank of CWO5. United States Navy CWOs are commissioned officers whose role is to provide leadership and skills for the most difficult and demanding operations in a particular technical specialty. They occupy a niche that is not as well served by the line officer community, which tends to have a broader focus. CWOs come from the senior non-commissioned officer ranks of the enlisted and receive their commission after completing the appropriately named Chief Warrant Officer Program. They typically become CWOs in specialties that are most related to their previous enlisted rating. Like Staff Corps officers, CWOs wear special insignia above the rank devices on their shoulder boards and sleeves to indicate their field of expertise.</p>

<p>Enlisted members of the Navy have pay grades from E-1 to E-9, with E-9 being the highest. All enlisted sailors with paygrades of E-4 and higher are considered <a href="/wiki/Non-commissioned_officers.html" title="Non-commissioned officers">non-commissioned officers</a> (NCOs) while those at E-7 and higher are further named chief petty officers. Unlike commissioned officers, who are given authority by the government, NCOs are promoted through the ranks of the enlisted. Those who demonstrate superior performance are given an increase in paygrade; the official Navy term is to be <i>advanced</i>. Two notable advancements are from <a href="/wiki/Seaman.html" title="Seaman">Seaman</a> to <a href="/wiki/Petty_Officer_Third_Class.html" title="Petty Officer Third Class">Petty Officer Third Class</a> (E-3 to E-4) and from <a href="/wiki/Petty_Officer_First_Class.html" title="Petty Officer First Class">Petty Officer First Class</a> to <a href="/wiki/Chief_Petty_Officer.html" title="Chief Petty Officer">Chief Petty Officer</a> (E-6 to E-7). Advancement to Chief Petty Officer is especially significant and is marked by a special initiation ceremony.</p>
<p>Enlisted members of pay grades E-4 and above are said to be "rated," meaning that they possess a <a href="/wiki/List_of_United_States_Navy_ratings.html" title="List of United States Navy ratings"><i>rating</i></a>, or occupational specialty. Members of grades E-1 to E-3 can also be rated, but do not necessarily have to be. There are more than 50 ratings covering a broad range of skills and subspecialties; examples include Engineman, Photographer's Mate, Gunner's Mate, Information Systems Technician, and Culinary Specialist. Ratings are earned through "A" schools, which are attended before deployment and after undergoing initial basic training at Recruit Training Command in Great Lakes, Illinois. Those who do not attend an "A" school go into the fleet to learn on the job and later <i>strike</i> for a rating. Some members may undergo additional training in a "C" school either before or after a tour of duty; upon completion, they are assigned a four-digit <a href="/wiki/Navy_Enlisted_Classification.html" title="Navy Enlisted Classification">Navy Enlisted Classification</a> (NEC) code, which identifies a skill that is outside of their standard rating. An example is NEC 2780, which shows that the sailor is qualified as a Network Security Vulnerablity Technician.</p>
<p>Rating badges and stripes are normally scarlet red or navy blue, depending on the color of the uniform. Those who demonstrate 12 or more years of good conduct, meaning they have not been subjected to <a href="/wiki/Non-judicial_punishment.html" title="Non-judicial punishment">non-judicial punishment</a> or <a href="/wiki/Court_martial.html" title="Court martial">court martial</a>, are awarded with gold insignia. Once qualified, they must maintain their good conduct status or risk having the right removed.</p>

Additionally, each ship is given a letter-based <a href="/wiki/Hull_classification_symbol.html" title="Hull classification symbol">hull classification symbol</a> (for example CVN and DDG) to indicate the vessel's type and a hull number.

<p><a href="/wiki/Aircraft_carrier.html" title="Aircraft carrier">Aircraft carriers</a> are regarded as the most important and most powerful warships in the United States Navy.<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a  title="">[21]</a></sup> Their ability to put most nations within striking distance of U.S. air power makes carriers the cornerstones of the United States’ forward deployment and deterrence strategy. Multiple carriers are deployed around the world at any given time to provide military presence, respond quickly to crises, and participate in joint exercises with allied forces. Former President <a href="/wiki/Bill_Clinton.html" title="Bill Clinton">Bill Clinton</a> summed up the importance of the aircraft carrier by stating that "when word of crisis breaks out in Washington, it's no accident the first question that comes to everyone's lips is; where is the nearest carrier?"<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a  title="">[22]</a></sup> The power and operational flexibility of a carrier naturally lie in the aircraft of its <a href="/wiki/Carrier_air_wing.html" title="Carrier air wing">carrier air wing</a>. Made up of both fixed-wing and rotary-wing aircraft, a carrier air wing is able to perform over 150 strike missions, hitting over 700 targets a day,<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a  title="">[23]</a></sup> protect friendly forces, conduct electronic warfare, assist in special operations, and carry out <a href="/wiki/Search_and_rescue.html" title="Search and rescue">search and rescue</a> missions. In addition to their airborne capabilities, carriers are also important as command platforms for large battle groups or multinational task forces.</p>
<p>A carrier is typically deployed along with a host of additional vessels, forming a <a href="/wiki/Carrier_battle_group.html" title="Carrier battle group"><i>carrier strike group</i></a>. The supporting ships, which usually include three or four <a href="/wiki/Aegis_combat_system.html" title="Aegis combat system">Aegis</a>-equipped cruisers and destroyers, a frigate, and two attack submarines, are tasked with protecting the carrier from air, missile, sea, and undersea threats as well as providing additional strike capabilities themselves. Ready logistics support for the group is provided by a combined ammunition, oiler, and supply ship.

<h3>Amphibious warfare vessels</h3>
<p><a href="/wiki/Amphibious_assault_ship.html" title="Amphibious assault ship">Amphibious assault ships</a> are the centerpieces of U.S. amphibious warfare and fulfill the same power projection role as aircraft carriers except that their striking force is comprised of land forces instead of aircraft.

Recently, amphibious assault ships have begun to be deployed as the core of an <i>expeditionary strike group</i>, which usually consists of an additional amphibious transport dock and dock landing ship for amphibious warfare and an Aegis-equipped cruiser and destroyer, frigate, and attack submarine for group defense. Amphibious assault ships are typically named after World War II aircraft carriers, a name source carried over from the earliest assault ships which actually <i>were</i> converted WWII carriers.</p>

<h3>Surface vessels</h3>
<p><a href="/wiki/Cruiser.html" title="Cruiser">Cruisers</a> are large surface combat vessels that conduct anti-air/anti-missile warfare, surface warfare, undersea warfare, and strike operations independently or as members of a larger task force. Modern guided missile cruisers were developed out of a need to counter the anti-ship missile threat facing the United States Navy. This led to the development of the <a href="/wiki/AN/SPY-1.html" title="AN/SPY-1">AN/SPY-1</a> phased array radar and the <a href="/wiki/Standard_missile.html" title="Standard missile">Standard Missile 2</a> with the <a href="/wiki/Aegis_combat_system.html" title="Aegis combat system">Aegis combat system</a> coordinating the two. <i>Ticonderoga</i>-class cruisers became the first to equip Aegis and were put to use primarily as anti-air and anti-missile defense in a battle force protection role. Later developments of <a href="/wiki/Vertical_launch_system.html" title="Vertical launch system">vertical launch systems</a> and the <a href="/wiki/BGM-109_Tomahawk.html" title="BGM-109 Tomahawk">Tomahawk missile</a> gave cruisers additional long-range land and sea strike capability, making them capable of both offensive and defensive battle operations. All cruisers since CG-47 have been named for famous battles with <a href="/wiki/USS_Thomas_S._Gates_%28CG-51%29.html" title="USS Thomas S. Gates (CG-51)">USS <i>Thomas S.

<p><a href="/wiki/Destroyers.html" title="Destroyers">Destroyers</a> are multi-mission medium surface ships capable of sustained performance in anti-air, anti-submarine, anti-ship, and offensive strike operations. Like cruisers, the guided missile destroyers of the Navy are primarily focused on surface strikes using <a href="/wiki/BGM-109_Tomahawk.html" title="BGM-109 Tomahawk">Tomahawk missiles</a> and fleet defense through <a href="/wiki/Aegis_combat_system.html" title="Aegis combat system">Aegis</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Standard_missile.html" title="Standard missile">Standard missile</a>.

<p>Modern U.S. <a href="/wiki/Frigate.html" title="Frigate">frigates</a> mainly perform undersea warfare for carrier strike groups and amphibious expeditionary groups and provide armed escort for supply convoys and merchant shipping. They are designed to protect friendly ships against hostile submarines in low to medium threat environments using torpedoes and LAMPS helicopters. Frigates are also able to launch Standard missiles to supply limited protection against anti-ship missiles. Independently, frigates are able to conduct counterdrug missions and other maritime interception operations. The U.S. Navy expects to retire its current class of frigates by 2020.<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a  title="">[24]</a></sup> As in the case of destroyers, frigates are named after naval heroes.</p>

<p>All U.S. <a href="/wiki/Battleship.html" title="Battleship">battleships</a> have been decommissioned and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register. Designed to engage other capital ships in open sea warfare, battleships were the Navy's largest and most important vessels until the mid-20th century. The rise of aircraft carriers in World War II led to the declining importance of battleships and the Navy relegated them to the roles of fire support and escort. Following a long period of inactivity, the <a href="/wiki/Iowa_class_battleship.html" title="Iowa class battleship"><i>Iowa</i> class</a> battleships were recommissioned in the 1980s to augment the Navy's size and were upgraded with Tomahawk cruise missile capability. They were decommissioned for the final time in the early 1990s due in part to their high maintenance costs and the Cold War's end. All battleships except <a href="/wiki/USS_Kearsarge_%28BB-5%29.html" title="USS Kearsarge (BB-5)">USS <i>Kearsarge</i></a> (BB-5) were named for states.</p>

<p>Aircraft are an essential component of the U.S. Navy's fighting capacity. Carrier-based aircraft are able to strike air, sea, and land targets far from a carrier strike group while protecting friendly forces from enemy aircraft, ships, and submarines. In peacetime, aircraft's ability to project the threat of sustained attack from a mobile platform on the seas gives United States leaders significant diplomatic and crisis-management options. Aircraft additionally provide <a href="/wiki/Logistics.html" title="Logistics">logistics</a> support to maintain the Navy’s readiness and, through helicopters, supply platforms with which to conduct <a href="/wiki/Search_and_rescue.html" title="Search and rescue">search and rescue</a>, <a href="/wiki/Special_operations.html" title="Special operations">special operations</a>, <a href="/wiki/Anti-submarine_warfare.html" title="Anti-submarine warfare">anti-submarine warfare</a> (ASW), and <a href="/wiki/Anti-surface_warfare.html" title="Anti-surface warfare">anti-surface warfare</a> (ASuW). The US Navy has global superiority in aircraft carriers: not only does the USN have as many aircraft carriers as the rest of the world put together, but its aircraft carriers individually are much larger than those of the rest of the world (with the notable exceptions of the <a href="/wiki/Soviet_aircraft_carrier_Kuznetsov.html" title="Soviet aircraft carrier Kuznetsov">Russian carrier <i>Kuznetsov</i></a> and the <a href="/wiki/FS_Charles_de_Gaulle.html" title="FS Charles de Gaulle">FS <i>Charles de Gaulle</i></a>), with commeasurately larger and more capable aircraft. Most foreign carriers except for these two vessels are smaller ships (displacement typically between 15,000 and 30,000 tons) carrying only <a href="/wiki/Helicopter.html" title="Helicopter">helicopters</a> and a small contingent of <a href="/wiki/AV-8B_Harrier_II.html" title="AV-8B Harrier II">AV-8B Harrier II</a> derivatives.

<p>Current U.S. Navy shipboard weapons systems are almost entirely focused on missiles, both as a weapon and as a threat. In an offensive role, missiles are intended to strike targets at long distances with accuracy and precision. Because they are unmanned weapons, missiles allow for attacks on heavily defended targets without risk to human pilots. Land and sea strikes are the domain of the <a href="/wiki/BGM-109_Tomahawk.html" title="BGM-109 Tomahawk">BGM-109 Tomahawk</a>, which was first deployed in the 1980s and is continually being updated to increase its capabilities.

Unguided munitions such as dumb bombs and <a href="/wiki/Cluster_bomb.html" title="Cluster bomb">cluster bombs</a> round out the rest of the weapons deployed by fixed-wing aircraft.</p>
<p>Rotary aircraft weapons revolve around anti-submarine warfare (ASW) and light to medium surface engagements. To combat submarines, helicopters use Mark 46 and Mark 50 torpedoes. Against small watercraft, they utilize <a href="/wiki/AGM-114_Hellfire.html" title="AGM-114 Hellfire">Hellfire</a> and <a href="/wiki/Penguin_missile.html" title="Penguin missile">Penguin</a> air to surface missiles. Helicopters also employ various types of mounted anti-personnel machine guns, including the <a href="/wiki/M60_machine_gun.html" title="M60 machine gun">M60D</a>, <a href="/wiki/M240.html" title="M240">M240</a>, <a href="/wiki/GAU-16.html" title="GAU-16">GAU-16</a>, and <a href="/wiki/GAU-17.html" title="GAU-17">GAU-17</a>.</p>

<p>The major players in U.S. Navy special operations are <a href="/wiki/United_States_Navy_SEALS.html" title="United States Navy SEALS">Navy SEALs</a> and <a href="/wiki/Special_Warfare_Combatant-craft_Crewman_Badge.html" title="Special Warfare Combatant-craft Crewman Badge">Special Warfare Combatant-craft Crewmen</a> (SWCCs, pronounced “swicks”). The SEALs derive their name from the environments in and from which they can operate: <i>SE</i>a, <i>A</i>ir, and <i>L</i>and. As befitting their title, the SEALs are a flexible group of naval <a href="/wiki/Special_Forces.html" title="Special Forces">Special Forces</a> trained to conduct clandestine warfare in any setting, most often in small-unit actions. They specialize in maritime operations; striking from and returning to the sea.<sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a  title="">[30]</a></sup> Working in conjunction with the SEALs are the SWCCs, who are trained in small ship and watercraft operations in the Navy.

Within Naval Special Warfare Command are six operational entities: four <i>Special Warfare Groups</i>, the <i>Special Warfare Development Group</i>, and the <i>Special Warfare Center</i>.</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Naval Special Warfare Group ONE</i> and <i>Group TWO</i> each consist of four teams of <a href="/wiki/United_States_Navy_SEALS.html" title="United States Navy SEALS">Navy SEALs</a> and a few Naval Special Warfare (NSW) Units. NSW units are charged with overall command and control and planning of special operations within their geographic jurisdiction.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>Group THREE</i> is made up of SEAL Delivery Vehicle (SDV) Teams and one Special Boat Team that is shared with Group FOUR. SEALs who are assigned to SDV teams specialize in the use of <a href="/wiki/Swimmer_Delivery_Vehicle.html" title="Swimmer Delivery Vehicle">Swimmer Delivery Vehicles</a> (known as "SEAL Delivery Vehicles" in American service) and <a href="/wiki/Advanced_SEAL_Delivery_System.html" title="Advanced SEAL Delivery System">Advanced SEAL Delivery Systems</a> (ASDSs).

<p>Coastal and harbor defense and protection of naval assets are placed under the jurisdiction of two Naval Coastal Warfare Groups: one for the Pacific Fleet and one for the Atlantic Fleet. Within these groups are <i>Mobile Security Squadrons</i> and <i>Naval Coastal Warfare Squadrons</i>. MSSs deploy Mobile Security Detachments that protect high value naval targets from terrorist attacks in ports and harbors where U.S. shore infrastructure is limited or does not exist. Naval Coastal Warfare Squadrons provide surveillance and security in harbors, coasts, and inshore areas. They are comprised of <i>Mobile Inshore Undersea Warfare Units</i> (MIUWUs) and <i>Inshore Boat Units</i> (IBUs). MIUWUs are charged with security, observation, and communications support for commanders operating in an inshore/coast environment, including anchorages and harbors. In the same operating environment, IBUs manage water craft for security, interdiction and surveillance.</p>

<h2>Military Sealift Command</h2>
<p><a href="/wiki/Military_Sealift_Command.html" title="Military Sealift Command">Military Sealift Command</a> (MSC) serves not only the United States Navy, but the entire Department of Defense as the ocean carrier of materiel during peacetime and war. It transports equipment, fuel, ammunition, and other goods essential to the smooth function of United States armed forces worldwide. Up to 95% of all supplies needed to sustain the U.S. military can be moved by Military Sealift Command.<sup id="_ref-31" class="reference"><a  title="">[38]</a></sup> MSC operates approximately 120 ships with 100 more in reserve and is unique in that its ships are manned not by active duty Navy personnel, but by civil service or contract merchant mariners.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>Four programs comprise Military Sealift Command: Sealift, Naval Fleet Auxiliary Force (NFAF), Special Mission, and Prepositioning. The Sealift program provides the bulk of the MSC’s supply-carrying operation and operates tankers for fuel transport and dry-cargo ships that transport equipment, vehicles, helicopters, ammunition, and supplies. The NFAF’s role is to directly replenish ships that are underway at sea, enabling them to deploy for long periods of time without having to come to port. NFAF also runs the Navy’s two <a href="/wiki/Hospital_ship.html" title="Hospital ship">hospital ships</a>, which provide emergency health care to both military personnel and civilians. The Special Mission program operates vessels for unique military and federal government tasks. They perform such duties as oceanographic and hydrographic surveys, submarine support, and missile flight data collection and tracking. The Prepositioning program sustains the U.S. military’s forward presence strategy by deploying supply ships in key areas of the ocean before it is actually needed. In the event of a contingency, these ships would be available to support military operations on short notice and before full-scale supply lines are established.</p>

<p>The uniforms of the United States Navy are designed to combine professionalism and naval heritage with versatility, safety, and comfort.<sup id="_ref-32" class="reference"><a  title="">[39]</a></sup> The Navy currently incorporates many different styles that are specific for a variety of uses and occasions. In most cases, distinctions are made to distinguish officers and enlisted men in their uniformed appearance. U.S. Navy uniforms can generally be divided into three categories: dress uniforms, service uniforms, and working uniforms.</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Dress uniforms</i> are worn during military-related formal occasions, such as ceremonies and other official functions. Many types of dress uniforms are used in the Navy with the full range of formal requirements represented. Service dress is the least formal dress uniform, full dress is one step higher in formality, and mess dress is the most formal dress available.</li>
<li><i>Service uniforms</i> are designed for daily wear and are most often worn in office or classroom-type settings, as well as other occasions in which physical activity is at a minimum.<sup id="_ref-33" class="reference"><a  title="">[40]</a></sup> The most visible distinction between officers and enlisted personnel are the color of the service uniform. Only officers and chief petty officers are authorized to wear service khaki; all other personnel must wear winter blue or summer white.</li>
<li><i>Working uniforms</i> prioritize comfort and safety first and thus are the least attractive of the Navy uniforms. They are intended for use in underway ships and in occasions that involve dirty, physical labor. Many working uniforms are variations of the service uniforms except with less formal requirements. This category includes Navy coveralls, which are authorized to be worn by members of all ranks.</li>
</ul>
<p>Recently, the Navy completed a project named "Task Force Uniform" to streamline Navy uniforms. Among the changes are that enlisted personnel from <a href="/wiki/Seaman_Recruit.html" title="Seaman Recruit">Seaman Recruit</a> to <a href="/wiki/Petty_Officer_1st_Class.html" title="Petty Officer 1st Class">Petty Officer 1st Class</a> (E1-E6) will have one year-round service uniform instead of Winter Blues and Summer Whites. All personnel from Seaman Recruit to Admiral will also have new working uniforms dubbed Navy Working Uniform (NWU) to replace the wash khakis, coveralls, dungarees, and aviation working greens currently in use. The uniform is a digital patterned camouflage in predominantly haze gray and blue hues.</p>
<p>Grooming for both male and female sailors is regulated to a high degree, with exact standards in regards to hair, facial hair, use of cosmetics, and jewelry. New male recruits are given the military <a href="/wiki/Crew_cut.html" title="Crew cut">crew cut</a> and are prohibited from having hair longer than four inches while in the service. Men are required to be clean shaven at all times, although mustaches are allowed. Women do not have a hair length regulation, however hair cannot fall past the bottom edge of the uniform collar and the style of hair is strictly controlled. Multicolored hair, body piercing, and tattoos on the head are banned for both sexes.<sup id="_ref-34" class="reference"><a  title="">[41]</a></sup></p>

<h2>Relationship with the U.S. Marine Corps</h2>
<p>Historically, the United States Navy has enjoyed a unique relationship with the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Marine_Corps.html" title="United States Marine Corps">United States Marine Corps</a> (USMC), partly because they both specialize in seaborne operations. At the very top level of civilian organization, the USMC is part of the <a href="/wiki/Department_of_the_Navy.html" title="Department of the Navy">Department of the Navy</a> and reports to the <a href="/wiki/Secretary_of_the_Navy.html" title="Secretary of the Navy">Secretary of the Navy</a>. However, it is considered to be a distinct service branch and not a subset of the Navy; the highest ranking Marine officer, the <a href="/wiki/Commandant_of_the_Marine_Corps.html" title="Commandant of the Marine Corps">Commandant of the Marine Corps</a>, does not report to a naval officer unless one happens to be the <a href="/wiki/Chairman_of_the_Joint_Chiefs_of_Staff.html" title="Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff">chairman</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Joint_Chiefs_of_Staff.html" title="Joint Chiefs of Staff">Joint Chiefs of Staff</a>. Marine Corps <a href="/wiki/Medal_of_Honor.html" title="Medal of Honor">Medal of Honor</a> recipients are awarded the Navy variant and Marines are eligible to receive the <a href="/wiki/Navy_Cross.html" title="Navy Cross">Navy Cross</a>. The <a href="/wiki/United_States_Naval_Academy.html" title="United States Naval Academy">United States Naval Academy</a> trains Marine Corps commissioned officers while Navy officers undergo instruction by Marine NCO Drill Instructors, in addition to their normal Recruit Division Commander.</p>
<p>The relationship extends to the operational theater as well. As amphibious assault specialists, Marines often deploy on and attack from Navy vessels; while being transported on a Navy ship, they must obey the orders of its captain. Marine air squadrons operate alongside Navy air squadrons from aircraft carriers, though they frequently have distinct missions and rarely fly sorties together, except to directly support Marine ground troops. The USMC does not train chaplains, <a href="/wiki/Hospital_Corpsmen.html" title="Hospital Corpsmen">Hospital Corpsmen</a> or medical doctors; thus officers and enlisted sailors from the Navy fulfill these roles. They generally wear Marine uniforms that are emblazoned with Navy insignia and markings to distinguish themselves from actual Marines. Corpsmen and chaplains enjoy a great sense of camaraderie with the Marines due in part because they work closely with them and often are embedded with Marine units. They operate under the command of the Marine Corps under the auspices of the <a href="/wiki/Fleet_Marine_Force.html" title="Fleet Marine Force">Fleet Marine Force</a>.</p>
