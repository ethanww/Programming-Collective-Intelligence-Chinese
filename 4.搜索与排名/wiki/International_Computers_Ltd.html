<p>In later years ICL attempted to diversify its product line, but the bulk of its profits always depended on the mainframe customer base. New ventures included marketing a range of powerful IBM clones made by <a href="/wiki/Fujitsu.html" title="Fujitsu">Fujitsu</a>, various minicomputer and personal computer ranges, and (more successfully) a range of retail point-of-sale equipment and back-office software.</p>
<p>ICL was always dependent on large contracts from the UK public sector.

<p><a name="Origins_of_ICL" id="Origins_of_ICL"></a></p>
<h2>Origins of ICL</h2>
<p>International Computers Ltd was formed in <a href="/wiki/1968.html" title="1968">1968</a> as a part of the Industrial Expansion Act of the <a href="/wiki/Harold_Wilson.html" title="Harold Wilson">Wilson</a> <a href="/wiki/Labour_Party_%28UK%29.html" title="Labour Party (UK)">Labour</a> Government. ICL was an initiative of <a href="/wiki/Tony_Benn.html" title="Tony Benn">Tony Benn</a>, the Minister of Technology, to create a British computer industry that could compete with major world manufacturers like <a href="/wiki/IBM.html" title="IBM">IBM</a>. ICL represented the last step in a series of mergers that had taken place in the industry since the late 1950's.</p>
<p>The main portions of ICL were formed by merging <a href="/wiki/International_Computers_and_Tabulators.html" title="International Computers and Tabulators">International Computers and Tabulators</a> (ICT) with EEC, the latter itself a recent merger of <a href="/wiki/Elliott_Automation.html" title="Elliott Automation">Elliott Automation</a>, and <a  class="new" title="EELM">EELM</a>. EELM was itself a merger of the computer divisions of <a href="/wiki/English_Electric.html" title="English Electric">English Electric</a>, <a href="/wiki/LEO_computer.html" title="LEO computer">LEO</a> and <a href="/wiki/Marconi.html" title="Marconi">Marconi</a>.</p>
<p>On its formation the company inherited two main product lines: from ICT the ICT 1900 Series of <a href="/wiki/Mainframe.html" title="Mainframe">mainframes</a>, and from <a href="/wiki/English_Electric_Computers.html" title="English Electric Computers">English Electric Computers</a> (EEC) the System 4, a range of IBM-compatible mainframe clones, based on the <a  class="new" title="RCA Spectra 70">RCA Spectra 70</a>.</p>

<h3>International Computers and Tabulators (ICT)</h3>
<p>ICT was itself the result of a merger of two <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom.html" title="United Kingdom">UK</a> companies that had competed with each other throughout the <a href="/wiki/1930s.html" title="1930s">1930s</a> and <a href="/wiki/1940s.html" title="1940s">1940s</a> during the <a href="/wiki/Punch_card.html" title="Punch card">punch card</a> era: British Tabulating Machines (BTM) and Powers-Samas. ICT had thus emerged with equipment that would process data encoded on punched cards - 40, 80 or 160 column cards in the case of ICT, compared to the 64 or 80 column cards used by IBM and its predecessors. I</p>
<p>In 1962 ICT delivered the first ICT 1300 series computer which was its first transistor machine and also the first to use core memory.</p>
<p>In 1964 ICT purchased the computer division of <a href="/wiki/Ferranti.html" title="Ferranti">Ferranti</a> in another government-forced merger. Ferranti had been building a small number of scientific machines based on various university designs since the 1950s. None of these could be considered commercially successful, however, and Ferranti always seemed to be slow bringing their designs to market.</p>
<p>In 1962 a small team from Ferranti's Canadian subsidiary, <a href="/wiki/Ferranti-Packard.html" title="Ferranti-Packard">Ferranti-Packard</a>, visited the various Ferranti computer labs and saw their work on a next-generation machine. On their return home they produced the <a href="/wiki/Ferranti-Packard_6000.html" title="Ferranti-Packard 6000">Ferranti-Packard 6000</a> in an astonishingly short period of time, developing the machine, <a href="/wiki/Compiler.html" title="Compiler">compilers</a> and an <a href="/wiki/Operating_system.html" title="Operating system">operating system</a> (before these were common) and putting it on the market by 1963. A feature of the Executive operating system was its ability to multi task, using dynamic memory allocation enabled with a magnetic drum as an intermediate random access devise. The machine went on to have some success and sold in small numbers in Canada (Saskatchewan Power Corporation retired serial number 0001 in the early 80's) and the United States.</p>
<p>Meanwhile ICT management in England was looking to rejuvenate their lineup; their latest developments, the ones used to develop the FP 6000, were still not on the market. Management looked at the FP 6000 as well as licensing the <a  class="new" title="RCA Spectra 70">RCA Spectra 70</a>, an <a href="/wiki/IBM_System/360.html" title="IBM System/360">IBM System/360</a>-clone. In the end decided to go with the FP 6000 as the basis for a small line of small-to-midrange machines. The result was the <a href="/wiki/ICT_1900.html" title="ICT 1900">ICT 1900</a> series, which would eventually go on to sell into the thousands.</p>
<p>The 1900 Series, which derived from the Canadian <a href="/wiki/Ferranti-Packard_6000.html" title="Ferranti-Packard 6000">Ferranti-Packard 6000</a>, competed successfully in the UK with the <a href="/wiki/IBM.html" title="IBM">IBM</a> <a href="/wiki/System/360.html" title="System/360">System/360</a> range from the mid 1960s to the mid 1970s. The basic design was based on a 24 bit word, divided up into 6 bit characters. Lower case and control characters were provided for by "shift" characters. The early machines (1904/1905 with hardware Floating Point)) were only 15 bit addressing. Later machines (1904E, 1905E, 1906A) has extended addressing modes up to 22 bits. The operating systems (Executives) were</p>
<ul>
<li>E4BM - the original for the FP 6000 (known internally as the FP1)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>E4RM - a significantly rewritten version of E4BM, with parts of the operating system overlaid to save space.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>E6BM - A rewritten version of E4BM for the later machines with 22 bit addressing.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>E6RM - A rewritten version of E4RM overlay software for the later machines with 22 bit addressing.</li>
</ul>
<p>A later development was GEORGE3, remembered with great affection by a generation of British programmers. It conisted of two elements: an executive (E6G3) based on the older E6BM and GEORGE3 itself, a core and a much larger set of overlays. A later development was GEORGE4 (with E6G4) using the then new techniques of paged hardware. The operating software was written in assembler and a slightly higher level language called GIN, roughly analogous to the commercial ICL language PLAN. The GIN compiler was known as the Ginerator (sic).</p>
<p>A series of smaller machines (1901, 1902, 1903), with their own Executives, were developed by the ICL Stevenage site.</p>

<h3>English Electric LEO Marconi (EELM)</h3>
<p>During the same period of time, LEO was struggling to produce their own machines that would be able to compete with IBM. Their parent company, <a href="/wiki/J._Lyons_and_Co..html" title="J. Lyons and Co.">J. Lyons and Co.</a>, simply didn't have the financial might to develop a new line of machines. Not wanting to see their work go to waste, they sold their computer division to <a href="/wiki/English_Electric.html" title="English Electric">English Electric</a>.</p>
<p>English Electric had developed a series of machines over the years, notably the famous <a href="/wiki/KDF9.html" title="KDF9">KDF9</a>, but never had much commercial success.</p>
<p>Now with serious financial backing at their disposal, the new company nevertheless decided not to come up with their own design, and licensed the Spectra 70 instead (the design ICT rejected). The result was the <a href="/wiki/System_4.html" title="System 4">System 4</a>-series.</p>
<p>The System 4 series ran the J (for Job) operating system. This was a batch operating system, although there was a variant that allowed interactive access called MultiJob. Programming languages used were assembler and <a href="/wiki/COBOL.html" title="COBOL">COBOL</a>. The system was controlled from a console comprised of a mechanical printer and keyboard - very like a Teletype. The assembly language non priviged instruction set was identical to <a href="/wiki/IBM.html" title="IBM">IBM</a> System 360 Assembly Language, in privileged mode there were a few extras.</p>

<h2>New Range</h2>
<ul>
<li>See also: <a href="/wiki/ICL_2900_Series.html" title="ICL 2900 Series">ICL 2900 Series</a>, <a href="/wiki/VME.html" title="VME">VME</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Even before the merger that created ICL was complete, a working party had recommended that the new company should develop a new range of machines offering "acceptable compatibility with the current ranges of both companies". The resulting 2900 Series was launched on 9 October <a href="/wiki/1974.html" title="1974">1974</a>. Its design drew on many sources, one being the Manchester University MU5, and it is still available in the guise of the Fujitsu Trimetra. It ran the <a href="/wiki/VME.html" title="VME">VME</a> <a href="/wiki/Operating_system.html" title="Operating system">operating systems</a>, and supported emulation of both the earlier architectures, either standalone (DME, Direct Machine Environment) or concurrently with <a href="/wiki/Native-mode.html" title="Native-mode">native-mode</a> operation (CME, Concurrent Machine Environment). In the early 1980s ICL struck a deal to acquire semiconductor technology from <a href="/wiki/Fujitsu.html" title="Fujitsu">Fujitsu</a>, on whom they became increasingly dependent as the years progressed. Eventually Fujitsu acquired ICL, and in <a href="/wiki/2002.html" title="2002">2002</a> the residue of the company was rebranded as Fujitsu's <a href="/wiki/European.html" title="European">European</a> services arm.</p>
<p>The term "New Range" was used during development for product line that was eventually launched as the <a href="/wiki/ICL_2900_Series.html" title="ICL 2900 Series">2900 Series</a>, the operating system being known initially as VME/B and later simply as <a href="/wiki/VME.html" title="VME">VME</a>.</p>
<p>The computer hardware included:</p>
<ul>
<li><a  class="new" title="ICL2956">2956</a></li>

<p><a name="Series_39" id="Series_39"></a></p>
<h3>Series 39</h3>
<p>Series 39 followed the same essential architecture as 2900 series, but was a dramatic step forward in hardware technology. It was the first commercial mainframe to exploit optical fibres for central interconnect, and also introduced a multi-CPU (multinode) architecture transparent to the applications.</p>
<p>The series included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Level 50</li>
<li>Level 60</li>
<li>Level 80</li>
</ul>
<p>The training video for the series 39 featured the famous comedy duo <a href="/wiki/House_%28TV_Series%29.html" title="House (TV Series)">House</a> star <a href="/wiki/Hugh_Laurie.html" title="Hugh Laurie">Hugh Laurie</a> and comedian <a href="/wiki/Stephen_Fry.html" title="Stephen Fry">Stephen Fry</a>.</p>

<p><a name="Operating_systems" id="Operating_systems"></a></p>
<h3>Operating systems</h3>
<p>At the inception of New Range development, two operating systems were planned: System B for the large processors, and System D for the mid-range. System B was subsequently renamed <a href="/wiki/VME.html" title="VME">VME/B</a>. A third operating system, System T, was subsequently targeted at small machines. System D was dropped in order to focus efforts on VME/B and System T, renamed to <a href="/wiki/VME/K.html" title="VME/K">VME/K</a> (Confusingly, VME/B was developed in <a href="/wiki/Kidsgrove.html" title="Kidsgrove">Kidsgrove</a>, VME/K in <a href="/wiki/Bracknell.html" title="Bracknell">Bracknell</a>.) The first large machines (the 2980 and 2970) were launched with VME/B. VME/K first saw service on the 2960.</p>
<p>The chief architect of VME/B was <a  class="new" title="Brian Warboys">Brian Warboys</a>, who subsequently became professor of software engineering at the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Manchester.html" title="University of Manchester">University of Manchester</a>.</p>
<p>VME/K development continued independently for several reasons. Early VME/B customers suffered significant performance and reliability problems, and the existence of an alternative product provided a safety net. Perhaps more significantly, VME/K was the brainchild of Ed Mack, who had been brought in by managing director Geoff Cross as ICL's head of research and development. Despite his wide responsibilities, Mack took a detailed personal interest in every aspect of VME/K design. To quote historian Martin Campbell-Kelly, "Mack had a good deal more autonomy than was good for the company." Not only was too much resource going into VME/K at the expense of the VME/B system that ICL's biggest customers were actually using, but the development of mainframe systems was also diverting expenditure from small business systems such as the 2903, whose sales were growing much more rapidly.</p>
<p>ICL's finances deteriorated during the late 1970s, leading to the appointment of a new management team led by Robb Wilmot and Peter Bonfield. One of their first actions was to end VME/K development. This happened just at the time that VME/K had finally reached a level of performance and reliability that made it saleable; however, the customer base was very small, and by this time VME/B (which was renamed VME 2900) had also matured sufficiently to give confidence that it would meet the future requirements for the entire mainframe range.</p>
<p>VME 2900 subsequently became simply VME and then Open VME, and continued to evolve. In 1980 it was marketed as "Your system for the 80s", and indeed that decade proved to be its heydey.

<p><a name="2903_range"></a></p>
<h2>2903 range</h2>
<p>A rapid development to produce a small business computer from, as far as possible, existing hardware and software. It was urgently needed to generate a cash flow that would support continuing 2900 development. The hardware was the 2900 DFC (Disk File Controller) installed in an L-shaped piece of furniture. This contained the system, operator's console, integral printer and disk storage. The 2903 used microcode to emulate 1900 hardware. The operating system was George 1* (a modification of George 1S batch operating system) running on top of the UDAS Executive. In consequence, all the normal 1900 compilers and utilities ran on the 290x range without any changes or recompilation.</p>
<p>There were three models in the range:</p>
<ul>
<li><a  class="new" title="ICL2903">2903</a></li>
<li><a  class="new" title="ICL2904">2904</a></li>
<li><a  class="new" title="ICL2905">2905</a> (limited and was replaced by the <a  class="new" title="ICL2950">2950</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>290x computers would run in an office environment, still quite an innovation for this class of machine, and were a runaway success. Roughly 3000 systems were sold. This was ten times as many as ICL had anticipated.</p>
<ul>
<li>ME29</li>
</ul>
<p>The smaller machines in the 290x family were replaced in about 1982 by the ME29 system.</p>

<h3>Operating systems and Software</h3>
<ul>
<li>Executive</li>
</ul>
<p>The 290x operating system, known as 'Executive', allowed the machines to be operated 'manually' via a video console. GEORGE1* ran on top of Executive to control batch processes by means of JCL (Job Control Language), which was based very closely upon the macro language of the 1900 GEORGE1S operating system.</p>
<ul>
<li>TME (Transaction Machine Environment)</li>
</ul>
<p>TME was the operating system on the ME29 and required CL (Control Language) to run jobs - 'manual' operation being discouraged.</p>
<p>Practically all the software packages available on the 1900 range ran on the 290x and ME29 systems.</p>

<h3>BARIC</h3>
<p>This was a joint venture of International Computer Services Ltd (ICSL), a division of ICL, and Barclays Bank, that provided computer services. In the early days of computing many organizations avoided the capital costs of purchasing their own equipment and the recruitment of technical specialists by putting their work out to service companies which were then known as computer bureaux such as BARIC. This kind of business diminished during the 1980s, only to reappear in the 1990s under a new name - <a href="/wiki/Outsourcing.html" title="Outsourcing">outsourcing</a>. BARIC also ran special groups such as the Advanced Videotext team which looked into how new technologies such as Prestel could be leveraged. This team was based out of Feltham, Middlesex.</p>

<h3>ICIM</h3>
<p>ICL had established a presence in India in its earliest days, through a partly-owned subsidiary International Computers India Manufacturing (ICIM). As the name implies, ICIM took on some of the manufacturing of ICL-designed equipment, generally for overseas markets. In later years ICIM, from its offices in <a href="/wiki/Pune.html" title="Pune">Pune</a>, started to establish a presence in the market for offshore software development and eventially <a href="/wiki/Outsourcing.html" title="Outsourcing">outsourcing</a> of the operation of computer services. ICIM subsequently became a joint operation with Fujitsu, establishing links to Japan that were as strong as its traditional links to the UK. Reflecting the shift in its business, the company was renamed ICIL (International Computers India Limited), and is now <a  class="external text" title="http://www.zensar.com">Zensar</a>.</p>

<h3>Singer Business Machines</h3>
<p>Early in <a href="/wiki/1976.html" title="1976">1976</a> ICL acquired the international (that is, non-US) part of <a href="/wiki/Singer_Corporation.html" title="Singer Corporation">Singer</a> Business Machines. Subsequently ICL also took on the development and manufacturing plant at Utica, New York. The Singer group (best known for their sewing machines) had diversified into computers and in <a href="/wiki/1970.html" title="1970">1970</a> launched the System Ten, a small business minicomputer. The acquisition shifted the geographical balance of ICL's sales away from the UK, and also gave a presence in industry markets such as retail and manufacturing. ICL subsequently developed the System Ten into the System 25, and used the product to spearhead the growth of its Retail Systems business during the 1980s.</p>

<h3>STC</h3>
<p>On 26 July <a href="/wiki/1984.html" title="1984">1984</a> a takeover bid for ICL arrived from Sir <a  class="new" title="Kenneth Corfield">Kenneth Corfield</a>, head of <a href="/wiki/Standard_Telephones_and_Cables.html" title="Standard Telephones and Cables">Standard Telephones and Cables</a>. The stated rationale was the predicted convergence of computers and telecommunications. To the bemusement of many ICL staff, Corfield also announced that he thought ICL's marketing skills would complement STC's technical strengths. The ICL board recommended acceptance of the bid, and the takeover was completed on 10 Sept <a href="/wiki/1984.html" title="1984">1984</a>. Sir <a href="/wiki/Michael_Edwardes.html" title="Michael Edwardes">Michael Edwardes</a>, who had been chairman for just six months, resigned; <a  class="new" title="Robb Wilmot">Robb Wilmot</a> became Chairman at the age of only 36, and <a  class="new" title="Peter Bonfield">Peter Bonfield</a> managing director.</p>
<p>The merger was soon followed by a financial crisis in STC, leading to Corfield's replacement by Lord Keith as chairman, and Arthur Walsh as chief executive. Wilmot resigned, and Peter Bonfield was appointed chairman and managing director of ICL. Within a few years ICL was contributing 60% of the profits and turnover of the combined group. Wilmot was created a <a href="/wiki/Order_of_the_British_Empire.html" title="Order of the British Empire">CBE</a> for his role in turning the company around.</p>

<h3>Nokia Data</h3>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/1991.html" title="1991">1991</a> ICL acquired Nokia Data, part of the Finnish <a href="/wiki/Nokia.html" title="Nokia">Nokia Group</a>. Nokia Data was itself the result of Nokia's mid-<a href="/wiki/1980s.html" title="1980s">1980s</a> acquisition of Ericsson Information Systems, whose origins lay in the purchase by <a href="/wiki/Ericsson.html" title="Ericsson">Ericsson</a> of the computer business of <a href="/wiki/Saab.html" title="Saab">Saab</a>, known as Datasaab. ICL's acquisition (at a price of around £250m) added 9500 employees to the company (7000 of them in <a href="/wiki/Finland.html" title="Finland">Finland</a> and <a href="/wiki/Sweden.html" title="Sweden">Sweden</a>), and brought with it a <a href="/wiki/Personal_Computer.html" title="Personal Computer">PC</a> manufacturing capability, a suite of desktop software products, and more importantly a strong presence in the <a href="/wiki/Nordic_countries.html" title="Nordic countries">Nordic</a> market and an awareness of the high-volume end of the IT market.</p>

<p><a name="Fujitsu" id="Fujitsu"></a></p>
<h3>Fujitsu</h3>
<p>ICL's relationship with <a href="/wiki/Fujitsu.html" title="Fujitsu">Fujitsu</a> started in <a href="/wiki/1981.html" title="1981">1981</a>, when ICL needed a cheaper source of technology to develop lower-end machines in the 2900 range to compete with the <a href="/wiki/IBM_4300_series.html" title="IBM 4300 series">IBM 4300 series</a>. At this stage ICL was developing its own LSI technology for use in the higher-end machines, designed as a successor to the highly-successful 2966 processor (known internally as S3). ICL had visited a number of companies during <a href="/wiki/1980.html" title="1980">1980</a> including Fujitsu and <a href="/wiki/Hitachi.html" title="Hitachi">Hitachi</a> to identify potential suppliers.</p>
<p>In early <a href="/wiki/1981.html" title="1981">1981</a> ICL ran into a financial crisis, leading to a full takeover bid from <a href="/wiki/Univac.html" title="Univac">Univac</a>; but the British Government stepped in with a loan guarantee, enabling the company to stay independent. As part of this rescue agreement, <a  class="new" title="Robb Wilmot">Robb Wilmot</a> arrived as CEO in May <a href="/wiki/1981.html" title="1981">1981</a>.</p>
<p>Wilmot cancelled ICL in-house <a href="/wiki/LSI.html" title="LSI">LSI</a> technology development, and negotiated an agreement that gave access to Fujitsu's LSI and packaging technologies, which, when combined with ICL's in-house CAD capability, enabled ICL to design and manafacture the DM1 and Estriel machines, later marketed very profitably as Series 39 level 30 and 80.</p>
<p>Initially the collaboration with Fujitsu was presented as being an arm's length one, to avoid diluting ICL's credentials as a European and British company. However, Fujitsu's involvement with ICL at both the financial and the technical level steadily increased over the subsequent two decades, leading first to 100% ownership and subsequently to the full integration of ICL into the Fujitsu company and the dropping of the ICL brand.</p>
