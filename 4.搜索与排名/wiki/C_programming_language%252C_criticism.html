			<p>The <b><a href="/wiki/C_%28programming_language%29.html" title="C (programming language)">C programming language</a></b> is a very widely used programming language, minimalistic and low-level by design. Despite its popularity, C's characteristics have led to much <b>criticism</b> of the language. Some criticisms have arisen from misconceptions or misinterpretations of the C standard, while others have some degree of validity. This article is concerned with the latter.</p>
<p>Many beginning programmers have difficulty learning C's syntax and peculiarities, and even many expert programmers find C programs difficult to maintain and debug. A popular saying, repeated by such notable language designers as <a href="/wiki/Bjarne_Stroustrup.html" title="Bjarne Stroustrup">Bjarne Stroustrup</a>, is that "C makes it easy to shoot yourself in the foot." <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.research.att.com/~bs/bs_faq.html#really-say-that">[1]</a> In other words, C permits many operations that are generally not desirable, and thus many simple programming errors are not detected by the compiler and may not even be readily apparent at runtime. This potentially leads to programs with unpredictable behavior and security holes, if sufficient care and discipline are not used in programming and maintenance.</p>
<p>The designers wanted to avoid compile- and run-time checks that were too expensive when C was first implemented. With time, external tools were developed to perform some of these checks. Nothing prevents an implementation from providing such checks, but nothing requires it to, either. The safe C dialect <a href="/wiki/Cyclone_programming_language.html" title="Cyclone programming language">Cyclone</a> addresses some of these concerns.</p>
<p>Kernighan and Ritchie made reference to the basic design philosophy of C in their response to criticism of C not being a strongly-typed language<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a  title="">[1]</a></sup>: "Nevertheless, C retains the basic philosophy that programmers know what they are doing; it only requires that they state their intentions explicitly."<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a  title="">[2]</a></sup></p>

<p><a name="Memory_allocation" id="Memory_allocation"></a></p>
<h3>Memory allocation</h3>
<p>One issue to be aware of when using C is that automatically and dynamically allocated objects are not necessarily initialized (depending on what facility is used to allocate memory); they initially have an indeterminate value (typically whatever values are present in the memory space they occupy, which might not even be a legal bit pattern for that type). This value is highly unpredictable and can vary between two machines, two program runs, or even two calls to the same function. If the program attempts to use such an uninitialized value, the results are undefined. Many modern compilers try to detect and warn about this problem, but both false positives and false negatives occur.</p>
<p>Another common problem is that heap memory has to be manually synchronized with its actual usage in any program for it to be correctly reused as much as possible. For example, if an automatic pointer variable goes out of scope or has its value overwritten while still referencing a particular allocation that is not freed via a call to <code><a href="/wiki/Malloc.html" title="Malloc">free()</a></code>, then that memory cannot be recovered for later reuse and is essentially lost to the program, a phenomenon known as <i><a href="/wiki/Memory_leak.html" title="Memory leak">memory leak</a>.</i> Conversely, it is possible to release memory too soon, and in some cases continue to be able to use it, but since the allocation system can re-allocate the memory at any time for unrelated reasons, this results in unpredictable behavior, typically manifested in portions of the program far removed from the erroneously written segment. Such issues are ameliorated in languages with <a href="/wiki/Garbage_collection_%28computer_science%29.html" title="Garbage collection (computer science)">automatic garbage collection</a> or <a href="/wiki/Resource_acquisition_is_initialization.html" title="Resource acquisition is initialization">RAII</a>.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Pointers">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Pointers" id="Pointers"></a></p>
<h3>Pointers</h3>
<p>Pointers are a primary source of potential danger. Because they are typically unchecked, a pointer can be made to point to any arbitrary location (even within code), causing unpredictable effects. Although properly-used pointers point to safe places, they can be moved to unsafe places using pointer arithmetic; the memory they point to may be deallocated and reused (<a href="/wiki/Dangling_pointer.html" title="Dangling pointer">dangling pointers</a>); they may be uninitialized (<a href="/wiki/Wild_pointer.html" title="Wild pointer">wild pointers</a>); or they may be directly assigned a value using a cast, union, or through another corrupt pointer. In general, C is permissive in allowing manipulation of and conversion between pointer types, although compilers typically provide options for various levels of checking. Other languages attempt to address these problems by using more restrictive <a href="/wiki/Reference_%28computer_science%29.html" title="Reference (computer science)">reference</a> types.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Arrays">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Arrays" id="Arrays"></a></p>
<h3>Arrays</h3>
<p>Although C supports static arrays, it is not required that array indexes be validated (<a href="/wiki/Bounds_checking.html" title="Bounds checking">bounds checking</a>). For example, one can write to the sixth element of an array with five elements, yielding generally undesirable results. This type of bug, called a <i><a href="/wiki/Buffer_overflow.html" title="Buffer overflow">buffer overflow</a>,</i> has been notorious as the source of a number of security problems. On the other hand, since <a href="/wiki/Bounds_checking_elimination.html" title="Bounds checking elimination">bounds checking elimination</a> technology was largely nonexistent when C was defined, bounds checking came with a severe performance penalty, particularly in numerical computation. By comparison, a few years earlier some <a href="/wiki/Fortran.html" title="Fortran">Fortran</a> compilers had a switch to toggle bounds checking on or off; however, this would have been much less useful for C, where array arguments are passed as simple pointers.</p>
<p>Multidimensional arrays are commonly used in numerical algorithms (mainly from applied linear algebra) to store matrices. The structure of the C array is particularly well suited to this particular task, provided one remembers to count indices starting from 0 instead of 1. This issue is discussed in the book <i><a href="/wiki/Numerical_Recipes.html" title="Numerical Recipes">Numerical Recipes in C</a></i>, chapter 1.2, page 20<i>ff</i> (<a  class="external text" title="http://www.library.cornell.edu/nr/bookcpdf/c1-2.pdf">read online</a>). In that book there is also a solution based on negative indexing which introduces other dangers. Starting indices at 0 has been assimilated into the computing culture, and is no longer as alien a notion as it seemed when C was first introduced.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Variadic functions">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Variadic_functions" id="Variadic_functions"></a></p>
<h3>Variadic functions</h3>
<p>Another source of bugs is <a href="/wiki/Variadic_function.html" title="Variadic function">variadic functions</a>, which take a variable number of arguments. Unlike other prototyped C functions, checking the types of arguments to variadic functions at compile-time is, in general, impossible without additional information. If the wrong type of data is passed, the effect is unpredictable, and often fatal. Variadic functions also handle null pointer constants in a way which is often surprising to those unfamiliar with the language semantics. For example, NULL must be cast to the desired pointer type when passed to a variadic function. The <a href="/wiki/Printf.html" title="Printf">printf</a> family of functions supplied by the standard library, used to generate formatted text output, has been noted for its error-prone variadic interface, which relies on a format string to specify the number and types of trailing arguments.</p>
<p>However, type-checking of variadic functions from the standard library is a quality-of-implementation issue; many modern compilers do type-check <code>printf</code> calls, producing warnings if the argument list is inconsistent with the format string. Even so, not all <code>printf</code> calls can be checked statically since the format string can be built at runtime, and other variadic functions typically remain unchecked.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Syntax">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Syntax" id="Syntax"></a></p>
<h3>Syntax</h3>
<p>Although mimicked by many languages because of its widespread familiarity, C's syntax has been often targeted as one of its weakest points. For example, Kernighan and Ritchie say in the second edition of <i>The C Programming Language</i>, "C, like any other language, has its blemishes. Some of the operators have the wrong precedence; some parts of the syntax could be better." Bjarne Stroustrup said of C++ (which is superficially similar to C): "Within C++, there is a much smaller and cleaner language struggling to get out. […] the C++ semantics is much cleaner than its syntax." <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.research.att.com/~bs/bs_faq.html#really-say-that">[2]</a> Some specific problems worth noting are:</p>
<ul>
<li>A function prototype with an empty parameter list allows any set of parameters, a syntax problem introduced for backward compatibility with K&amp;R C, which lacked prototypes.</li>
<li>Some questionable choices of operator precedence, as mentioned by Kernighan and Ritchie above, such as <code>==</code> binding more tightly than <code>&amp;</code> and <code>|</code> in expressions like <code>x &amp; 1 == 0</code>.</li>
<li>The use of the <code>=</code> operator, used in mathematics for equality, to indicate assignment. Ritchie made this syntax design decision consciously, based primarily on the argument that assignment occurs more often than comparison. However, as explained by computer scientist Damian Conway in his "Seven Deadly Sins of Introductory Programming Language Design": "Many students, when confronted with this operator, become confused as to the nature of assignment and its relationship to equality. […] [A different syntax] seems to evoke less confusion, [because it] reinforces the notion of procedural <i>transfer</i> of value, rather than transitive <i>equality</i> of value.".<a  class="external autonumber" title="http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/mciver96seven.html">[3]</a></li>
<li>Similarly, the similarity of the assignment and equality operators (<code>=</code> and <code>==</code>) makes it easy to substitute one for the other, and C's weak type system permits each to be used in the context of the other without a compilation error (although some compilers produce warnings).<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a  title="">[3]</a></sup> <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cs.ucr.edu/~nxiao/cs10/errors.htm">[4]</a></li>
<li>A lack of <a href="/wiki/Infix_notation.html" title="Infix notation">infix</a> operators for complex objects, particularly for string operations, making programs which rely heavily on these operations difficult to read. The <a href="/wiki/Lisp_programming_language.html" title="Lisp programming language">Lisp</a> language, with no infix operators whatsoever, exhibits this problem to an even greater extent.</li>
<li>Heavy reliance on punctuation-based symbols even where this is arguably less clear, such as "&amp;&amp;" and "||" instead of "and" and "or," respectively. Some are also confused about the difference between bit-wise operators ("&amp;" and "|") and logical operators ("&amp;&amp;" and "||").</li>
<li>Unintuitive declaration syntax, particularly for function pointers. In the words of language researcher <a href="/wiki/Damian_Conway.html" title="Damian Conway">Damian Conway</a> speaking about the very similar C++ declaration syntax:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Specifying a type in C++ is made difficult by the fact that some of the components of a declaration (such as the pointer specifier) are prefix operators while others (such as the array specifier) are postfix. These declaration operators are also of varying precedence, necessitating careful bracketing to achieve the desired declaration. Furthermore, if the type ID is to apply to an identifier, this identifier ends up at somewhere between these operators, and is therefore obscured in even moderately complicated examples (see Appendix A for instance). The result is that the clarity of such declarations is greatly diminished. <i>Ben Werther &amp; Damian Conway. <a  class="external text" title="http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~damian/papers/HTML/ModestProposal.html#section3.1.1">A Modest Proposal: C++ Resyntaxed</a>. Section 3.1.1. 1996.</i></p>

<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Economy of expression[4]">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Economy_of_expression.07UNIQ2136c1ad60e00c2b-nowiki-0000001F-QINU4.07UNIQ2136c1ad60e00c2b-nowiki-00000020-QINU" id="Economy_of_expression.07UNIQ2136c1ad60e00c2b-nowiki-0000001F-QINU4.07UNIQ2136c1ad60e00c2b-nowiki-00000020-QINU"></a></p>
<h3>Economy of expression<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a  title="">[4]</a></sup></h3>
<p>One occasional criticism of C is that it can be concise to the point of being cryptic. A classic example that appears in K&amp;R<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a  title="">[5]</a></sup> is the following function to copy the contents of string <code>t</code> to string <code>s</code>:</p>
<pre>
void strcpy(char *s, char *t)
{
    while (*s++ = *t++);
}
</pre>
<p>In this example, <code>t</code> is a pointer to a null-terminated array of characters, <code>s</code> is a pointer to an array of characters. Every loop of the single <code>while</code> statement does the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Copies the character pointed to by <code>t</code> (initially set to point to the first character of the string to be copied) to the corresponding character position pointed to by <code>s</code> (initially set to point to the first character of the character array to be copied to)</li>
<li>Advances the pointers <code>s</code> and <code>t</code> to point to the next character. Note that the values of <code>s</code> and <code>t</code> can safely be changed, because they are local <i>copies</i> of the pointers to the corresponding arrays</li>
<li>Tests whether the character copied (the result of the assignment statement) is a null character signifying the end of the string. Note that the test could have been written "<code>((*s++ = *t++) != '\0')</code>" (where <code>'\0'</code> is the null character); however, in C, a Boolean test is actually a test for any non-zero value; consequently the test is true as long as the character is any character other than a string-terminating null</li>
<li>As long as the character is not a null, the condition is true, causing the <code>while</code> loop to repeat. (In particular, because the character copy occurs before the condition is evaluated, the final terminating null is guaranteed to be copied as well)</li>
<li>The repeatedly executed body of the <code>while</code> loop is an empty statement, signified by the semicolon (which despite appearances is not part of the <code>while</code> syntax). (It is not uncommon for the body of <code>while</code> or <code>for</code> loops to be empty.)</li>
</ul>
<p>The above code is functionally equivalent to:</p>
<pre>
void strcpy(char *s, char *t)
{
    char aux;
    do {
        *s = *t;
        aux = *s;
        s++;
        t++;
    } while (aux != '\0');
}
</pre>
<p>In a modern optimising compiler, these two pieces of code produce identical assembly code, so the smaller code does not produce smaller output. In more verbose languages such as <a href="/wiki/Pascal_programming_language.html" title="Pascal programming language">Pascal</a>, a similar iteration would require several statements. For C programmers, the economy of style is idiomatic and leads to shorter expressions; for critics, being able to do too much with a single line of C code can lead to problems in comprehension.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Internal Consistency">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Internal_Consistency" id="Internal_Consistency"></a></p>
<h3>Internal Consistency</h3>
<p>Some features of C, its preprocessor, and/or implementation are inconsistent. One of C's features is three distinct classes of non-wide string literals. One is for run-time data, another is for include files with quotation marks around the filename, and the third is for include filenames in angle brackets. The allowed symbol set, and the interpretation of them, is not consistent between the three. To some extent this arose from the need to accommodate a wide variety of file naming conventions, such as <a href="/wiki/MS-DOS.html" title="MS-DOS">MS-DOS</a>'s use of backslash as a path separator.</p>
<p>Another consistency problem stems from shortcomings in C's preprocessor, which was originally implemented as a separate, relatively simple, process only loosely connected with the semantics of the rest of the language. The following code is legal Standard C:</p>
<pre>
int sixteen = 0x3e-0x2e;
</pre>
<p>Unfortunately, a Standard C preprocessor will convert "0x3e-0x2e" to a single preprocessing token, and the subsequent conversion of that to a token in a later phase of translation is ill-defined, so the compiler might not obtain the intended tokenization of</p>
<pre>
int sixteen = 0x3e - 0x2e ;
</pre>
<p>even though spaces around the minus sign would not otherwise be required.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Standardization">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Standardization" id="Standardization"></a></p>
<h3>Standardization</h3>
<p>The C programming language was standardized by <a href="/wiki/ANSI.html" title="ANSI">ANSI</a> in 1989 and adopted as an <a href="/wiki/ISO.html" title="ISO">ISO</a> standard in 1990; the standard has subsequently been extended twice. Some features of the C standard, such as trigraphs and complex arithmetic, have been challenged on the ground of questionable user demand. Some major C compilers have not yet become fully conformant to later versions of the C standard.</p>
<p>The C standards have been accompanied by Rationale documents which describe the considerations behind many of the choices made by the standards committee. Frequently there were trade-offs among competing requirements, and not everybody weights the factors the same as did the C standards committee.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Maintenance">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Maintenance" id="Maintenance"></a></p>
<h3>Maintenance</h3>
<p>There are other problems in C that don't directly result in bugs or errors, but make it harder for programmers to build a robust, maintainable, large-scale system. Examples of these include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A fragile system for importing definitions (<code>#include</code>) that relies on literal text inclusion and redundantly keeping prototypes and function definitions in sync, and increases build times.</li>
<li>A cumbersome compilation model that complicates dependency tracking and <a href="/wiki/Compiler_optimization.html" title="Compiler optimization">compiler optimizations</a> between modules.</li>
<li>A weak type system that lets many clearly erroneous programs compile without errors.</li>
</ul>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Tools for mitigating issues with C">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Tools_for_mitigating_issues_with_C" id="Tools_for_mitigating_issues_with_C"></a></p>
<h3>Tools for mitigating issues with C</h3>
<p>Tools have been created to help C programmers avoid these problems in many cases.</p>
<p>Automated source code checking and auditing are beneficial in any language, and for C many such tools exist, such as <a href="/wiki/Lint_programming_tool.html" title="Lint programming tool">Lint</a>. A common practice is to use Lint to detect questionable code when a program is first written. Once a program passes Lint, it is then compiled using the C compiler.</p>
<p>There are also compilers, libraries and operating system level mechanisms for performing array bounds checking, <a href="/wiki/Buffer_overflow.html" title="Buffer overflow">buffer overflow</a> detection, and <a href="/wiki/Garbage_collection_%28computer_science%29.html" title="Garbage collection (computer science)">automatic garbage collection</a>, that are not a standard part of C.</p>
<p>Many compilers, most notably Visual C++, deal with the long compilation times inflicted by header file inclusion using <i>precompiled headers</i>, a system where declarations are stored in an intermediate format that is quick to parse. Building the precompiled header files in the first place is expensive, but this is generally done only for system header files, which are larger and more numerous than most application header files and also change much less often.</p>
<p><a  class="new" title="Cproto">Cproto</a> is a program that will read a C source file and output prototypes of all the functions within the source file. This program can be used in conjunction with the "make" command to create new files containing prototypes each time the source file has been changed. These prototype files can be included by the original source file (e.g., as "filename.p"), which reduces the problems of keeping function definitions and source files in agreement.</p>
<p>It should be recognized that these tools are not a panacea. Because of C's flexibility, some types of errors involving misuse of variadic functions, out-of-bounds array indexing, and incorrect memory management cannot be detected on some architectures without incurring a significant performance penalty. However, some common cases can be recognized and accounted for.</p>
<p>Not every programmer needs a tool to deal with every concern. There are many C programmers who aren't prone to memory leaks, know when to check for buffer overflow, have no uncertainty about <code>=</code> vs. <code>==</code>, know the prededence and associativity of operators by heart, never resort to redundant parentheses, use strtok() within its limits, <i>etc.</i></p>
