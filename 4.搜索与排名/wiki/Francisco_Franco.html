<p><a name="Early_life" id="Early_life"></a></p>
<h2>Early life</h2>
<p>Franco was born in <a href="/wiki/Ferrol%2C_A_Coru%C3%B1a.html" title="Ferrol, A Coruña">El Ferrol</a>, <a href="/wiki/Galicia.html" title="Galicia">Galicia</a>, <a href="/wiki/Spain.html" title="Spain">Spain</a> (between 1938 and 1982 his hometown would be known officially as <i>El Ferrol del Caudillo</i>). His father, Nicolás Franco Salgado-Araujo, was a <a href="/wiki/Navy.html" title="Navy">Navy</a> paymaster and a violent <a href="/wiki/Alcoholism.html" title="Alcoholism">alcoholic</a> who mistreated his family. His mother, Pilar Bahamonde Pardo de Andrade, also came from a family with naval tradition. His siblings included Nicolás, navy officer and diplomat, Pilar, a well-known socialite, and <a href="/wiki/Ram%C3%B3n_Franco.html" title="Ramón Franco">Ramón</a>, a pioneering aviator who was hated by many of Francisco Franco's supporters.</p>
<p>Francisco was to follow his father into the navy, but entry into the Naval Academy was closed from 1906 to 1913. To his father's chagrin, he decided to join the army. In 1907, he entered the Infantry Academy in <a href="/wiki/Toledo%2C_Spain.html" title="Toledo, Spain">Toledo</a>, where he graduated in 1910. He was commissioned as a <a href="/wiki/Second_lieutenant.html" title="Second lieutenant">second lieutenant</a>. Two years later, he obtained a commission to <a href="/wiki/Morocco.html" title="Morocco">Morocco</a>. Spanish efforts to physically occupy their new <a href="/wiki/African.html" title="African">African</a> <a href="/wiki/Protectorate.html" title="Protectorate">protectorate</a> provoked a <a href="/wiki/Rif_War_%281920%29.html" title="Rif War (1920)">long protracted war</a> (from 1909 to 1927) with native Moroccans. Tactics at the time resulted in heavy losses among Spanish <a href="/wiki/Officer_%28armed_forces%29.html" title="Officer (armed forces)">military officers</a>, but also gave the chance of earning promotion through <a href="/wiki/Merit.html" title="Merit">merit</a>. This explains the saying that officers would get either <i>la caja o la faja</i> (a coffin or a general's sash).</p>
<p>Franco soon gained a reputation as a good officer. He joined the newly formed <a href="/wiki/Regulares.html" title="Regulares">regulares</a> <a href="/wiki/Colonial.html" title="Colonial">colonial</a> native troops with Spanish officers, who acted as <a href="/wiki/Shock_troops.html" title="Shock troops">shock troops</a>.</p>
<p>In 1916, at the age of 23 and already a <a href="/wiki/Captain.html" title="Captain">captain</a>, he was badly wounded in a <a href="/wiki/Skirmish.html" title="Skirmish">skirmish</a> at <i>El Biutz</i>. This action marked him permanently in the eyes of the native troops as a man of <i><a href="/wiki/Baraka.html" title="Baraka">baraka</a></i> (good luck). He was also proposed unsuccessfully for Spain's highest honor for gallantry, the coveted <i>Cruz Laureada de San Fernando</i>. Instead, he was promoted to <a href="/wiki/Major.html" title="Major">major</a> (comandante), becoming the youngest <a href="/wiki/Staff_officer.html" title="Staff officer">staff officer</a> in the Spanish Army.</p>
<p>From 1917 to 1920, he was posted on the Spanish mainland. That last year, Lieutenant Colonel <a href="/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Mill%C3%A1n_Astray.html" title="José Millán Astray">José Millán Astray</a>, a <a href="/wiki/Histrionic.html" title="Histrionic">histrionic</a> but <a href="/wiki/Charismatic.html" title="Charismatic">charismatic</a> officer, founded the <i><a href="/wiki/Spanish_Foreign_Legion.html" title="Spanish Foreign Legion">Legión Extranjera</a></i>, along similar lines to the <a href="/wiki/French_Foreign_Legion.html" title="French Foreign Legion">French Foreign Legion</a>. Franco became the <i>Legión's</i> second-in-command and returned to Africa.</p>
<p>In summer 1921, the overextended Spanish army suffered (<a href="/wiki/July_24.html" title="July 24">July 24</a>) a <a href="/wiki/Disaster_of_Annual.html" title="Disaster of Annual">crushing defeat</a> at <a href="/wiki/Annual_%28Morocco%29.html" title="Annual (Morocco)">Annual</a> at the hands of the <a href="/wiki/Rif.html" title="Rif">Rif</a> tribes led by the <a href="/wiki/Abd_el-Krim.html" title="Abd el-Krim">Abd el-Krim</a> brothers. The <i>Legión</i> symbolically, if not materially, saved the Spanish enclave of <a href="/wiki/Melilla.html" title="Melilla">Melilla</a> after a gruelling three-day forced march led by Franco. In 1923, already a <a href="/wiki/Lieutenant_colonel.html" title="Lieutenant colonel">lieutenant colonel</a>, he was made commander of the <i>Legión</i>.</p>
<p>The same year, he married María del <a href="/wiki/Carmen_Polo.html" title="Carmen Polo">Carmen Polo y Martínez Valdés</a> and they had one child, a daughter, <a href="/wiki/Carmen_Franco_y_Polo.html" title="Carmen Franco y Polo">María del Carmen</a>, born in 1926.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a  title="">[2]</a></sup> As a special mark of honor, his <a href="/wiki/Best_man.html" title="Best man">best man</a> (padrino) at the wedding was King <a href="/wiki/Alfonso_XIII_of_Spain.html" title="Alfonso XIII of Spain">Alfonso XIII</a>, a fact which would mark him, during the <a href="/wiki/Second_Spanish_Republic.html" title="Second Spanish Republic">Republic</a> as a monarchical officer.</p>
<p>Promoted to <a href="/wiki/Colonel.html" title="Colonel">colonel</a>, Franco led the first wave of troops ashore at <a href="/wiki/Alhucemas.html" title="Alhucemas">Alhucemas</a> in 1925. This landing in the heartland of Abd el-Krim's tribe, combined with the French invasion from the south, spelled the beginning of the end for the shortlived <a href="/wiki/Republic_of_the_Rif.html" title="Republic of the Rif">Republic of the Rif</a>.</p>
<p>Becoming the youngest <a href="/wiki/General.html" title="General">general</a> in Spain in 1926, Franco was appointed in 1928 director of the newly created <i>Joint Military Academy</i> in <a href="/wiki/Zaragoza.html" title="Zaragoza">Zaragoza</a>, a common college for all Army <a href="/wiki/Cadets.html" title="Cadets">cadets</a>.</p>

<h2>During the Second Spanish Republic</h2>
<p>At the fall of the monarchy in 1931, in keeping with his prior apolitical record, he did not take any remarkable attitude. But the closing of the Academy, in June, by then War Minister <a href="/wiki/Manuel_Aza%C3%B1a.html" title="Manuel Azaña">Manuel Azaña</a>, provoked the first clash with the Republic. Azaña found Franco's farewell speech to the cadets<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a  title="">[3]</a></sup> insulting, resulting in Franco being without a post for six months, and under surveillance.</p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/February_5.html" title="February 5">February 5</a>, <a href="/wiki/1932.html" title="1932">1932</a>, he was given a command in <a href="/wiki/La_Coru%C3%B1a.html" title="La Coruña">La Coruña</a>. Franco avoided being involved in <a href="/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Sanjurjo.html" title="José Sanjurjo">José Sanjurjo</a>'s attempted <i>coup</i> that year. As a side result of Azaña's military reform, in January 1933, Franco was relegated from the first to the 24th in the list of Brigadiers; conversely, the same year (<a href="/wiki/February_17.html" title="February 17">February 17</a>), he was given the military command of the <a href="/wiki/Balearic_Islands.html" title="Balearic Islands">Balearic Islands</a>—a post above his rank.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: The Asturias Uprising">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="The_Asturias_Uprising" id="The_Asturias_Uprising"></a></p>
<h3>The Asturias Uprising</h3>
<p>New elections were held in October 1933, which resulted in a center-right majority. In opposition to this government, a <a href="/wiki/Anarchism_in_Spain#Prelude_to_Revolution.html" title="Anarchism in Spain">revolutionary movement</a> broke out <a href="/wiki/October_5.html" title="October 5">October 5</a>, <a href="/wiki/1934.html" title="1934">1934</a>. This attempt was rapidly quelled in most of the country, but gained a stronghold in <a href="/wiki/Asturias.html" title="Asturias">Asturias</a>, with the support of the <a href="/wiki/Miner.html" title="Miner">miners</a>' unions. Franco, already general of a Division and assessor to the war minister, was put in command of the operations directed to suppress the insurgency. The forces of the Army in Africa were to carry the brunt of this, with General <a href="/wiki/Eduardo_L%C3%B3pez_Ochoa.html" title="Eduardo López Ochoa">Eduardo López Ochoa</a> as commander in the field. After two weeks of heavy fighting (and a death toll estimated between 1,200 and 2,000), the rebellion was suppressed.</p>
<p>The uprising and, in general, the events that led over the next two years to the civil war, are still under heavy debate (between, for example, <a  class="new" title="Enrique Moradiellos">Enrique Moradiellos</a> and <a  class="new" title="Pio Moa">Pio Moa</a>.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a  title="">[4]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a  title="">[5]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a  title="">[6]</a></sup> Nonetheless, it is universally agreed that the insurgency in Asturias sharpened the antagonism between Left and Right. Franco and López Ochoa—who up to that moment was seen as a left-leaning officer—were marked by the left as enemies. López Ochoa was persecuted, decapitated, his head stuck on a broomstick and paraded in the streets at the start of the war.</p>
<p>Some time after these events, Franco was briefly commander-in-chief of the Army of Africa (from <a href="/wiki/February_15.html" title="February 15">February 15</a> onwards), and from <a href="/wiki/May_19.html" title="May 19">May 19</a>, <a href="/wiki/1935.html" title="1935">1935</a> on, <a href="/wiki/Chief_of_the_General_Staff.html" title="Chief of the General Staff">Chief of the General Staff</a>, the top military post in Spain.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: The drift to war">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="The_drift_to_war" id="The_drift_to_war"></a></p>
<h3>The drift to war</h3>
<p>After the ruling coalition collapsed amid the <a href="/wiki/Straperlo.html" title="Straperlo">Straperlo</a> corruption scandal, new elections were scheduled. Two wide coalitions formed: the <a href="/wiki/Popular_Front_%28Spain%29.html" title="Popular Front (Spain)">Popular Front</a> on the left, with Republicans to the Communists, and the <a href="/wiki/Frente_Nacional.html" title="Frente Nacional">Frente Nacional</a> on the right, with the center <a href="/wiki/Radicalism.html" title="Radicalism">radicals</a> to the conservative <a href="/wiki/Carlism.html" title="Carlism">Carlists</a>. On <a href="/wiki/February_16.html" title="February 16">February 16</a>, <a href="/wiki/1936.html" title="1936">1936</a>, the left won by a narrow margin.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a  title="">[7]</a></sup> The days after were marked by near-chaotic circumstances. Franco lobbied unsuccessfully to have a state of emergency declared, with the stated purpose of quelling the disturbances and allowing an orderly vote recount. Instead, on <a href="/wiki/February_23.html" title="February 23">February 23</a>, Franco was sent away to be military commander of the <a href="/wiki/Canary_Islands.html" title="Canary Islands">Canary Islands</a>, a distant place with few troops under his command.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a conspiracy led by <a href="/wiki/Emilio_Mola.html" title="Emilio Mola">Emilio Mola</a> was taking shape. Franco was contacted, but maintained an ambiguous attitude almost up until July. On <a href="/wiki/June_23.html" title="June 23">June 23</a>, <a href="/wiki/1936.html" title="1936">1936</a>, he even wrote to the head of the government, <a href="/wiki/Casares_Quiroga.html" title="Casares Quiroga">Casares Quiroga</a>, offering to quell the discontent in the army, but was not answered. The other rebels were determined to go ahead, whether <i>con Paquito o sin Paquito</i> (with Franco or without him) ,as said by <a href="/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Sanjurjo.html" title="José Sanjurjo">José Sanjurjo</a> the honorary leader of the military uprising . After various postponements, <a href="/wiki/July_18.html" title="July 18">July 18</a> was fixed as the date of the uprising. The situation reached a point of no return and, as presented to Franco by Mola, the coup was unavoidable and he had to choose a side. He decided to join the rebels and was given the task of commanding the <a href="/wiki/Army_of_Africa.html" title="Army of Africa">Army of Africa</a>. A privately owned DH 89 <a href="/wiki/De_Havilland_Dragon_Rapide.html" title="De Havilland Dragon Rapide">De Havilland Dragon Rapide</a>, (still referred to in Spain as <i>the</i> <a href="/wiki/Dragon.html" title="Dragon">Dragon</a> Rapide), was chartered in <a href="/wiki/England.html" title="England">England</a> <a href="/wiki/July_11.html" title="July 11">July 11</a> to take him to <a href="/wiki/Africa.html" title="Africa">Africa</a>.</p>
<p>The assassination of the right-wing opposition leader <a href="/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Calvo_Sotelo.html" title="José Calvo Sotelo">José Calvo Sotelo</a> by government police troops (quite possibly acting on their own, as in the case of <a href="/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Castillo_%28Spanish_Civil_War%29.html" title="José Castillo (Spanish Civil War)">José Castillo</a>) precipitated the uprising. On <a href="/wiki/July_17.html" title="July 17">July 17</a>, one day earlier than planned, the African Army rebelled, detaining their commanders. On <a href="/wiki/July_18.html" title="July 18">July 18</a>, Franco published a manifesto<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a  title="">[8]</a></sup> and left for Africa, where he arrived the next day to take command.</p>
<p>A week later, the rebels, who soon called themselves the <i><a  class="new" title="Nacionales">Nacionales</a></i> (literally Nationals, but almost always referred to in English as Nationalists), controlled only a third of Spain, and most <a href="/wiki/Navy.html" title="Navy">navy</a> units remained under control of the opposition Republican forces, which left Franco isolated. The coup had failed, but the <a href="/wiki/Spanish_Civil_War.html" title="Spanish Civil War">Spanish Civil War</a> had begun.</p>

<h3>The first months</h3>
<p>Despite Franco having no money while the state treasure was in Madrid with the government, there was an organized economic lobby in London looking after his financial needs with Lisbon as their operational base. <sup title="The text in the vicinity of this tag needs citation." class="noprint">[<a  title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><i>citation&#160;needed</i></a>]</sup> At the end he was to receive an enormous help from very important economic persons who acted as well as his diplomatic boosters. The first days of the rebellion were marked with a serious need to secure control over the <a href="/wiki/Protectorate.html" title="Protectorate">Protectorate</a>. On one side, Franco managed to win the support of the natives and their (nominal) authorities, and, on the other, to ensure his control over the army. This led to the execution of some senior officers loyal to the Republic (one of them his own first cousin).<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a  title="">[9]</a></sup> Franco had to face the problem of how to move his troops to the <a href="/wiki/Iberian_Peninsula.html" title="Iberian Peninsula">Iberian Peninsula</a>, because most units of the Navy had remained in control of the Republic and were blocking the <a href="/wiki/Strait_of_Gibraltar.html" title="Strait of Gibraltar">Strait of Gibraltar</a>. His request to Mussolini for help was responded to with an unconditional offer of arms and planes whereas <a href="/wiki/Wilhelm_Canaris.html" title="Wilhelm Canaris">Wilhelm Canaris</a> in Germany did persuade Hitler to follow as well. From <a href="/wiki/July_20.html" title="July 20">July 20</a> onward he was able, with a small group of 22 mainly German <a href="/wiki/Junkers_Ju_52.html" title="Junkers Ju 52">Junkers Ju 52</a> airplanes, to initiate an air bridge to <a href="/wiki/Seville.html" title="Seville">Seville</a>, where his troops helped to ensure the rebel control of the city. Through representatives, he started to negotiate with the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom.html" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>, <a href="/wiki/Germany.html" title="Germany">Germany</a> and <a href="/wiki/Italy.html" title="Italy">Italy</a> for more military support, and above all for more aeroplanes. Negotiations were successful with the last two on <a href="/wiki/July_25.html" title="July 25">July 25</a>, and aeroplanes began to arrive in <a href="/wiki/Tetouan.html" title="Tetouan">Tetouan</a> on <a href="/wiki/August_2.html" title="August 2">August 2</a>. On <a href="/wiki/August_5.html" title="August 5">August 5</a>, Franco was able to break the blockade with the newly arrived air support, successfully deploying a ship convoy with some 2,000 soldiers.</p>
<p>In early August, the situation in western <a href="/wiki/Andalusia.html" title="Andalusia">Andalusia</a> was stable enough to allow him to organize a column (some 15,000 men at its height), under the command of then Lieutenant-Colonel <a href="/wiki/Juan_Yag%C3%BCe.html" title="Juan Yagüe">Juan Yagüe</a>, which would march through <a href="/wiki/Extremadura.html" title="Extremadura">Extremadura</a> towards <a href="/wiki/Madrid.html" title="Madrid">Madrid</a>. <a href="/wiki/August_11.html" title="August 11">August 11</a>, <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_M%C3%A9rida.html" title="Battle of Mérida">Mérida</a> was taken, and <a href="/wiki/August_15.html" title="August 15">August 15</a> <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Badajoz_%281936%29.html" title="Battle of Badajoz (1936)">Badajoz</a>, thus joining both nationalist-controlled areas. Additionally Mussolini has ordered a voluntary army (CTV) of some 12,000 Italians of fully motorised units to arrive to Seville and Hitler added to them a professional squadron from Luftwaffe (2JG/88) with about 24 planes. All these planes had painted the francist insignia on them but were flown by purely Italian and German troops. The basic types of planes that became the backbone of Franco's aviation on those days were the Italian <a href="/wiki/SM79.html" title="SM79">SM79</a> and <a href="/wiki/SM.81.html" title="SM.81">SM.81</a> bombers, the excellent biplane Fiat <a href="/wiki/CR.32.html" title="CR.32">CR.32</a> fighter and the German <a href="/wiki/Junkers_Ju_52.html" title="Junkers Ju 52">Junkers Ju 52</a> cargo-bomber and the rather mediocre <a href="/wiki/Heinkel_He_51.html" title="Heinkel He 51">Heinkel He 51</a> biplane fighter</p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/September_21.html" title="September 21">September 21</a>, with the head of the column at the town of <a href="/wiki/Maqueda.html" title="Maqueda">Maqueda</a> (some 80 km away from Madrid), Franco ordered a detour to free the besieged garrison at the <a href="/wiki/Alc%C3%A1zar.html" title="Alcázar">Alcázar</a> of <a href="/wiki/Toledo_%28Spain%29.html" title="Toledo (Spain)">Toledo</a>, which was achieved <a href="/wiki/September_27.html" title="September 27">September 27</a>. This decision was controversial for it gave the Popular Front time to strengthen its defences in Madrid and hold the city that year, but resulted in an important success for morale and ,as well, for propaganda.</p>

<h3>Rise to power</h3>
<p>The designated leader of the uprising, Gen. <a href="/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Sanjurjo.html" title="José Sanjurjo">José Sanjurjo</a> had died on <a href="/wiki/July_20.html" title="July 20">July 20</a> in an air crash. The nationalist leaders managed to overcome this through regional commands: (<a href="/wiki/Emilio_Mola.html" title="Emilio Mola">Mola</a> in the North, <a href="/wiki/Gonzalo_Queipo_de_Llano.html" title="Gonzalo Queipo de Llano">Queipo</a> in <a href="/wiki/Andalusia.html" title="Andalusia">Andalusia</a>, Franco with an independent command and <a href="/wiki/Miguel_Cabanellas.html" title="Miguel Cabanellas">Cabanellas</a> in <a href="/wiki/Aragon.html" title="Aragon">Aragon</a>), and a coordinating <a href="/wiki/Junta.html" title="Junta">junta</a> nominally led by the last, as the most senior general. On <a href="/wiki/September_21.html" title="September 21">September 21</a>, it was decided that Franco was to be commander-in-chief, and <a href="/wiki/September_28.html" title="September 28">September 28</a>, after some discussion, also head of government. It is speculated that the decision belonged to Hitler. <a href="/wiki/Emilio_Mola.html" title="Emilio Mola">Mola</a> considered Franco as unfit and not part of the initial revolutionary group. Hitler, however, had delivered until then his own help only to Franco who has signed for it and wanted as leader the one who had the written obligation to recognize it as Hitler expected recompensation mainly from the steel producing Basque areas. <a href="/wiki/Mola.html" title="Mola">Mola</a> had to give in because he was very aware that without the support of the two dictators the uprising was doomed to fail. On <a href="/wiki/October_1.html" title="October 1">October 1</a>, <a href="/wiki/1936.html" title="1936">1936</a>, Franco was publicly proclaimed as <i>Generalísimo</i> of the National army and <i>Jefe del Estado</i> (<a href="/wiki/Head_of_State.html" title="Head of State">Head of State</a>). <a href="/wiki/Mola.html" title="Mola">Mola</a> was furious and <a href="/wiki/Miguel_Cabanellas.html" title="Miguel Cabanellas">Cabanellas</a> intervened to calm the spirits down. When <a href="/wiki/Mola.html" title="Mola">Mola</a> was killed in another air accident a year later, no military leader was left from those who organized the conspiracy against the Republic between 1933-35. It is still disputed if Mola's death was a deliberate assassination by the Germans. Mola was rather inclined to the Italians and feared the German intervention in Spain. Mola's death as well as the earlier death in the republican prison of the fascist political party leader <a href="/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Antonio_Primo_de_Rivera.html" title="José Antonio Primo de Rivera">José Antonio Primo de Rivera</a> allowed Franco to pose as a political figure too, despite having no connection with any political movement (book&#160;: <i>La Guerre d'Espagne</i>, author Hugh Tomas, Paris 1977 - french language).</p>

<h3>Military command</h3>
<p>From that time until the end of the war, Franco personally guided military operations. After the <a href="/wiki/Siege_of_Madrid.html" title="Siege of Madrid">failed assault on Madrid</a> in November 1936, Franco settled to a piecemeal approach to winning the war, rather than bold maneuvering. As with his decision to relieve the garrison at Toledo, this approach has been subject of some debate; some of his decisions, such as, in June 1938, when he preferred to head for <a href="/wiki/Valencia.html" title="Valencia">Valencia</a> instead of <a href="/wiki/Catalonia.html" title="Catalonia">Catalonia</a>, remain particularly controversial.</p>
<p>Unable to receive support from any other nation, his army was supported by <a href="/wiki/Nazi_Germany.html" title="Nazi Germany">Nazi Germany</a> in the form of the <a href="/wiki/Condor_Legion.html" title="Condor Legion">Condor Legion</a>, ironically Franco only asked for weapons and tanks and never for the air services of the <a href="/wiki/Condor_Legion.html" title="Condor Legion">Condor Legion</a> <sup title="The text in the vicinity of this tag needs citation." class="noprint">[<a  title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><i>citation&#160;needed</i></a>]</sup>. Yet , these German forces also provided maintenance personnel and trainers, and some 22,000 Germans and 91,000 Italians served over the entire war period in Spain. Principle assistance was received from <a href="/wiki/Fascist.html" title="Fascist">Fascist</a> <a href="/wiki/Italy.html" title="Italy">Italy</a> (<i><a href="/wiki/Corpo_Truppe_Volontarie.html" title="Corpo Truppe Volontarie">Corpo Truppe Volontarie</a></i>), but the degree of influence of both powers on Franco's direction of war seems to have been very limited. Nevertheless, the Italian troops, despite not been always effective were very present in most of the large operations in big numbers while the CTV aviation dominated the skies for most of the war period. Franco was receiving many and frequent supplies from both dictators while the Republicans had tremendous difficulties to buy anything modern and even Russia stopped their supplies after a certain period. <sup title="The text in the vicinity of this tag needs citation." class="noprint">[<a  title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><i>citation&#160;needed</i></a>]</sup></p>
<p>It is said that Franco's direction of the Nazi and Fascist forces was limited, particularly in the direction of the <a href="/wiki/Condor_Legion.html" title="Condor Legion">Condor Legion</a>, however, he was officially , by default, their superior commander and rarely they could decide on their own. <a href="/wiki/Ant%C3%B3nio_de_Oliveira_Salazar.html" title="António de Oliveira Salazar">António de Oliveira Salazar</a>'s <a href="/wiki/Portugal.html" title="Portugal">Portugal</a> also openly assisted the Nationalists from the start. The support of Mussolini and Hitler continued until the very end of the Civil War and Italian and German troops paraded on the day of the final victory in Madrid. It is known, however, that at the backstage of things, both Mussolini and Hitler considered him as a poor military figure as he had promised to take the capital in only three months but it took him three years. There even came a moment where they wanted to quit him but due to prestige reasons that would otherwise backfire on the diplomatic arena against the two dictators, it was decided to continue assisting him till the end (book&#160;: <i>The Spanish Republic and the civil war 1931-39</i>, by Gabriel Jackson, New Jersey, 1967).</p>

<h3>Political command</h3>
<p>He managed to fuse the <a href="/wiki/Ideologically.html" title="Ideologically">ideologically</a> incompatible national-syndicalist <a href="/wiki/Falange.html" title="Falange">Falange</a> ("<a href="/wiki/Phalanx.html" title="Phalanx">phalanx</a>", a <a href="/wiki/Far-right.html" title="Far-right">far-right</a> Spanish <a href="/wiki/Political_party.html" title="Political party">political party</a>) and the <a href="/wiki/Carlism.html" title="Carlism">Carlist</a> monarchist parties under his rule. This new political formation appeased the more extreme and germanophile Falangists while tempering them with the anti-German, pro-Spain Carlists. Franco's brother-in-law Sunez, who was his main political advisor, was able to turn the various parties under Franco aqainst each other to absorb a series of political confrontations against Franco himself. At a certain moment he even expelled the original leading members of both the Carlists and the Falangists to secure Franco's political future.</p>
<p>From early 1937, every death sentence had to be signed (or acknowledged) by Franco. However, this does not mean that he had intimate or complete knowledge of every official execution. From the beginning of the revolt, all the Junta generals were more than keen in publicly executing many people in order to spread fear and reduce resistance. Franco himself said, "I am ready to execute half Spain to do away with the reds…" <span title="The text in the vicinity of this tag needs citation." class="noprint" style="font-size:smaller;"><sup>[<a  title="Wikipedia:Citing sources">cite this quote</a>]</sup></span> After Franco's victory the executions continued with another 200,000 estimated victims on his personal decision and selection.<sup title="The text in the vicinity of this tag needs citation." class="noprint">[<a  title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><i>citation&#160;needed</i></a>]</sup> Recent searches with parallel excavations of mass graves in Spain estimate that the total of people executed after the war may even arrive to a number between 350,000 to 500,000.<sup title="The text in the vicinity of this tag needs citation." class="noprint">[<a  title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><i>citation&#160;needed</i></a>]</sup></p>
<p>It is interesting to note, while it seems that Franco was allowing Germany free reign in Spain, Franco was continually working to prevent the advance of German forces into Spain. During World War II, Admiral <a href="/wiki/Wilhelm_Canaris.html" title="Wilhelm Canaris">Wilhelm Canaris</a> had regular meetings with France and informed Franco of Germany's attitude and plans for Spain. This information prompted Franco to surreptitiously reposition his best and most experienced troops to camps near the Pyrenees and to reshape the terrain to be unfriendly to tanks and other military vehicles.</p>
<p>In the face of German pressure, Spain was also responsible for the safe passage of 45,000-60,000+ Jews. This was accomplished by allowing any Jews who made it to the Spanish border entrance into Spain. Furthermore, any Jew who made it to a Spanish Embassy was granted Spanish citizenship on the basis of being a <a href="/wiki/Sephardic_Jew.html" title="Sephardic Jew">Sephardic Jew</a>, even if there was no evidences of Sephardism.<sup title="The text in the vicinity of this tag needs citation." class="noprint">[<a  title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><i>citation&#160;needed</i></a>]</sup> When Franco was warned that Hitler would not be pleased with this policy and that he would have to face Hitler about this, Franco responded that he would rather face Hitler for aiding the Jews than to face God for not aiding them.</p>

<p>On <a href="/wiki/March_4.html" title="March 4">March 4</a>, <a href="/wiki/1939.html" title="1939">1939</a>, an uprising broke out within the Republican camp, claiming to forestall an intended Communist coup by prime minister Juan Negrín.

They tried to negotiate a settlement with Franco, who refused anything but <a href="/wiki/Unconditional_surrender.html" title="Unconditional surrender">unconditional surrender</a>.

<p>Spain was bitterly divided and economically ruined as a result of the civil war. After the war, a very harsh repression began, with thousands of summary executions, an unknown number of political prisoners and tens of thousands of people in exile, largely in France and Latin America. The 1940 shooting of the president of the <a href="/wiki/Generalitat_de_Catalunya.html" title="Generalitat de Catalunya">Catalan government</a>, <a href="/wiki/Llu%C3%ADs_Companys.html" title="Lluís Companys">Lluís Companys</a>, was one of the most notable cases of this early repression, while the major groups targeted were real and suspected <a href="/wiki/Leftists.html" title="Leftists">leftists</a>, ranging from the moderate, democratic left to <a href="/wiki/Communists.html" title="Communists">Communists</a> and <a href="/wiki/Anarchists.html" title="Anarchists">Anarchists</a>, the Spanish <a href="/wiki/Intelligentsia.html" title="Intelligentsia">intelligentsia</a>, <a href="/wiki/Atheist.html" title="Atheist">atheists</a> and military and government figures who had remained loyal to the Madrid government during the war. The bloodshed in Spain did not end with the cessation of hostilities; many political prisoners suffered execution by the firing squad, under the accusation of treason by martial courts.</p>

<p>In September 1939, <a href="/wiki/World_War_II.html" title="World War II">World War II</a> broke out in Europe, and although <a href="/wiki/Adolf_Hitler.html" title="Adolf Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> met Franco once in <a href="/wiki/Hendaye.html" title="Hendaye">Hendaye</a>, France (<a href="/wiki/October_23.html" title="October 23">October 23</a>, <a href="/wiki/1940.html" title="1940">1940</a>), to discuss Spanish entry on the side of the <a href="/wiki/Axis_Powers.html" title="Axis Powers">Axis</a>, Franco's demands (food, military equipment, <a href="/wiki/Gibraltar.html" title="Gibraltar">Gibraltar</a>, <a href="/wiki/French_North_Africa.html" title="French North Africa">French North Africa</a>, etc.) proved too much and no agreement was reached. Contributing to the disagreement was an ongoing dispute over German mining rights in Spain. Some historians argue that Franco made demands that he knew Hitler would not accede to in order to stay out of the war. Other historians argue that he, as leader of a destroyed country in chaos, simply had nothing to offer the Germans and their military. Yet, after the collapse of France in June 1940, Spain did adopt a pro-Axis non-belligerency stance (for example, he offered Spanish naval facilities to German ships) until returning to complete neutrality in 1943 when the tide of the war had turned decisively against <a href="/wiki/Axis_Powers.html" title="Axis Powers">Germany and its allies</a>. Some volunteer Spanish troops (the <i><a href="/wiki/Blue_Division.html" title="Blue Division">División Azul</a></i>, or "Blue Division")—not given official state sanction by Franco—went to fight on the <a href="/wiki/Eastern_Front_%28WWII%29.html" title="Eastern Front (WWII)">Eastern Front</a> under German command. On <a href="/wiki/June_14.html" title="June 14">June 14</a>, 1940, the Spanish forces in Morocco occupied <a href="/wiki/Tangiers.html" title="Tangiers">Tangiers</a> (a city under the rule of the <a href="/wiki/League_of_Nations.html" title="League of Nations">League of Nations</a>) and did not leave it until 1942. According to a recent book <i>Hitler's Chief Spy (author Richard Basset, 2005)</i>, it is mentioned that his neutrality was paid dearly with a sum by Churchill to a Swiss account. Franco has thus <i>forgotten</i> for a long time after WW2 any claims on Gibraltar</p>
<p>During the war, Franco's Spain also proved to be an escape route for several thousands of, mainly <a href="/wiki/Western_Europe.html" title="Western Europe">Western European</a> Jews fleeing deportation to concentration camps from occupied France. Spanish diplomats extended their protection to <a href="/wiki/Sephardi_Jew.html" title="Sephardi Jew">Sephardi Jews</a> from Eastern Europe too, especially in <a href="/wiki/Hungary.html" title="Hungary">Hungary</a>. As such, Franco's Spain proved to be a safe haven for Jews and a country effectively undertaking more to help Jews escape deportation to the concentration camps than many neutral (Switzerland, Turkey) and Allied countries did.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a  title="">[10]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a  title="">[11]</a></sup></p>

<h3>Post-War</h3>
<p>With the end of World War II, Franco and Spain were forced to suffer the economic consequences of the isolation imposed on it by nations such as the United Kingdom and the United States. This situation ended in part when, due to Spain's strategic location in light of <a href="/wiki/Cold_War.html" title="Cold War">Cold War</a> tensions, the <a href="/wiki/United_States.html" title="United States">United States</a> entered into a trade and military alliance with Spain. This historic alliance commenced with <a href="/wiki/United_States_President.html" title="United States President">United States President</a> <a href="/wiki/Dwight_D._Eisenhower.html" title="Dwight D. Eisenhower">Eisenhower</a>'s visit in 1953 which resulted in the <a href="/wiki/Pact_of_Madrid.html" title="Pact of Madrid">Pact of Madrid</a>. This launched the so-called "<a href="/wiki/Spanish_Miracle.html" title="Spanish Miracle">Spanish Miracle</a>," which developed Spain from <a href="/wiki/Corporatism.html" title="Corporatism">corporatist</a> <a href="/wiki/Autarky.html" title="Autarky">autarky</a> into semi-<a href="/wiki/Capitalism.html" title="Capitalism">capitalism</a>. During the 1960s, Francist Spain's population would experience an enormous increase in personal wealth. Spain was admitted to the <a href="/wiki/United_Nations.html" title="United Nations">United Nations</a> in 1955. In spite of this, once in power, Franco almost never left Spain.</p>
<p>Lacking any strong ideology, Franco initially sought support from <a href="/wiki/National_syndicalism.html" title="National syndicalism">National syndicalism</a> (<i>nacionalsindicalismo</i>) and the <a href="/wiki/Roman_Catholic_Church.html" title="Roman Catholic Church">Roman Catholic Church</a> (<i>nacionalcatolicismo</i>). His coalition-ruling single party, the <a href="/wiki/Movimiento_Nacional.html" title="Movimiento Nacional">Movimiento Nacional</a>, was so heterogeneous as to barely qualify as a party at all, and was certainly not an ideological monolith like the Fascio di Combattimento (<a href="/wiki/Fasci_Italiani_di_Combattimento.html" title="Fasci Italiani di Combattimento">Fascist Party of Italy</a>) or the <a href="/wiki/Estado_Novo_%28Portugal%29.html" title="Estado Novo (Portugal)">ruling block</a> of <a href="/wiki/Antonio_Salazar.html" title="Antonio Salazar">Antonio Salazar</a> in <a href="/wiki/Portugal.html" title="Portugal">Portugal</a>. His Spanish State was chiefly a conservative—even traditionalist—rightist regime, with emphasis on order and stability, rather than a definite political vision.</p>
<p>In 1947, Franco proclaimed Spain a <a href="/wiki/Monarchy.html" title="Monarchy">monarchy</a>, but did not designate a monarch. This gesture was largely done to appease monarchist factions within the <a  class="new" title="Movimiento">Movimiento</a>. Although a self-proclaimed monarchist himself, Franco had no particular desire for a king, and as such, he left the throne vacant, with himself as <i>de facto</i> <a href="/wiki/Regent.html" title="Regent">regent</a>. He wore the uniform of a <a href="/wiki/Captain_General.html" title="Captain General">Captain General</a> (a rank traditionally reserved for the King) and resided in the <a href="/wiki/El_Pardo.html" title="El Pardo">El Pardo Palace</a> (not to be confused with the <a href="/wiki/Museo_del_Prado.html" title="Museo del Prado">El Prado</a>). In addition, he appropriated the kingly privilege of walking beneath a <a href="/wiki/Baldachin.html" title="Baldachin">canopy</a>, and his portrait appeared on most Spanish coins. Indeed, although his formal titles were <i>Jefe del Estado</i> (Chief of State), and <i>Generalísimo de los Ejércitos Españoles</i> (<i>Generalísimo</i> of the Spanish Armed Forces), he had originally intended any government that succeeded him to be much more authoritarian than the previous monarchy. This is indicated in his use of "<a href="/wiki/By_the_grace_of_God.html" title="By the grace of God">by the grace of God</a>" in his official title. It is a technical, legal phrase which indicates sovereign dignity in <a href="/wiki/Absolute_monarchy.html" title="Absolute monarchy">absolute monarchies</a>, and is only used by monarchs.</p>
<p>During his rule, non-government <a href="/wiki/Trade_union.html" title="Trade union">trade unions</a> and all political opponents across the <a href="/wiki/Political_spectrum.html" title="Political spectrum">political spectrum</a>, from <a href="/wiki/Communism.html" title="Communism">communist</a> and <a href="/wiki/Anarchism.html" title="Anarchism">anarchist</a> organizations to <a href="/wiki/Liberal_democracy.html" title="Liberal democracy">liberal democrats</a> and <a href="/wiki/Catalan_nationalism.html" title="Catalan nationalism">Catalan</a> or <a href="/wiki/Basque_nationalism.html" title="Basque nationalism">Basque</a> nationalists, were suppressed. The only legal "trade union" was the government-run <a href="/wiki/Sindicato_Vertical.html" title="Sindicato Vertical">Sindicato Vertical</a>.</p>
<p>In order to build a uniform Spanish nation, the public usage of languages other than <a href="/wiki/Spanish_language.html" title="Spanish language">Spanish</a> (especially <a href="/wiki/Catalan_language.html" title="Catalan language">Catalan</a>, <a href="/wiki/Galician_language.html" title="Galician language">Galician</a> and <a href="/wiki/Basque_language.html" title="Basque language">Basque languages</a>) was strongly repressed. <a href="/wiki/Language_politics_in_Francoist_Spain.html" title="Language politics in Francoist Spain">Language politics in Francoist Spain</a> stated that all government, notarial, legal and commercial documents were drawn up exclusively in Spanish and any written in other languages were deemed null and void. The usage of other than Spanish languages was banned on road and shop signs, advertising and, in general, all exterior images of the country.</p>
