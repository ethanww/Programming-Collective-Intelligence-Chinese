<p><a name="Origin_of_the_name" id="Origin_of_the_name"></a></p>
<h2>Origin of the name</h2>
<p>The name <i>Shakers</i>, and the variant, <b>Shaking Quakers</b>, originally pejorative, was applied as a mocking description of their <a href="/wiki/Ritual.html" title="Ritual">rituals</a> of trembling, shouting, dancing, shaking, singing, and <a href="/wiki/Glossolalia.html" title="Glossolalia">glossolalia</a> (speaking in strange and unknown languages). Its origin is probably similar to that of the term <i><a href="/wiki/Religious_Society_of_Friends.html" title="Religious Society of Friends">Quaker</a></i>. The first documented use of the term comes from a British newspaper reporter who wrote in 1758 that the worshippers rolled on the floor and spoke in tongues.</p>

<p><a name="Wardley_predecessors" id="Wardley_predecessors"></a></p>
<h2>Wardley predecessors</h2>
<p>Derived from a small branch of English Quakers who had adopted some of the <a href="/wiki/Doctrine.html" title="Doctrine">doctrines</a> of <a href="/wiki/Worship.html" title="Worship">worship</a> followed by the 'French Prophets,' as Londoners called the <a href="/wiki/Camisards.html" title="Camisards">Camisards</a>, who had been driven into English exile from the provinces of <a href="/wiki/Vivarais.html" title="Vivarais">Vivarais</a> and <a href="/wiki/Dauphin%C3%A9.html" title="Dauphiné">Dauphiné</a>. Under the leadership of <a  class="new" title="James Wardley">James</a> and <a  class="new" title="Jane Wardley">Jane Wardley</a>, husband and wife, the group became known for their intense, ecstatic worship. The Wardleys' followers, when "wrestling in soul to be freed from the power of sin and a worldly life," writhed and trembled, purportedly under the influence of the <a href="/wiki/Holy_Spirit.html" title="Holy Spirit">Holy Spirit</a>, so that they won the name Shakers; their trances and visions, their jumping and dancing, were like those of many other sects, such as the Low Countries dancers of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, the French <i>Convulsionnaires</i> of 1720–1770, or the Welsh Methodist Jumpers.</p>
<p>The original and proper name of the group is the <b>United Society of Believers in Christ’s Second Appearing</b>, but followers quickly adopted the derogatory nickname, Shaking Quakers, which had been given to them by their many detractors.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Ann Lee">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Ann_Lee" id="Ann_Lee"></a></p>
<h2>Ann Lee</h2>
<p>Under the leadership of Mother <a href="/wiki/Ann_Lee.html" title="Ann Lee">Ann Lee</a>, beginning in 1774, the <a href="/wiki/Work_ethic.html" title="Work ethic">work ethic</a> and rejection of marriage for which they have ever since been known began to typify the movement. She joined the Wardleys in 1758.</p>
<p>Although a believer in <a href="/wiki/Celibacy.html" title="Celibacy">celibacy</a>, she had, at her <a href="/wiki/Parent.html" title="Parent">parents</a>' urging, married Abraham Stanley (Standley, or Standerin), and bore him four <a href="/wiki/Children.html" title="Children">children</a>, all of whom died in infancy. She was miserable in marriage, and by 1770 had begun to insist that the institution was not compatible with the <a href="/wiki/Kingdom_of_God.html" title="Kingdom of God">Kingdom of God</a>. Like many others in the Quaker tradition, she believed in and taught her followers that it is possible to attain perfect <a href="/wiki/Holiness.html" title="Holiness">holiness</a>. Like her predecessors the Wardleys, she taught that the demonstrations of shaking and trembling were caused by sin being purged from the body by the power of the Holy Spirit, purifying the worshiper. Distinctively, the followers of Mother Ann came to believe that she embodied all the perfections of God in female form.</p>
<p>She rose to prominence in the movement through her dramatic urging of the Believers to preach more publicly concerning the Kingdom of God, and to attack <a href="/wiki/Sin.html" title="Sin">sin</a> more boldly and unconventionally. She was frequently imprisoned for breaking the <a href="/wiki/Sabbath.html" title="Sabbath">Sabbath</a> by dancing and shouting, and for <a href="/wiki/Blasphemy.html" title="Blasphemy">blasphemy</a>. While in prison in Manchester for 14 days, she said she had a <a href="/wiki/Revelation.html" title="Revelation">revelation</a> that "a complete cross against the lusts of generation, added to a full and explicit confession, before witnesses, of all the <a href="/wiki/Sin.html" title="Sin">sins</a> committed under its influence, was the only possible remedy and means of <a href="/wiki/Salvation.html" title="Salvation">salvation</a>".</p>
<p>After this, she was chosen by the society as "Mother in spiritual things" and called herself "Ann, the Word" and also "Mother Ann". Another revelation bade her take a select band to America. Mother Ann arrived on <a href="/wiki/August_6.html" title="August 6">August 6</a>, <a href="/wiki/1774.html" title="1774">1774</a> in <a href="/wiki/New_York_City.html" title="New York City">New York City</a>, and in 1776 the Shakers settled in the township of <a href="/wiki/Watervliet%2C_New_York.html" title="Watervliet, New York">Watervliet</a>, near <a href="/wiki/Albany%2C_New_York.html" title="Albany, New York">Albany</a>, where a unique <a href="/wiki/Community.html" title="Community">community</a> life began to develop and thrive.</p>

<p>The <a href="/wiki/Village.html" title="Village">village</a> was divided into groups or "families" that were named for points on the <a href="/wiki/Compass_rose.html" title="Compass rose">compass rose</a>. Each house was divided so that men and women did everything separately. They used different staircases, doors and even sat on opposite sides of the room. The men and women were segregated to prevent them from touching one another during the <a href="/wiki/Epilepsy.html" title="Epilepsy">epileptic-like</a> fits that they fell into during worship.

<p>A <a href="/wiki/Spiritualism.html" title="Spiritualism">spiritualistic</a> revival in the neighboring town of <a href="/wiki/New_Lebanon%2C_New_York.html" title="New Lebanon, New York">New Lebanon</a> sent many penitents to Watervliet, who accepted Mother Ann's teachings and organized in 1787 (before any formal organization in Watervliet) the New Lebanon Society, the first Shaker Society, at New Lebanon (since 1861 called Mt. Lebanon), Columbia county, New York. The Society at Watervliet, organized immediately afterwards, and the New Lebanon Society formed a bishopric. The Watervliet members, as <a href="/wiki/Pacifism.html" title="Pacifism">pacifists</a> and non-jurors, had got into trouble during the <a href="/wiki/American_War_of_Independence.html" title="American War of Independence">American War of Independence</a>; in 1780 the Board of Elders were imprisoned, but all except Mother Ann were speedily set free, and she was released in 1781.</p>

<h2>Communalism under Joseph Meacham</h2>
<p>Between 1781 and 1783 the Mother, with chosen elders, visited her followers in New York, Massachusetts and Connecticut. She died in <a href="/wiki/Watervliet%2C_New_York.html" title="Watervliet, New York">Watervliet, New York</a> on <a href="/wiki/September_8.html" title="September 8">September 8</a>, <a href="/wiki/1784.html" title="1784">1784</a>. James Whittaker was head of the Believers for three years. On his death he was succeeded by Joseph Meacham (1742–1796), who had been a Baptist minister in <a href="/wiki/Enfield%2C_Connecticut.html" title="Enfield, Connecticut">Enfield, Connecticut</a>, and had, second only to Mother Ann, the spiritual gift of revelation. Under his rule and that of <a  class="new" title="Lucy Wright">Lucy Wright</a> (1760–1821), who shared the headship with him during his lifetime and then for twenty-five years ruled alone, the organization of the Shakers and, particularly, a rigid <a href="/wiki/Communalism.html" title="Communalism">communalism</a> (<a href="/wiki/Religious_communism.html" title="Religious communism">religious communism</a>), began. By 1793 property had been made a "consecrated whole" in the different communities, but a "noncommunal order" also had been established, in which sympathizers with the principles of the Believers lived in <a href="/wiki/Family.html" title="Family">families</a>. The Shakers never forbade <a href="/wiki/Marriage.html" title="Marriage">marriage</a>, but refused to recognize it as a <a href="/wiki/Christianity.html" title="Christianity">Christian</a> institution since the second coming in the person of Mother Ann, and considered it less perfect than the <a href="/wiki/Celibacy.html" title="Celibacy">celibate</a> state. Shaker communities in this period were established in 1790 at Hancock, West <a href="/wiki/Pittsfield%2C_Massachusetts.html" title="Pittsfield, Massachusetts">Pittsfield, Massachusetts</a>; in 1791 at <a href="/wiki/Harvard%2C_Massachusetts.html" title="Harvard, Massachusetts">Harvard, Massachusetts</a>; in 1792 at East <a href="/wiki/Canterbury%2C_New_Hampshire.html" title="Canterbury, New Hampshire">Canterbury, New Hampshire</a> (or Shaker Village); and in 1793 at <a href="/wiki/Shirley%2C_Massachusetts.html" title="Shirley, Massachusetts">Shirley, Massachusetts</a>; at <a href="/wiki/Enfield%2C_Connecticut.html" title="Enfield, Connecticut">Enfield, Connecticut</a> (then also known as Shaker Station); at <a href="/wiki/Enfield%2C_New_Hampshire.html" title="Enfield, New Hampshire">Enfield, New Hampshire</a> (or "Chosen Vale"); at <a href="/wiki/Tyringham%2C_Massachusetts.html" title="Tyringham, Massachusetts">Tyringham, Massachusetts</a>, where the Society was afterwards abandoned, its members joining the communities in Hancock and Enfield; at <a href="/wiki/New_Gloucester%2C_Maine.html" title="New Gloucester, Maine">New Gloucester, Maine</a> (since 1890: "Sabbathday Lake"); and at <a href="/wiki/Alfred%2C_Maine.html" title="Alfred, Maine">Alfred, Maine</a>, where, more than anywhere else among the Shakers, spiritualistic healing of the sick was practiced.

<h3>Expansion and contraction</h3>
<p>A prominent part in this revival had been taken by Richard McNemar, a Presbyterian, who had broken with his Church because of his <a href="/wiki/Arminianism.html" title="Arminianism">Arminian</a> tendencies and had established the quasi-independent Turtle Creek Church. McNemar was won by Shaker missionaries in 1805, and many of his parishioners joined him to form the Union Village community in <a href="/wiki/Turtlecreek_Township%2C_Warren_County%2C_Ohio.html" title="Turtlecreek Township, Warren County, Ohio">Turtlecreek Township, Warren County, Ohio</a>, four miles west of <a href="/wiki/Lebanon%2C_Ohio.html" title="Lebanon, Ohio">Lebanon</a>. McNemar was a favorite of Lucy Wright, who gave him the spiritual name Eleazer Riotht, which he changed to Eleazer Wright; he wrote The <i>Kentucky Revival</i> (Cincinnati, 1807), probably the earliest defense of Shakerism, and a poem, entitled <i>A Concise Answer to the General Inquiry Who or What are the Shakers</i> (1808).</p>
<p>In 1811 a community settled at Busro on the Wabash in <a href="/wiki/Indiana.html" title="Indiana">Indiana</a>; but it was soon abandoned and its members went to Ohio and to Kentucky. In Ohio later communities were formed at Watervliet, Montgomery and Greene counties, and at Whitewater, Butler and Hamilton counties. In <a href="/wiki/New_York.html" title="New York">New York</a>, the communal property at Sodus Bay was sold in 1828 and the community removed to Groveland, or Sonyea; their land here was sold to the state and the few remaining members went to Watervliet. A short-lived community at <a href="/wiki/Canaan%2C_New_York.html" title="Canaan, New York">Canaan</a>, was merged into the communities in Mount Lebanon (in <a href="/wiki/New_Lebanon%2C_New_York.html" title="New Lebanon, New York">New Lebanon</a>) and <a href="/wiki/Enfield%2C_Connecticut.html" title="Enfield, Connecticut">Enfield, Connecticut</a>.</p>
<p>The peak was probably reached between 1830 and 1850 at about 6000 members. The numerical strength of the sect decreased rapidly, probably from 4000 to 1000 from 1887 to 1908, and there has been little effort made to plant new communities. The Mt. Lebanon Society in 1894 established a colony at <a  class="new" title="Narcoossee, Florida">Narcoossee, Florida</a>; the attempt of the Union Village Society in 1898 to plant a settlement at <a href="/wiki/White_Oak%2C_Georgia.html" title="White Oak, Georgia">White Oak, Georgia</a>, was unsuccessful. In 1910 the Union Village Society went into the hands of a receiver.</p>
<p>At various times, the Shakers had eighteen major communities in eight states and six smaller communities in <a href="/wiki/Florida.html" title="Florida">Florida</a> and <a href="/wiki/Indiana.html" title="Indiana">Indiana</a>. The city of <a href="/wiki/Shaker_Heights%2C_Ohio.html" title="Shaker Heights, Ohio">Shaker Heights, Ohio</a>, population 29,000, a suburb of <a href="/wiki/Cleveland.html" title="Cleveland">Cleveland</a>, was originally a Shaker settlement.</p>
<p>Today there are very few remaining Shakers left. They reside in Sabbathday Lake, Maine.</p>

<h2>Communal spiritual family</h2>
<p>The Shakers did not believe in procreation so therefore had to adopt a child if they wanted one. Another way they could expand their community's population was to allow converts into the Shaker society to live and function as one. When Shaker boys reached the age of twenty-one, they were given the choice to leave the Shaker <a href="/wiki/Religion.html" title="Religion">religion</a> and go their own separate way or to continue on as a Shaker. The Shakers lived in "families" sharing a large house with separate entrances for each <a href="/wiki/Family.html" title="Family">family</a> within the "family"; thus the families were exclusively male or female — the <a href="/wiki/Sex.html" title="Sex">sexes</a> were segregated into separate living areas.</p>
<p>The Shakers struggled with complex human problems that have no simple answers, and they managed to set up and sustain a distinctive way of life with much appeal for more than two hundred years.</p>

<p><a name="Revelations_and_visions" id="Revelations_and_visions"></a></p>
<h3>Revelations and visions</h3>
<p>A peculiar, intense kind of spirituality began to develop under this unique arrangement. A period of spiritual manifestations among the Believers began in 1837 and lasted through 1847. Children told of visits to cities in the spirit realm and brought messages to the community which they received from Mother Ann. In 1838 the gift of tongues was manifested and sacred places were set aside in each community, with names like Holy Mount; but in 1847 the spirits, after warning, left the Believers. The theology of the denomination is based on the idea of the dualism of God: the creation of man as male and female "in our image" showing the bi-sexuality of the Creator; in Jesus, born of a woman, the son of a Jewish carpenter, were the <a href="/wiki/Male.html" title="Male">male</a> manifestation of Christ and the first Christian Church; and in Mother Ann, daughter of an English blacksmith, were the female manifestation of Christ and the second Christian Church — she was the Bride ready for the Bridegroom, and in her the promises of the Second Coming were fulfilled. Adam's sin was in sexual impurity; marriage is done away with in the body of the Believers in the Second Appearance, who must pattern after the Kingdom in which there is no marriage or giving in marriage. The four virtues are <a href="/wiki/Virgin.html" title="Virgin">virgin</a> purity; Christian communism; confession of sin, without which none can become Believers; and separation from the world. Their insistence on the bi-sexuality of <a href="/wiki/God.html" title="God">God</a> and their reverence for Mother Ann have made them advocates of sex equality. Their spiritual directors are elders and "eldresses," and their temporal guides are deacons and deaconesses in equal numbers.</p>

<h3>Culture of work</h3>
<p>The prescribed uniform costume with woman's neckerchief and cap, and the custom of men wearing their hair long on the neck and cut in a straight bang on the forehead, still persist; but the women wear different colors. The communism of the Believers was an economic success, and their cleanliness, honesty and frugality received the highest praise. They made leather in New York for several years, but in selling herbs and garden seeds, in making "apple-sauce" (at Shirley), in weaving linen (at Alfred), and in knitting underwear they did better work.</p>

<p>Shakers were known for a style of furniture, known as <a href="/wiki/Shaker_furniture.html" title="Shaker furniture">Shaker furniture</a>. It was plain in style, durable, and functional. Shaker <a href="/wiki/Chair.html" title="Chair">chairs</a> were usually mass-produced since a great number of them were needed to seat all the Shakers in a community. Around the time of the American Civil War, the Shakers at Mount Lebanon, NY, greatly increased their production and marketing of Shaker chairs. They were so successful that several furniture companies produced their own versions of "Shaker" chairs. Because of the quality of their craftsmanship, original Shaker <a href="/wiki/Furniture.html" title="Furniture">furniture</a> is costly. One Shaker chair, actually a tall stool, sold for just under <a href="/wiki/US_dollar.html" title="US dollar">US$</a>100,000</p>
<p>Shakers worshipped in plain meetinghouses where they marched , sang songs, danced, twitched and shouted. Many outsiders who witnessed Shaker worship services considered them <a href="/wiki/Heresy.html" title="Heresy">heretics</a> and protested in front of their places of worship. Mother Ann was arrested several times for disturbing the peace. Early Shaker worship services were unstructured, loud, chaotic and emotional. However, later on, Shakers developed precision dances and orderly rituals. The Shakers have also written thousands of religious songs.</p>
<p>The meetinghouses were painted white and unadorned, with shutters and carvings eschewed as worldly things. The Shakers believed in the value of hard work and kept comfortably busy. Each member learned a craft and did chores. Mother Ann said, "Labor to make the way of God your own; let it be your <a href="/wiki/Inheritance.html" title="Inheritance">inheritance</a>, your <a href="/wiki/Treasure.html" title="Treasure">treasure</a>, your occupation, your daily calling."</p>

<p>Shaker beliefs have generated a unique culture and ways of life that have enriched the cultural history of the <a href="/wiki/United_States.html" title="United States">United States</a> as well as subsequently inspired many modern fields.</p>
<p>One of the major attributes of the Shakers was to build. This combined with their dedication to hard work and perfection has resulted in a unique range of architecture, furniture and handicraft styles. They relied on their own skills and natural resources for all these as well as for providing for their family. Shakers designed their furniture with care, believing that making something well was in itself, "an act of prayer". They never fashioned items with elaborate details or extra decorations, but only made things for their intended uses. The <a  class="new" title="Ladder-back chair">ladder-back chair</a> was a popular piece of furniture. Shaker craftsmen made most things out of <a href="/wiki/Pine.html" title="Pine">pine</a> or other inexpensive <a href="/wiki/Wood.html" title="Wood">woods</a> and hence their furniture was light in color and weight. Shaker interior spaces are characterized by an austerity and simplicity. For example, they had a continuous wooden device like a <a href="/wiki/Pelmet.html" title="Pelmet">pelmet</a> with hooks running all along the <a href="/wiki/Lintel.html" title="Lintel">lintel</a> level from which they hung the very light furniture pieces such as chairs when not in use. The simple, honest <a href="/wiki/Architecture.html" title="Architecture">architecture</a> of their homes, meeting houses, and barns have had a long lasting influence on American architecture and design. They have a collection of furniture and utensils outside of Pittsfield, Mass. famous for its elegance and practicality.</p>

<p>Shaker ways influenced many people to write <a href="/wiki/Book.html" title="Book">books</a> and adopt ways of life from Shakers. By the middle of the twentieth century, as the Shaker communities themselves were disappearing, some American collectors whose visual tastes were formed by the stark aspects of the <a href="/wiki/Modernist.html" title="Modernist">modernist</a> movement found themselves drawn to the spare artifacts of Shaker culture, in which "form follows function" was also clearly expressed. <a href="/wiki/Kaare_Klint.html" title="Kaare Klint">Kaare Klint</a>, an <a href="/wiki/Architect.html" title="Architect">architect</a> and famous furniture designer, used styles from Shaker furniture in his work. Another example is Doris Humphrey, an innovator in technique, <a href="/wiki/Choreography.html" title="Choreography">choreography</a>, and theory of dance movement. She made a full theatrical art with her dance entitled Dance of The Chosen Ones in which the nature of the Shakers’ religious fervor was depicted.</p>

<p><a name="Shaker_music" id="Shaker_music"></a></p>
<h2>Shaker music</h2>
<p>The Shakers considered music to be an essential component of the religious experience, and created some of the most tuneful, idiosyncratic, and utterly singable music in American history. In Shaker society, a spiritual "gift" could also be a musical revelation, and they considered it to be important to record these musical inspirations as they occurred. Scribes, many of whom had no formal musical training, used a form of music notation for this purpose: it used letters of the alphabet, often not positioned on a staff, along with a simple notation of conventional rhythmic values. This method has a curious, and coincidental, similarity to some ancient Greek music notation.</p>
<p>Many of the lyrics to Shaker tunes consist of syllables and words from unknown tongues, the musical equivalent of <a href="/wiki/Glossolalia.html" title="Glossolalia">glossolalia</a>. Many of them were imitated from the sounds of Native American languages, as well as from the songs of African slaves, especially in the southernmost of the Shaker communities.</p>
<p>The most famed of Shaker songs is <i><a href="/wiki/Simple_Gifts.html" title="Simple Gifts">Simple Gifts</a></i>, which <a href="/wiki/Aaron_Copland.html" title="Aaron Copland">Aaron Copland</a> used as a theme for variations in <i><a href="/wiki/Appalachian_Spring.html" title="Appalachian Spring">Appalachian Spring</a>.</i> The tune was composed by Elder Joseph Brackett and originated in the Shaker community at <a href="/wiki/Alfred%2C_Maine.html" title="Alfred, Maine">Alfred, Maine</a> in 1848. Many contemporary Christian denominations incorporate this tune into <a href="/wiki/Hymnal.html" title="Hymnal">hymnals</a>, under various names, including "Lord of the Dance," adapted by English poet and songwriter <a href="/wiki/Sydney_Carter.html" title="Sydney Carter">Sydney Carter</a>.</p>
<p>The Shakers composed thousands of songs, and created also many dances; both were an important part of the Shaker worship services. Some scholars, such as <a  class="new" title="Daniel W. Patterson">Daniel W. Patterson</a> and <a  class="new" title="Roger L. Hall">Roger L. Hall</a>, have compiled books of these songs, and groups have been formed to sing the songs and perform the dances. There are recordings available of Shaker songs, both documentation of singing by the Shakers themselves, as well as songs recorded by other groups (see external links).</p>

<p>Membership in the Shakers dwindled in the late 1800s for several reasons. People were attracted to cities and away from the farms. Shaker products could not compete with mass-produced products that became available at a much lower cost. Shakers could not have children, and although they did adopt up until the states gained control of adoption homes, this was not a major source of new members. Some Shaker settlements, such as <a href="/wiki/Pleasant_Hill%2C_Kentucky.html" title="Pleasant Hill, Kentucky">Pleasant Hill</a> community in Kentucky, have become <a href="/wiki/Museum.html" title="Museum">museums</a>.</p>
<p>Believers have continually looked at the story of Ann Lee as a cornerstone of the theological architecture that has distinguished their church from other American religious groups. Shaker theology, its manifestation in material artifacts such as furniture and oval boxes, and the Ann Lee story have continually drawn the attention of outsiders either fascinated or repulsed by them.</p>
<p>Although there were six thousand believers at the peak of the Shaker movement, there were only twelve Shakers left by 1920. In the United States there were two remaining active Shaker communities, at <a href="/wiki/Sabbathday_Lake%2C_Maine.html" title="Sabbathday Lake, Maine">Sabbathday Lake, Maine</a> and <a href="/wiki/Canterbury%2C_New_Hampshire.html" title="Canterbury, New Hampshire">Canterbury, New Hampshire</a>, the latter of which died with its last member, Ethel Hudson, in September 1992<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a  title="">[2]</a></sup>. The Sabbathday Lake community still accepts new recruits, as it has since its founding. Shakers are no longer allowed to adopt orphan children after new laws were passed in 1960 refusing religious groups to take control of adoption, but adults who wish to embrace Shaker life are welcome. This community, founded in 1783, was one of the smaller and more isolated Shaker communities during the sect's heyday. They farm and practice a variety of handicrafts; a <a  class="external text" title="http://www.shaker.lib.me.us/">Shaker Museum, and Sunday services</a>, are open to visitors. Now Mother Ann day is celebrated on the first Sunday of August. The people sing and dance and a Mother Ann cake is presented. There is a legend that one of Mother Ann's predictions states that there will be a revival when there are only five Shakers left. However, there is no evidence to suggest Mother Ann stated this.</p>
<p>The modern day union of Shakers is known as the United Society of Believers in Christ's Second Coming.</p>
<p>The daily schedule of a Shaker in Sabbathday Lake Village is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>The day will begin for many at 7:30 a.m., the Great Bell on Dwelling House rings calling every one to breakfast.</li>
<li>At 8:00 a.m. Morning Prayers will start. They may read two Psalms and then read from the Bible. This will be followed by Prayer and silent prayer, concluded with the singing of a Shaker hymn.</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Manual_labour.html" title="Manual labour">Work</a> for the Shakers begins at 8:30.</li>
<li>Work is interrupted at 11:30 for Mid-day prayers.</li>
<li><i>Dinner</i> begins at 12:00. This is the main meal for the Shakers.</li>
<li>Work will continue at 1:00 p.m.</li>
<li>At 6:00 it is supper time, the last meal of the day.</li>
<li>On Wednesdays at 5:00 p.m. they hold a prayer meeting which is followed by a Shakers Studies class.</li>

<h2>Shaker Trust</h2>
<p>To preserve their legacy as well as their idyllic, lakeside property at <a href="/wiki/Sabbathday_Lake%2C_Maine.html" title="Sabbathday Lake, Maine">Sabbathday Lake, Maine</a>, the Shakers announced in October 2005 that they had entered into a trust with the state of <a href="/wiki/Maine.html" title="Maine">Maine</a> and several conservation groups. Under the agreement, the Shakers will sell conservation easements to the trust, allowing the village to ward off development and continue operating as long as there are Shakers to live there.</p>
<p>The agreement does not specify whether the property will become a park, museum or other public space should the Shakers die off. That decision would be made by a nonprofit corporation—the United Society of Shakers, Sabbathday Lake Inc.—whose board members are largely non-Shakers. The $3.7 million conservation plan relies on grants, donations and public funds.</p>
