<p><a name="Background" id="Background"></a></p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>C and pascal are often compared* to each other, sometimes heatedly, probably because the languages have similar times of origin, influences, and purposes, and so represent two philosophical approaches to a similar need. Both were used to design (and compile) their own compilers early in their lifetimes, and both were established and popular during the formative years of the <a href="/wiki/Microcomputer.html" title="Microcomputer">microcomputer</a> age.</p>
<p>Both <a href="/wiki/C_programming_language.html" title="C programming language">C</a> and <a href="/wiki/Pascal_programming_language.html" title="Pascal programming language">Pascal</a> are quite old languages. An original <a href="/wiki/Pascal_programming_language.html" title="Pascal programming language">Pascal</a> definition appeared in 1969 and a first compiler in 1970, the first version of <a href="/wiki/C_programming_language.html" title="C programming language">C</a> a few years later, around 1972. Both are arguably descendants of the Algol language series.</p>
<p>Algol introduced so called <i>structured programming</i>, where programs are constructed of single entry / single exit constructs such as <b>if</b>, <b>while</b>, <b>for</b>, <b>case</b>, and so on. Furthermore, only expression syntaxes were (more or less) systematically described before Algol, which defined the entire language syntax in terms of a recursive grammar (BNF). This tended to make the language more general and regular.</p>
<p>Pascal steems directly from AlgolW, while it shared some new ideas with Algol68. The C language is more indirectly related to Algol, originally through B, BCPL, and CPL, and later through Algol68 (struct, union etc) and also Pascal (enumerations, const, typedef, booleans). Important Pascal dialects (and later, standards) also incorporated characteristics from C, see further below.</p>
<p>The modern versions of the languages have become quite similar, especially <a href="/wiki/Data_type.html" title="Data type">types</a> and <a href="/wiki/Data_structure.html" title="Data structure">data structuring</a> possibilities, but also control structures and general layout are (very) roughly equivalent. The most important remaining differences concerns declaration syntax, expression evaluation, nested procedures, and modular programming (separate compilation).</p>
<p><i>* It would be less interesting to compare, say, C with Lisp, or Pascal versus Perl, as these languages are so clearly different and have very different aims.</i></p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Syntax">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Syntax" id="Syntax"></a></p>
<h2>Syntax</h2>
<p>Both C and Pascal use semicolons between statements. In C they terminate every statement, while in Pascal they separate statements. In practice, there is little difference between these schemes.</p>
<p>In C, comments are formed by /* <i>comments</i> */. In Pascal, there are (* <i>comments</i> *) and { <i>comments</i> }.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Identifiers">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Identifiers" id="Identifiers"></a></p>
<h3>Identifiers</h3>
<p>C and Pascal differ in their interpretation of upper and lower case. In Pascal case does not matter, in C it does. Thus <code>MyLabel</code> and <code>mylabel</code> are two different identifiers in C, but the same identifier in Pascal. This may cause problems if object files generated from the two languages are <a href="/wiki/Linker.html" title="Linker">linked</a> together.</p>
<p>In both languages, identifiers consists of letters, digits, and underscores ("_") with the rule that the first character may not be a digit. In C names that begin with "_" are sometimes used to differentiate special system identifiers. Certain Pascal systems use this convention as well.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Keywords">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Keywords" id="Keywords"></a></p>
<h3>Keywords</h3>
<p>Both C and Pascal use <a href="/wiki/Keyword_%28computer_programming%29.html" title="Keyword (computer programming)">keywords</a>, or words reserved for use by the language itself. Examples are <b>if</b>, <b>while</b>, <b>const</b>, <b>for</b> and <b>goto</b>, which are keywords that happens to be common to both languages.</p>
<p>In Pascal, blocks begin and end with <b>begin</b> and <b>end</b>. C uses "{" and "}", respectively. In Pascal, a <a href="/wiki/Function_%28programming%29.html" title="Function (programming)">function</a> definition starts with the keyword <b>function</b> and a <a href="/wiki/Type_%28computer_science%29.html" title="Type (computer science)">type</a> definition with <b>type</b>. In C, function definitions are determined by syntactical context while type definitions use the reserved word <b>typedef</b>.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Implementation">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Implementation" id="Implementation"></a></p>
<h3>Implementation</h3>
<p>The grammars of both languages are of a similar size. From an implementation perspective the main difference between the two language is that to <a href="/wiki/Parse.html" title="Parse">parse</a> C it is necessary to have access to a symbol table, while in Pascal there is no such requirement. For instance, in C, the following:</p>
<pre>
X * Y;
</pre>
<p>could be a declaration of <code>Y</code> to be a pointer to type <code>X</code>, or a statement that multiplies <code>X</code> and <code>Y</code>.</p>

<p><a name="Simple_types" id="Simple_types"></a></p>
<h2>Simple types</h2>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Integers">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Integers" id="Integers"></a></p>
<h3>Integers</h3>
<p>Pascal requires all variable and function declarations to explicitly specify their type. In traditional C, a type name may be omitted in most context and the default type int (which corresponds to <b><a href="/wiki/Integer.html" title="Integer">integer</a></b> in Pascal) is then implicitly assumed. However, this has been removed from the language as of the C99 standard.</p>
<p>C accommodates different sizes and <a href="/wiki/Signedness.html" title="Signedness">signed and unsigned</a> modes for integers by using modifiers such as long, short, signed, unsigned, etc. The exact meaning of the resulting int type is machine-dependent, however, what <i>can</i> be guaranteed is:</p>
<ul>
<li>long int is no shorter than int</li>
<li>int is no shorter than short int</li>
</ul>
<p>Even char is actually a kind of integer that is no longer than short int (an eight-bit byte on most machines),<br />
this integer nature of char is clearly illustrated by declarations such as</p>
<pre>
unsigned char uc = 255;   /* usual limit */
signed char sc = -128;    /* usual negative limit */
</pre>
<p>There has been some controversy as whether the char type should be regarded as signed or unsigned default.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Subranges">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Subranges" id="Subranges"></a></p>
<h3>Subranges</h3>
<p>In Pascal, the same end is performed by declaring a <i>subrange</i> of integer:</p>
<pre>
<b>type</b> a = 1..100;
     b = -20..20;
     c = 0..100000;
</pre>
<p>This subrange feature (simply called a "range") is not supported by C.</p>
<p>A major, if subtle, difference between C and Pascal is how they promote integer operations. In Pascal, all operations on integers or integer subranges must have the same effect as if all of the operands were promoted to a full integer. In C, there are defined rules as to how to promote different types of integers, typically with the effect that the result of two integers will not have a precision greater than either of the operands. This can have the effect of making C more efficient in use of registers or resources on a machine with mixed word lengths. A highly optimizing Pascal compiler can reduce, but not eliminate, the effect of this under standard Pascal rules. A side effect of this Pascal feature is that many Pascal compilers have special integer types and promotion rules.</p>
<p>C formerly considered integer and <a href="/wiki/Pointer.html" title="Pointer">pointer</a> types to be the same, but this concept proved problematic, especially in machines that had different sizes for the two. In ANSI C, they are separate.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Character types">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Character_types" id="Character_types"></a></p>
<h3>Character types</h3>
<p>C has no specific character type, and, as mentioned above, the type char is interchangeable with integer types in C. Expressions such as <code>'x'+1</code> are therefore perfectly legal, as are declarations such as <code>int i='i';</code> and <code>char c=74;</code></p>
<p>In Pascal, character types are distinct types, and are rarely used as general integers. A character (like most simple types) may be converted to an integer via the function <b>ord</b>. An integer may be converted into a character with the function <b>chr</b>.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Boolean types">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Boolean_types" id="Boolean_types"></a></p>
<h3>Boolean types</h3>
<p>In Pascal, <b><a href="/wiki/Boolean_datatype.html" title="Boolean datatype">boolean</a></b> is an enumerated type. The possible values of <b>boolean</b> are <b>false</b> and <b>true</b>. For conversion to <b>integer</b>, <b>ord</b> is used:</p>
<pre>
i := <b>ord</b>(b);
</pre>
<p>There is no language special function for <b>integer</b> to <b>boolean</b>, however, the conversion is in practice simple:</p>
<pre>
b := i &lt;&gt; 0;
</pre>
<p>Neither K&amp;R C or the first ISO Standard included support for a specific boolean type. The 1999 revision of the C Standard introduced the type <b>_Bool</b>, with <b>false</b> represented by zero and <b>true</b> represented by any non-zero value. All versions of C have supported binary <u>valued</u> relational operators (<b>&lt;</b>, <b>&gt;</b>, <b>==</b>, <b>!</b>, <b>!=</b>, <b>&lt;=</b>, <b>&gt;=</b>) which may be regarded as boolean in the sense that they always give results which are either zero or one.</p>
<p>The C programmer may also use <a href="/wiki/Bitwise_operation.html" title="Bitwise operation">bitwise</a> <a href="/wiki/Operator_%28programming%29.html" title="Operator (programming)">operators</a> for boolean operations. In many cases, the effect is the same, however, this is not guaranteed. For example, while <code>!0</code> (boolean NOT 0) is always equal to 1, <code>~0</code> (bitwise NOT 0) is usually equal to -1 (on most computers). The programmer must pay attention to whether the operands were intended as boolean or bit values.</p>
<p>As relational operators implicitly map all non-zero values onto 1, expressions such as <code> !!i</code> or <code>i != 0</code> (analogous to Pascal example above) are often used to convert integers into binary (boolean) values.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Bitwise operations">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Bitwise_operations" id="Bitwise_operations"></a></p>
<h5>Bitwise operations</h5>
<p>The C programmer may also use <a href="/wiki/Bitwise_operation.html" title="Bitwise operation">bitwise</a> <a href="/wiki/Operator_%28programming%29.html" title="Operator (programming)">operators</a> for boolean operations. In many cases, the effect is the same, however, this is not guaranteed. For example, while <code>!0</code> (boolean NOT 0) is always equal to 1, <code>~0</code> (bitwise NOT 0) is usually equal to -1 (on most computers). The programmer must pay attention to whether the operands were intended as boolean or bit values.</p>
<p>In Pascal dialects with bitwise operations (such as Borland), the relational operator symbols (<b>and</b>, <b>or</b>, etc) have bitwise semantics for operands which are integer typed, while retaining traditional boolean semantics for boolean operands (<i>overloaded</i> in popular terms). Thus, harder typing reduces the need for a plethora of operand <u>symbols</u>.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: A note on implementation">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="A_note_on_implementation" id="A_note_on_implementation"></a></p>
<h5>A note on implementation</h5>
<p>During expression evaluation, and in <i>both languages</i>, a boolean value may be internally stored as a single bit, a single byte, a full machine word, a position in the generated code, or as a condition code in a status register, depending on machine, compiler, and situation; these factors are usually more important than the language compiled.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Language versions">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Language_versions" id="Language_versions"></a></p>
<h5>Language versions</h5>
<p>Neither K&amp;R C nor the first ISO Standard had a specific boolean type. The 1999 revision of the C Standard introduced the type <b>_Bool</b>. Practically all versions of C have supported binary valued relational operators however.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Floating point types">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Floating_point_types" id="Floating_point_types"></a></p>
<h3>Floating point types</h3>
<p>There is little difference between C and Pascal regarding <a href="/wiki/Floating_point.html" title="Floating point">floating point</a> types. In C, integers may be implicitly converted to floating point numbers, and vice versa (the latter may generate a warning however). In Pascal, integers may be implicitly converted to <b>real</b>, but conversion of <b>real</b> to <b>integer</b> (where information may be lost) must be done via the functions <b>trunc</b> and <b>round</b>, which <a href="/wiki/Truncation.html" title="Truncation">truncate</a> or <a href="/wiki/Rounding.html" title="Rounding">round</a> off the fraction, respectively.</p>
<p>Perhaps the name <b>real</b> (from mathematics) may in itself be regarded as reflecting Pascal's high level intentions, while the terms float and double (from computer technology) fits the more technical and low level or pragmatic attitude of the C language.</p>

<h2>Structured types</h2>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Array types">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Array_types" id="Array_types"></a></p>
<h3>Array types</h3>
<p>Both C and Pascal allow <a href="/wiki/Array.html" title="Array">arrays</a> of other complex types, including other arrays. However, there the similarity between the languages ends. C arrays are simply defined by a base type and the number of elements:</p>
<pre>
<b>int</b> a[SIZE];
</pre>
<p>and are always indexed from 0 up to SIZE-1 (i.e. modulo SIZE).</p>
<p>In Pascal, the range of indices is often specified by a subrange (as introduced under simple types above). The ten elements of</p>
<pre>
<b>var</b> a : <b>array</b> [0..9] <b>of integer</b>;
</pre>
<p>would be indexed by 0..9 (just as in C in this case). Array indices can be any ordinal type, however, not just ranges:</p>
<pre>
<b>type</b>
   color = (red, green, blue);       (* enumeration *)
   RGB = <b>array</b> [color] <b>of</b> 0..255;

<b>var</b> picture : <b>array</b> [1..640,1..480] <b>of</b> RGB
</pre>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Arrays and pointers">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Arrays_and_pointers" id="Arrays_and_pointers"></a></p>
<h4>Arrays and pointers</h4>
<p>In C expressions, an identifier representing an array is treated as a constant pointer to the first element of the array, thus, given the declarations <code><b>int</b> a[10]</code> and <code><b>int</b> *p;</code> the assignment <code>p = a</code> is valid and causes p and a to point to the same array. As the identifier <code>a</code> represents a <u>constant</u> address, <code>a = p</code> is not valid however.</p>
<p>While arrays in C are fixed, pointers to them are interchangeable. This flexibility allows C to manipulate any length array using the same code. It also leaves the programmer with the responsibility not to write outside the allocated array, as no checks are built in into the language itself.</p>
<p>In Pascal, arrays are a distinct type from pointers. This makes <a href="/wiki/Bounds_checking.html" title="Bounds checking">bounds checking</a> for arrays possible from a compiler perspective. Practically all Pascal compilers support range checking as a compile option. The ability to both have array that change length at runtime, and be able to check them under language control, is often termed "dynamic arrays".</p>
<p>Original Pascal lacked a function analogous to C's <b>sizeof</b> function, which is often used to obtain the size of a statically initialized array in C code. For instance in the following code, the terminating index for the loop automatically adjusts should the list of strings be changed.</p>
<pre>
static char *wordlist[] = {
   "print",   "out",   "the",  "text",   "message" };
static int listSize = (sizeof(wordlist)/sizeof(char *));
int i;

for (i=0; i&lt;listSize; i++)
   puts(wordlist[i]);

<p><a name="Strings" id="Strings"></a></p>
<h3>Strings</h3>
<p>Neither C nor Pascal have more than rudimenary support for character <a href="/wiki/String_%28computer_science%29.html" title="String (computer science)">strings</a>, and both also (reasonably) considers strings to be a special case of the array. In both languages, it's the programmers responsibility to determine the (runtime) length of a string stored in a character array.</p>
<p>C automatically terminates string literals with a trailing null-character as an end-of-string "sentinel":</p>
<pre>
char *p;
p = "the rain in Spain";     /* null-terminated */
</pre>
<p>Null-termination must be manually maintained for string variables stored in arrays (this is often partly handled by library routines). C does not have built in string or array assignment, so the string is not actually being transferred to p, but rather p is being made to point to the constant string in memory.</p>
<p>Pascal does have array assignment and string literals may be assigned to packed character arrays that has starting index 1, however, the length must match the type exactly:</p>
<pre>
type string = packed array [1..20] of char;
var s: string;
s := 'the rain in Spain  ';     (* actual copying *)
</pre>
<p>Pascal strings are conceptually of equal length and string literals must be padded out to force type equality (it is most common to pad strings with spaces on the right side, but this is purely a programmer convention). This, along with the general lack of dynamic string support, is considered to be a problem with the language, many Pascal implementations therefore have dynamic strings as a language extension.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Record types">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Record_types" id="Record_types"></a></p>
<h3>Record types</h3>
<p>Both C and Pascal can declare <a href="/wiki/Object_composition.html" title="Object composition">record</a> types. In C, they are termed "structures".</p>
<pre>
struct a {
   int b;
   char c;
};
</pre>
<pre>
type a = record 
   b: integer;
   c: char
end;
</pre>
<p>In C, the exact bit length of a field can be specified:</p>
<pre>
struct a {
   int b:3;
   int c:1;
};
</pre>
<p>Contrary to popular opinion, this can also be done in Pascal by using the subrange construct (3 bits gives a range from 0 to 7):</p>
<pre>
type a = record
   b: 0..7;
   c: 0..1
end;
</pre>
<p>However, the compiler must support packing of records to the bit level.</p>
<p>Both C and Pascal can have records which have different fields overlapping each other:</p>
<pre>
union a {
   int a;
   float b;
};
</pre>
<pre>
type a = record
   case boolean of
      false: (a: integer);
      true:  (b: real)
end;
</pre>
<p>Both language processors are free to allocate only as much space for these records as needed to contain the largest type in the union/record.</p>
<p>The biggest difference between C and Pascal is that Pascal allows the use of a "tagfield" for the language processor to determine if the valid component of the variant record is being accessed:</p>
<pre>
type a = record
   case q: boolean of
      false: (a: integer);
      true:  (b: real)
end;
</pre>
<p>In this case, the tagfield q must be set to the right state to access the proper parts of the record.</p>
<p>C, in its original version, could not assign objects having a struct type or pass them to functions (Pascal can). Structure assignment was however, widely implemented in 'C' compilers by the mid 1980s. Passing structures, and not just pointers to structures, was later implemented by many compilers. This capability was added to C in C99.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Pointers">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Pointers" id="Pointers"></a></p>
<h2>Pointers</h2>
<p>In C, pointers can be made to point at most program objects, even constant objects or functions:</p>
<pre>
int a;
int *b;
int (*compare)(int c, int d);
int  MyCompare( int c, int d);

b = &amp;a;
compare = &amp;MyCompare;
</pre>
<p>In C, since arrays and pointers are equivalent, the following are the same:</p>
<pre>
a = b[5];
a = *(b+5);
</pre>
<p>Thus, pointers are often used in C as just another method to access arrays.</p>
<p>To create dynamic data, the library functions "malloc" and "free" are used to obtain and release dynamic blocks of data. Thus, <a href="/wiki/Dynamic_memory_allocation.html" title="Dynamic memory allocation">dynamic memory allocation</a> is not built into the language processor.</p>
<p>In Pascal, pointers are much more restricted. Each pointer is bound to a single dynamic data item, and can only be moved by assignment:</p>
<pre>
type a = ^integer;

var b, c: a;

new(b);
c := b;
</pre>
<p>In Pascal, pointers can never point to program objects such as variables. This tends to make Pascal more type safe than C, but not completely type safe. Pascal can still have invalid pointer references in several ways. For example, a pointer can be referenced when uninitialized, or it would be referenced after it is disposed, etc.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Expressions">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Expressions" id="Expressions"></a></p>
<h2>Expressions</h2>
<p>The languages differ significantly when it comes to expression evaluation, C (although not fully comparable) has almost four times as many presedence levels as Pascal.</p>
<p><i>Pascal has four levels:</i></p>
<ol>
<li><i>Logical negation:</i> <code><b>not</b></code></li>
<li><i>Multiplicative:</i> <code><b>* / div mod and</b></code></li>
<li><i>Additive:</i> <code><b>+ - or</b></code></li>
<li><i>Relational:</i> <code><b>= &lt;&gt; &lt; &gt; &lt;= &gt;= in</b></code></li>
</ol>
<p><i>while C has 15 levels:</i></p>
<ol>
<li><i>Unary postfix:</i> <code><b>[] () . -&gt; ++ --</b></code></li>
<li><i>Unary prefix:</i> <code><b>&amp; * + - ! ~ ++ -- (type) sizeof</b></code></li>
<li><i>Multiplicative:</i> <code><b>* / %</b></code></li>
<li><i>Additive:</i> <code><b>+ -</b></code></li>
<li><i>Skift:</i> <code><b>&lt;&lt; &gt;&gt;</b></code></li>

</ol>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Typing">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Typing" id="Typing"></a></p>
<h4>Typing</h4>
<p>Most operators serve several purposes in Pascal, for instance, the minus sign may be used for negation, subtraction, or set difference (depending on both type and syntactical context), the &gt;= operator may be used to compare numbers, strings, or sets, and so on. C uses dedicated operator symbols to a greater extent.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Logical connectives">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Logical_connectives" id="Logical_connectives"></a></p>
<h4>Logical connectives</h4>
<p>As C encourages "side" effects from expression evaluations, <i>state</i> becomes a matter even inside expressions (not only between them) to a much greater extent than in Pascal. C therefore has special logical connectives, &amp;&amp; and ||, which <i>never</i> evaluate the right operand if the result can be determined from the left alone, sometimes called lasy evaluation or short circuiting.</p>
<p>In Pascal an expression that relies on a particular evaluation ordering is, more or less, an error. The compiler has the freedom to use whatever ordering it may prefer. It may, for example, use lasy evaluation (jump code) where this is considered "optimal", while emploing numerical boolean calculations in other parts of the expression and/or the program. C compilers has a similar freedom when &amp; and | are used (instead of &amp;&amp; and ||), at least in those cases where it can deduce that the boolean result is the sole purpose and the bitwise value can be discarded.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Control structures">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Control_structures" id="Control_structures"></a></p>
<h2>Control structures</h2>
<p>Statements for building control structures are roughly analogous and relatively similar (at least the first three).</p>
<p><i>Pascal has:</i></p>
<ul>
<li><b>if</b> <i>cond</i> <b>then</b> <i>stmt</i> <b>else</b> <i>stmt</i></li>
<li><b>while</b> <i>cond</i> <b>do</b> <i>stmt</i></li>
<li><b>repeat</b> <i>stmt</i> <b>until</b> <i>cond</i></li>
<li><b>for</b> <i>id</i> := <i>expr</i> <b>to</b> <i>expr</i> <b>do</b> <i>stmt</i></li>
<li><b>case</b> <i>expr</i> <b>of</b> <i>expr</i> <b>:</b> <i>stmt</i>; ... <i>expr</i> <b>:</b> <i>stmt</i>; <b>end</b></li>
</ul>
<p><i>C has:</i></p>
<ul>
<li><b>if</b> (<i>cond</i>) <i>stmt</i> <b>else</b> <i>stmt</i></li>
<li><b>while</b> (<i>cond</i>) <i>stmt</i></li>
<li><b>do</b> <i>stmt</i> <b>while</b> (<i>cond</i>)</li>
<li><b>for</b> (<i>expr</i>; <i>expr</i>; <i>expr</i>) <i>stmt</i></li>
<li><b>switch</b> (<i>expr</i>) { <b>case</b> <i>expr</i> <b>:</b> <i>stmt</i>; ... <b>case</b> <i>expr</i> <b>:</b> <i>stmt</i>; <b>default:</b> <i>stmt</i> }</li>
</ul>
<p>Pascal, in its original form, did not have an equivalent to <b>default</b>, but an equivalent <b>else</b> clause is a common extension. Pascal programmers instead often guard case-statements with an expression such as: <b>if</b> <i>expr</i> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> [A..B] <b>then</b> <i>default-case</i>.</p>
<p>C has the so called early-out statements <b>break</b> and <b>continue</b>, Pascal does not. There is controversy about whether the inclusion of these statements is in keeping with structured programming methodology. The best that can be said about this is that the use of break and continue may make programming easier, but there is no case where they cannot be replaced by "orthodox" structured programming constructs.</p>
<p>Both C and Pascal have a <b>goto</b> statement. However, Pascal allows jumps between different procedures or functions, which is commonly used to implement error recovery. C has got this capability via the ANSI C <a href="/wiki/Setjmp/longjmp.html" title="Setjmp/longjmp">setjmp and longjmp</a>. This is equivalent, but cumbersome to use, because you must arrange for longjmp both before and after the jump has been executed.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Functions/Procedures">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Functions.2FProcedures" id="Functions.2FProcedures"></a></p>
<h2>Functions/Procedures</h2>
<p>In Pascal, routines that return a value are called functions, and routines that don't return a value are called procedures. In C all routines are called functions, however routines that do not return a value are declared to return "void", meaning that they do not return anything. Actually "void" is not really a valid variable type, it can only be used when declaring the return type of a function. It cannot be used for declaring normal variables of this type, for example.</p>
<p>In practice Pascal procedures are equivalent to C functions that return "void", and Pascal functions are equivalent to C functions that return a non-void type.</p>
<p>The following two declarations in C:</p>
<pre>
int f(int x, int y);
void k(int q);
</pre>
<p>are equivalent to the following declarations in Pascal:</p>
<pre>
function f(x, y: integer): integer;
procedure k(q: integer);
</pre>
<p>In Pascal, there are two different types of parameters, value and pass by reference or VAR parameters. In C, there are only value parameters, but the C ability to point to any variable allows the programmer to construct their own pass by reference scheme:</p>
<pre>
int f(int *k);
x = f(&amp;t);
</pre>
<pre>
function f(var k: integer): integer;

x := f(t);
</pre>
<p>In C, it is possible to create a function with any number of parameters:</p>
<pre>
int f(int a, ...);
f(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
</pre>
<p>The function f uses a special set of functions that allow it to access each of the parameters in turn. This set of functions was undefined in original C, but was defined in ANSI C. In practice, this feature is easy to call to, but fairly complex, and was machine dependent, to create functions that are called using it. Perhaps because of this, it is mainly used to form the language support library for C, specifically I/O.</p>
<p>Pascal has no equivalent to C's n-parameter feature. However, Pascal has I/O statements built-in to the language, so there is less need for it. Pascal allows procedures and functions to be <a href="/wiki/Nested_function.html" title="Nested function">nested</a>. This is convenient to allow variables that are local to a group of procedures, but not global. C does not have this feature and the localization of variables or functions could only be done for a compilation module wherein the variables or functions would have been declared <b>static</b>.</p>
<p>C allows functions to be indirectly invoked through a function pointer:</p>
<pre>
int (*cmpar)(char *a, char *b);
char *s1, *s2;
cmpar = &amp;strcmp;
.
.
b = (*cmpar)( s1, s2 );
</pre>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Preprocessor">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Preprocessor" id="Preprocessor"></a></p>
<h2>Preprocessor</h2>
<p>The C language was originally defined as needing a "<a href="/wiki/Preprocessor.html" title="Preprocessor">preprocessor</a>", which was a separate pass that handled constant, type, include and <a href="/wiki/Macro.html" title="Macro">macro</a> definitions to keep memory usage down. This was required since the first C didn't have either constant declarations nor type declarations. However, C obtained those features later with ANSI C.</p>
<p>Pascal wasn't defined with a standardized preprocessor, but several programmers did use it with a preprocessor, sometimes the same one that was used with C. It certainly was not as common as preprocessor use with C, but Pascal had constant and type defines, so the remaining use for the preprocessor was include files and macros.</p>
<p>Although this is often pointed at as a "lack" in Pascal, technically C didn't have program modularity nor macros built in either, and both languages could just as well be equipped with a preprocessor.</p>
<p>As a practical matter, most of the succeeding versions of Pascal used a type controlled modular method instead of include files, so the need for a preprocessor is largely redundant. Include files are sometimes used, but only for special cases, not for the general program structure</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Type escapes">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Type_escapes" id="Type_escapes"></a></p>
<h2>Type escapes</h2>
<p>C, in keeping with its loose typing requirements, features the ability to "cast" a type to become another:</p>
<pre>
int a;
float b;

a = (int) b;
</pre>
<p>The meaning of such casts is entirely machine dependent. This feature often helps with low level conversion of data. For example, a floating point value can be output to a <a href="/wiki/Computer_file.html" title="Computer file">file</a> as a series of <a href="/wiki/Byte.html" title="Byte">bytes</a>.</p>
<p>Again contrary to popular opinion, Pascal can also do this, with a considerably more complicated method:</p>
<pre>
var a: integer;
    b: real;
    a2c: record
           case boolean of
             false: (a: integer);
             true:  (b: real);
           end;
         end;
begin
  a2c.b := b;
  a := a2c.a;
end;
</pre>
<p>In Pascal, such type conversions are discouraged, hence the difficulty.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Files">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Files" id="Files"></a></p>
<h2>Files</h2>
<p>In C files do not exist as a builtin type (they are defined in a system header) and all I/O takes place via library calls. Pascal has file handling built into the language.</p>
<p>The typical statements used to perform I/O in each language are:</p>
<pre>
printf("The sum is: %d\n", x);
</pre>
<pre>
writeln('the sum is: ', x);
</pre>
<p>The main difference is that C uses a "format string" that is interpreted to find the arguments to the printf function and convert them, whereas Pascal performs that under the control of the language processor. The Pascal method is arguably faster, because no interpretation takes place, but the C method is highly extensible.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Extensions to Pascal">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Extensions_to_Pascal" id="Extensions_to_Pascal"></a></p>
<h2>Extensions to Pascal</h2>
<p>Some popular Pascal implementations have removed virtually all differences with C by incorporating C methods and constructs into Pascal. Examples include type casts, being able to obtain the address of any variable, local or global, and different types of integers with special promotion properties.</p>
<p>However, in languages it is not true that you can have your cake and eat it too. The incorporation of C's cavalier attitude towards types and type conversions can result in a Pascal that loses some of its type security. For example, <a href="/wiki/Java_programming_language.html" title="Java programming language">Java</a> and C# were created to address some of the type security issues of C, and have "managed" pointers that cannot be used to create invalid references. In its original form (as described by <a href="/wiki/Niklaus_Wirth.html" title="Niklaus Wirth">Niklaus Wirth</a>), Pascal qualifies as a managed pointer language, some 30 years before either Java or C#. However, a Pascal amalgamated with C would lose that protection.</p>

<h2>Generated code</h2>
<p>Both languages are intended to be easy to compile into efficient machine code. There are three significant differences however.</p>

<p><a name="Nested_procedures_with_lexical_scope" id="Nested_procedures_with_lexical_scope"></a></p>
<h5>Nested procedures with lexical scope</h5>
<p>Pascal has nested procedures with lexical scope, which means that the Pascal compiler has to generate code to follow <a  class="new" title="Static link">access links</a> embedded in the <a href="/wiki/Activation_record.html" title="Activation record">activation records</a> of procedures (or a faster, so called display). This may hamper performance somewhat under certain circumstances, at least when using a simple compiler which is not capable of factoring out references to non-local variables (via access links).</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Explicit pointers">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Explicit_pointers" id="Explicit_pointers"></a></p>
<h5>Explicit pointers</h5>
<p>C programs relies heavily on explicit pointers. Possible pointer aliasing means that optimizations becomes very difficult. Without detailed analysis (also over file boundaries), the compiler must often assume that writes through a pointer may write <i>anywhere</i>. The C convention of traversing arrays via pointers ( *p++ ) instead of using the index operator ( A[i++] ) were perhaps "optimal" on machines like the PDP-8 (were <i>total</i> code size was important), for which the first C implementations were targeted.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Call mechanism">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Call_mechanism" id="Call_mechanism"></a></p>
<h5>Call mechanism</h5>
<p>In C the caller (not the callee) is responsible for removing pushed parameters from the stack after the callee has returned. This is a way to permit (runtime) variable-sized parameter-lists, but it has the side effect of making the generated code somewhat less compact, and therefore less likely to fit into the L1-caches of today's microprocessors (which reduces performance).</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Epilogue">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Epilogue" id="Epilogue"></a></p>
<h2>Epilogue</h2>
<p>It is difficult to produce a truly impartial comparison of C and Pascal, and even more difficult to avoid offending one or another language aficionado.</p>
<p>However, C and Pascal are extraordinarily similar languages, if you look at the basic program structures, data and aims of the two languages. Each time a proponent of C claims that program X cannot be done in Pascal, someone else shows that it can be done. Each time a proponent of Pascal claims that program Y cannot be made machine independent in C, someone else shows that this, too, can be done.</p>
<p>About the only fault with original Pascal that everyone agrees on is the lack of dynamic arrays, which even the creator of Pascal later agreed was not a good idea. Many, or even most later Pascal compilers added an extension for that problem, and the ISO 7185 standard addressed it as well.</p>
<p>The remaining major difference between the languages that everyone agrees on is type security. This is neither the runaway emergency for C that many claim (you can program array checks in C, you just have to do it yourself), nor the massive lack for Pascal (you can escape types in Pascal, it is just made painful on purpose).</p>
<p>Although C was originally described as a "systems" or "low level" language, it is clearly used for all applications, including high level ones, a fact, or a regrettable fact, depending on your viewpoint!</p>
