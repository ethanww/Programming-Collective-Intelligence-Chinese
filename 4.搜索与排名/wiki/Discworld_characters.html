<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: 71-Hour Ahmed">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="71-Hour_Ahmed"></a></p>
<h2>71-Hour Ahmed</h2>
<p>A <a href="/wiki/Klatch.html" title="Klatch">Klatchian</a> warrior who accompanies the Klatchian envoy Prince Khufurah on a diplomatic journey to Ankh-Morpork in the novel <i><a href="/wiki/Jingo_%28novel%29.html" title="Jingo (novel)">Jingo</a></i>. He speaks with a heavy accent and has a penchant for chewing on cloves. Following an attempt on the prince's life by an unknown assassin, he is suspected of killing the Watch's prime suspect, provoking Vimes and other Watch members to pursue him back to Klatch (Particularly after he captures Angua in werewolf form).</p>
<p>Apart from belonging to a vicious but honorable warrior clan known as the <a  class="new" title="D'reg">D'regs</a>, he is later revealed to be a Klatchian equivalent of a watchman on par with Vimes. It also turns out his obsessive clove-chewing and broken Morporkian are in fact a disguise meant to delude foreigners into falsely assuming he is nothing but an uncivilized barbarian. He and Vimes eventually develop a wary respect for each other, mostly based on both of them being basically-honest cops in unenviable positions</p>
<p>He got his nickname after killing a man (guilty of poisoning a well, and killing a number of villagers and very valuable camels) one hour before the traditional D'reg three days of hospitality, during which even your greatest enemy should be shown respect, would have run out.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Anghammarad">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Anghammarad" id="Anghammarad"></a></p>
<h2>Anghammarad</h2>
<p>Anghammarad is a minor character in the novel <i><a href="/wiki/Going_Postal.html" title="Going Postal">Going Postal</a></i>. He is a <a href="/wiki/Golems_%28Discworld%29.html" title="Golems (Discworld)">golem</a>, almost nineteen thousand years old, having been baked by the priests of Upsa in the Third Ning of the Shaving of the Goat. He was also given a voice. However, Upsa was destroyed by the explosion of Mount Shiputu. He then spent two centuries under a mountain of <a href="/wiki/Pumice.html" title="Pumice">pumice</a>, before it eroded away. He then became a messenger for the Fisherman Kings of the holy Ult.</p>
<p>More recently, he delivered the decrees of King Het of Thut. That is, he delivered them until the land of Thut slid under the sea. He then spent nine thousand years in the deep ocean, before being netted by a fisherman. While having returned to civilization, he still carried the message warning Het that the sea goddess is angry, and hoped to deliver it (golems believe time is cyclical, and Anghammarad thought that if he waited long enough, he'd be able to get it right the second time around).</p>
<p>He worked for the <a href="/wiki/Ankh-Morpork.html" title="Ankh-Morpork">Ankh-Morpork</a> Post Office (in the honorary position of Extremely Senior Postman) before his briefly white-hot ceramic body was engulfed with cold water while fighting a catastrophic fire in the post office building. The resulting explosion ended his life. He asked Death to allow him to remain at the entrance to the afterlife, equating an absence of tasks to perform with perfect freedom.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Adora Belle Dearheart">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Adora_Belle_Dearheart" id="Adora_Belle_Dearheart"></a></p>
<h2>Adora Belle Dearheart</h2>
<p>The daughter of John Dearheart, founder of the <a href="/wiki/Grand_Trunk_Semaphore_Company.html" title="Grand Trunk Semaphore Company">Grand Trunk Semaphore Company</a>, Adora Belle Dearheart (featured in <i><a href="/wiki/Going_Postal.html" title="Going Postal">Going Postal</a></i>) is cynical, miserable and a heavy smoker (so memorably heavy that the most effective way of finding her in an emergency turns out to be to inquire at her tobacconist). She lives above a tobacconist in <a href="/wiki/Ankh-Morpork.html" title="Ankh-Morpork">Ankh-Morpork</a>. There are hints in the novel that she is beginning a relationship with <a  title="">Moist von Lipwig</a>.</p>
<p>We are first introduced to Adora Belle at her place of work, the Golem Trust.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: B'hrian Bloodaxe">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="B.27hrian_Bloodaxe" id="B.27hrian_Bloodaxe"></a></p>
<h2>B'hrian Bloodaxe</h2>
<p>The first Low King of the <a href="/wiki/Dwarfs_%28Discworld%29.html" title="Dwarfs (Discworld)">Dwarfs</a>, and a great cultural hero. His life is told in the opera <i>Bloodaxe and Ironhammer</i>. He was the lover of Ironhammer, who forged the Scone of Stone (a reference to the <a href="/wiki/Stone_of_Scone.html" title="Stone of Scone">Stone of Scone</a>). Ironhammer killed himself (all dwarves are called 'he,' even females) when falsely told of Bloodaxe's death. Bloodaxe was subsequently killed at the <a href="/wiki/Minor_Discworld_concepts#Battle_of_Koom_Valley.html" title="Minor Discworld concepts">Battle of Koom Valley</a>. Accorging to legend he killed 57 <a href="/wiki/Troll_%28Discworld%29.html" title="Troll (Discworld)">trolls</a> there, and a loaf of Battle Bread that he supposedly wielded has become a cultural icon and is in the Dwarf Bread Museum in <a href="/wiki/Ankh-Morpork.html" title="Ankh-Morpork">Ankh-Morpork</a>. However, in <i><a href="/wiki/Thud%21.html" title="Thud!">Thud!</a></i> it's revealed that he was trying to <i>prevent</i> the battle when a flash flood trapped him in a sinkhole. The Battle Bread found next to Bloodaxe's body casts doubt on the authenticity of the A-MDBM loaf, unless of course he carried more than one.</p>
<p>Bloodaxe was first mentioned in <i><a href="/wiki/Feet_of_Clay.html" title="Feet of Clay">Feet of Clay</a></i>, and his full history was revealed in <i><a href="/wiki/The_Fifth_Elephant.html" title="The Fifth Elephant">The Fifth Elephant</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Thud_%28novel%29.html" title="Thud (novel)">Thud!</a></i>. His name is possibly based on <i><a href="/wiki/Brian_Bloodaxe.html" title="Brian Bloodaxe">Brian Bloodaxe</a></i>, a <a href="/wiki/Computer_game.html" title="Computer game">computer game</a> character from the 1980s. The character is also possibly based on <a href="/wiki/Brian_Boru.html" title="Brian Boru">Brian Boru</a>, a 10th century Irish king.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Brick">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Brick" id="Brick"></a></p>
<h2>Brick</h2>
<p>Brick is a young <a href="/wiki/Troll_%28Discworld%29.html" title="Troll (Discworld)">troll</a> in the novel <i><a href="/wiki/Thud%21.html" title="Thud!">Thud!</a></i>. He is described as being emaciated by troll standards, and having a texture and pattern to his skin that makes him resemble a brick wall (due to being made of "<a href="/wiki/Troll_%28Discworld%29#Biology.html" title="Troll (Discworld)">metamorphorical rock</a>" and having been born in Ankh-Morpork). <a href="/wiki/Samuel_Vimes.html" title="Samuel Vimes">Samuel Vimes</a>, upon seeing him, classified him as the loser's loser. Brick regularly used troll drugs bummed off of the few gutter trolls who didn't run him off when they saw him--and he knew how to make Scrape, a low-class troll drug. Eventually, Sergeant <a href="/wiki/Detritus_%28Discworld%29.html" title="Detritus (Discworld)">Detritus</a> of the City Watch takes in Brick and seems to unofficially adopt him. Detritus was convinced of Brick's potential after Brick was found still conscious, and, what's more, still <i>walking</i> after having a few mugs of a potent troll beverage, the name of which translates to Big Hammer.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Brutha">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Brutha" id="Brutha"></a></p>
<h2>Brutha</h2>
<p>Originally an <a href="/wiki/Omnian.html" title="Omnian">Omnian</a> novice in the Citadel of Kom, noted only for being a simple boy with an apparently perfect memory. Brutha was the main character in <i><a href="/wiki/Small_Gods.html" title="Small Gods">Small Gods</a></i>, in which he found himself Chosen by the Great God <a href="/wiki/Om_%28Discworld%29.html" title="Om (Discworld)">Om</a> because he was the only person who really believed in the god. He went on to become the Eighth Prophet of Om and Cenobiarch of <a href="/wiki/Omnia.html" title="Omnia">Omnia</a>, and transformed Omnianism into a religion of tolerance and understanding (though it is shown in <a href="/wiki/Carpe_Jugulum.html" title="Carpe Jugulum">Carpe Jugulum</a> that it did not remain thus for long). He died 100 years later, although exactly <i>when</i> these 100 years occurred is a matter of some confusion. An example of Brutha's memory is given when he says that his earliest memory is that <i>"there was a bright light. Then somebody hit me."</i> referring to the slap a doctor gives a baby after it is born to make it breathe.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Carcer Dun">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Carcer_Dun" id="Carcer_Dun"></a></p>
<h2>Carcer Dun</h2>
<p>The villain of <i><a href="/wiki/Night_Watch_%28novel%29.html" title="Night Watch (novel)">Night Watch</a></i>, described by Vimes as "a stone-cold killer. With brains."</p>
<p>Carcer is a textbook <a href="/wiki/Psychopathic.html" title="Psychopathic">psychopathic</a> killer, completely lacking in conscience or empathy. His impulse control is highly selective ("That was one thing about Carcer, at least - he wouldn't shoot you in the back if he thought there was a reasonable chance, pretty soon, of cutting your throat."). Judging by his enthusiasm for his job in the past as a Cable Street Particular and his glee at the discovery of the younger Sam Vimes (Whether he wanted to kill the younger Vimes or corrupt his future nemesis to become like him is unknown; he seemed tempted to do both at different times), Carcer seems to have <a href="/wiki/Sadistic_personality_disorder.html" title="Sadistic personality disorder">sadistic personality disorder</a>.</p>
<p>Carcer and Vimes could fairly be said to be two sides of the same coin. Where Vimes instinctively cleaves to the role of protector, Carcer uses the talents the two men share (motivation and manipulation of others, a talent for dirty fighting, a gift for strategy, knowledge of police procedure and knowledge of and skill with illegal concealed weapons, to name a few) as a predator, killing people for no other reason than to apparently steal a five-dollar watch.</p>
<p>Carcer's last name was shown in a preview of <i>Night Watch</i>, but never revealed in the completed book.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Christine">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Christine" id="Christine"></a></p>

<h2>General Tacticus</h2>
<p>A soldier of the <a href="/wiki/Ankh-Morpork.html" title="Ankh-Morpork">Ankh-Morpork</a> Empire proclaimed to be the greatest general of all time. In fact, on the Discworld the word 'tactics' was derived from his name. Though he is dead at the time of the events contained in the series, his legacy lives on.</p>
<p>He is an amalgamation of various historic characters, including <a href="/wiki/General_George_Patton.html" title="General George Patton">General George Patton</a>, <a href="/wiki/Alexander_the_Great.html" title="Alexander the Great">Alexander the Great</a>, <a href="/wiki/Marcus_Aurelius.html" title="Marcus Aurelius">Marcus Aurelius</a> and <a href="/wiki/Julius_Caesar.html" title="Julius Caesar">Julius Caesar</a>, which latter can be seen in the title of his autobiography, <i>VENI VIDI VICI: A Soldier's Life</i>. "<i>Veni Vidi Vici</i>" - "I came, I saw, I conquered" is arguably the most famous thing Julius Caesar ever said and "A Soldier's Life" seems to be a popular title for a number of military biographies and autobiographies. Tacticus' name, while some suggest the Roman historian <a href="/wiki/Tacitus.html" title="Tacitus">Tacitus</a>, is most likely a reference to two early Greek writers on the art of war: <a href="/wiki/Aeneas_Tacticus.html" title="Aeneas Tacticus">Aeneas Tacticus</a> and <a href="/wiki/Aelianus_Tacticus.html" title="Aelianus Tacticus">Aelianus Tacticus</a>.

His later career suggests that of General Jean Baptiste Jules Bernadotte, later King <a href="/wiki/Charles_XIV_John_of_Sweden.html" title="Charles XIV John of Sweden">Charles XIV John of Sweden</a>.</p>
<p>Tacticus conquered a large area of the Discworld, both around the base city of Ankh-Morpork and well into the southern continent of <a href="/wiki/Klatch.html" title="Klatch">Klatch</a>. At one point, the far-flung city of <a href="/wiki/Genua.html" title="Genua">Genua</a>, having run out of royalty of their own, asked Ankh-Morpork for a Duke. Tacticus was made a Duke and sent there. Immediately upon becoming a Genuan citizen, he evaluated the military threats posed by other nations, and declared war on Ankh-Morpork.</p>
<p>When Vimes got a copy of Tacticus' autobiography from the Librarian, he formulated a very Vimes-like opinion as to why history did not particularly like Tacticus (because he didn't get a huge number of his men killed out of his own arrogance and incompetence). Snippets of Tacticus advice turns up in various Discworld chronicles, and it can be gathered that he was a very realistic general (The section of his autobiography entitled "What to Do When One Army Occupies a Well-Fortified and Superior Ground and the Other Does Not" begins with the sentence "Endeavour to be the one inside.")</p>

Ironically, despite his rather feminine manner and distinct lack of martial prowess, he turns out to be one of the few characters in the novel who is genuinely male (while the fearsome Sergeant Jackrum turns out to be a woman). Despite this, he respects and admires the women when he learns the truth, informing their captors that "[he] would not trade them for any six men [they] offered [him]". Blouse's ambition is to have an item of clothing or a food named after him, in the manner of many famous military men. Eventually a type of fingerless glove is named for him.</p>

He succeeded Dr. Cruces after his death; before that he was his deputy. He is a kindly looking, distinguished old gentleman with white hair, eminently professional and seemingly unflappable.

He was at school with <a href="/wiki/Havelock_Vetinari.html" title="Havelock Vetinari">Havelock Vetinari</a>, where he was a bully and something of an imbecile, with a propensity for calling everyone scags, including Vetinari, whom he also referred to as dog-botherer.</p>
<p>Allegedly, Lord Downey's preferred method of inhumation is poisoning, though no deaths have yet to be attributed to him. Pratchett suggests this is probably due to the fact that he is very good at his job. His special recipe for <a href="/wiki/Humbug.html" title="Humbug">humbugs</a>, submitted to <a href="/wiki/Nanny_Ogg.html" title="Nanny Ogg">Nanny Ogg</a>, calls for "arsenic to taste", though, since arsenic is actually very traceable, this is likely a slight bit of misinformation on his part. One current tradition he maintains is inviting certain students to his office for tea.

They all <a href="/wiki/Parody.html" title="Parody">parody</a> <a href="/wiki/Vampire.html" title="Vampire">vampirism</a> in different ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Old Count, Count Magpyr's uncle. Very much a stereotyped cinematic vampire, it is no coincidence that his first name is <a href="/wiki/Bela_Lugosi.html" title="Bela Lugosi">Bela</a>. He kept his castle full of drapes that could be cast aside and ironwork that could be shaped into religious symbols. Because it was so easy to kill him temporarily, no-one ever went to the effort of doing it permanently.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Count and Countess Magpyr see themselves as modern "vampyres" unshackled by superstition. They are partially unaffected by the traditional vampire weaknesses (due to psychological <a href="/wiki/Mithridatism.html" title="Mithridatism">mithridatism</a>), and keen to avoid stereotyping. They see taking blood from villagers as "The Arrangement"; just an unusual form of taxation.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Vlad Magpyr also sees himself as a modern vampyre, but has become another stereotype; the romantic <a href="/wiki/Anne_Rice.html" title="Anne Rice">Anne Rice</a>-type vampire. He has a ponytail and wears fancy waistcoats.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Lacrimosa Magpyr embodies a reversal of "<a href="/wiki/Vampire_lifestyle.html" title="Vampire lifestyle">lifestyle vampires</a>"; an actual vampire who wears bright clothes and stays up until noon. Lacrimosa herself appears to be a vicious, sadistic, though intelligent, vampire, but some of her friends call themselves names like "Pam", file their teeth blunt and even drink... wine.</li>

<li>Magyrato, a briefly-mentioned ancestor. His portrait is unfinished, due to him attacking the artist halfway through. From what can be seen, he resembled <a href="/wiki/Graf_Orlok.html" title="Graf Orlok">Graf Orlok</a>.</li>

More properly called The Quite Reverend Mightily-Praiseworthy-Are-Ye-Who-Exalteth-Om Oats (it is shorter in Omnian), he is a priest of the <a href="/wiki/Omnian.html" title="Omnian">Omnian</a> faith who performs the naming of Esmeralda Margaret Note Spelling, Princess of <a href="/wiki/Lancre.html" title="Lancre">Lancre</a>. It's his nerves that cause him to mistakenly speak the final two words of her name out loud, although this is not (apparently) the first time this has happened at a royal naming (<a href="/wiki/Nanny_Ogg.html" title="Nanny Ogg">Nanny Ogg</a> cites a past ruler of Lancre, King Ye-Gods-He's-Heavy the 1st). He is also, quite literally, in two minds about everything, much like <a href="/wiki/Agnes_Nitt.html" title="Agnes Nitt">Agnes Nitt</a>, since he combines a strict religious upbringing with a logical mind that tends to think too hard about such things.</p>
<p>In the beginning he appears to be very much the stereotypical <a href="/wiki/Anglican.html" title="Anglican">Anglican</a> priest, constantly ensuring both sides of the argument are heard, and being painfully tolerant of others' views. After spending a long journey with <a href="/wiki/Granny_Weatherwax.html" title="Granny Weatherwax">Granny Weatherwax</a> however, he changes quite a lot, and regains his religious fire. His current location is unknown, but presumably somewhere in <a href="/wiki/%C3%9Cberwald.html" title="Überwald">Überwald</a>. While he is considered a minor character, it is almost certain that Granny would have died without his assistance, even if no one will admit it.

<h2>Moist von Lipwig</h2>
<p>A former conman, now <a href="/wiki/Ankh-Morpork.html" title="Ankh-Morpork">Ankh-Morpork</a>'s Postmaster General. The main character in <i><a href="/wiki/Going_Postal.html" title="Going Postal">Going Postal</a></i>. He was invited to take up his new position of his own free will by the <a href="/wiki/Havelock_Vetinari.html" title="Havelock Vetinari">Patrician</a> (the offered alternatives being hanging or suicide, again of his own free will), and managed to revive the Post Office by applying the principles of the con to honest work. He wears a golden suit with a wingèd cap when on duty, and, without it, looks like someone you wouldn't really notice. He is in something approaching a relationship with Adora Belle Dearheart. <a href="/wiki/As_of_2006.html" title="As of 2006">As of January, 2006</a>, he is set to star in the forthcoming novel <i><a href="/wiki/Making_Money.html" title="Making Money">Making Money</a></i>. As a confidence trickster in a book which sometimes can be said to criticise the unfettered free market, his name could be meant to mock the views of Austrian School economist <a href="/wiki/Ludwig_Von_Mises.html" title="Ludwig Von Mises">Ludwig Von Mises</a>.</p>
<p>He seems to have a very minor cameo in <i><a href="/wiki/Thud%21.html" title="Thud!">Thud!</a></i>. When Commander Vimes notices that the Ankh-Morpork Post Office has issued two different sets of stamps commemorating the battle of Koom Valley (one in which the Dwarfs are winning the battle, the other the Trolls) he makes an angry remark about "That idiot at the Post Office." Presumably he is talking about Lipwig, who as Postmaster for Ankh-Morpork has the authority to commission stamps. This would indicate there's no love lost between the Watch Commander and the Postmaster of Ankh-Morpork (which makes sense, since Vimes is a career copper and von Lipwig is a slippery con-artist).</p>
<p>His most notable trait is that he is unnoticeable. He is unrecognisable and uses this to his advantage by donning a selection of easily removable distinguishable features. He's about twenty or thirty and between 5ft 9 and 6ft 2 according to the numerous descriptions handed in to various watches across the plains; however, it's revealed in Going Postal that he's actually 26 (or so he says).</p>
<p>He's an expert forger and uses a wide range of inks and papers that he stores in what he calls "Mr. Robinson's Box"; he uses these supplies to make the post office stamps impossible to forge. He seems to have tendencies towards kleptomania as he just can't help helping himself to items left lying around by honest if careless businessmen.</p>
<p>von Lipwig bears at least a passing resemblance to James Bolivar "Slippery Jim" diGriz from <a href="/wiki/Harry_Harrison.html" title="Harry Harrison">Harry Harrison</a>'s <a href="/wiki/Stainless_Steel_Rat.html" title="Stainless Steel Rat">Stainless Steel Rat</a> series; the name "Moist" could be read as a nod to "Slippery Jim". Like von Lipwig, diGriz is a genius con man pulled unwillingly (at first) into service by his government. Each also has a similar well-defined morality regarding their choice of crime and targets; however, von Lipwig learns to his dismay in <i>Going Postal</i> that seemingly "victimless" crimes against faceless institutions nonetheless leave their own trail of victims.</p>

Mort is described as being very tall and skinny, with muscles like knots in string. He has a shock of bright red hair, and looks as if he is made entirely of knees. Mort starts off at the bottom, learning to accept his position while <a href="/wiki/Manure.html" title="Manure">mucking out</a> the <a href="/wiki/Stable.html" title="Stable">stables</a>, and trying to ignore <a  title="">Ysabell</a>, Death's <a href="/wiki/Adoption.html" title="Adoption">adopted</a> daughter. When Death feels in need of a break, Mort takes over <i>The Duty</i>. Unfortunately for Mort, his feelings for a <a href="/wiki/Minor_Discworld_characters#Princess_Keli.html" title="Minor Discworld characters">teenage princess</a> get in the way of his job and he starts off a chain reaction of events. Reluctant to tell his master he tries various methods to fix the situation, including the appointment of a <a href="/wiki/Wizard.html" title="Wizard">wizard</a> to help people recognise the queen.</p>
<p>After fighting and losing to Death, Mort was given an extra lease of life when the Grim Reaper turned over his Lifetimer. This allowed him to stay in the world of the living, but with one inevitable consequence: he would die when the number of years from that point onwards equalled the number of years that he had already lived. Afterwards, Mort leaves Death's service and marries Ysabell.

In general Mr Pin makes the plans and decides where they're going to go and what they're going to do, but he is open to suggestions from his partner. Both men can become violent, but Mr Tulip has a seemingly unlimited supply of violence, which was one of the main characteristics that attracted him to Mr Pin as a partner in crime.</p>

<h2>Mr Tulip</h2>
<p>Mr Tulip (other names unknown) is a character who features in the novel <i><a href="/wiki/The_Truth_%28novel%29.html" title="The Truth (novel)">The Truth</a></i>. Mr Tulip is something of a contradiction, at once a remorseless killer and an art lover. He is differentiated from a common criminal by his habit of removing priceless works of art from houses before committing arson, and he recognises great art works all over Ankh Morpork, being an instinctive connoisseur of the arts. He also suffers a mild speech impediment, causing him to often insert "—ing" mid-sentence. His speech impediment may, in fact, be a joke referring to both a certain popular curseword and censorship, especially seeing as how it is mentioned in the book that he simply says "ing" without adding any previous verbs to it.</p>
<p>One major problem with Mr Tulip is not that he has a drugs habit as such, but that he <i>wants</i> to have a drug habit, having a tendency to desire anything sold in little bags. Unfortunately for this desire, in a city where on any street any number of Discworld drugs are available, he would unerringly find the one man who was selling oven cleaner or calcium carbonate. His primary skill in the New Firm (himself and <a href="/wiki/Minor_Discworld_characters#Mr_Pin.html" title="Minor Discworld characters">Mr Pin</a>) is his literally unlimited supply of anger. He has in fact turned mindless violence into an art form.</p>
<p>He is the sidekick of Mr Pin, and though an instinctive killer, recognises Mr Pin's cognitive skills, and leaves the thinking to him.

Earlier in the book she is mentioned as being capable of believing the Disc is under threat from inhuman monsters, since she already believes that the world is round, it does you good to have a laugh, and that three <a href="/wiki/Dwarfs_%28Discworld%29.html" title="Dwarfs (Discworld)">dwarfs</a> look in on her undressing.

She makes her entrance as a stunningly attractive woman with long black hair, eccentric mannerisms and seemingly unlimited wealth. Myria, in fact, turned out to be the first of <a href="/wiki/Discworld_gods#The_Auditors_of_Reality.html" title="Discworld gods">The Auditors</a> to inhabit a human body for the purposes of manipulating <a href="/wiki/Jeremy_Clockson.html" title="Jeremy Clockson">Jeremy Clockson</a> to stop Time, and to gain an understanding of humans.</p>
<p>She initially gave a distinct impression of being inhuman despite her looks, but as time passed she not only learned to be a better mimic, but began to be lured into humanity.

Forming an unlikely alliance with <a href="/wiki/Susan_Sto_Helit.html" title="Susan Sto Helit">Susan Sto Helit</a> and <a href="/wiki/Lu-Tze.html" title="Lu-Tze">Lu-Tze</a>, she contributed her knowledge of her former 'race' to the trio.

She reported that the sensory stimulation from eating a piece of toast almost killed her, so it remains unclear if she drowned, or if the taste of all that chocolate did her in. Afterward, she was met by <a href="/wiki/Death_%28Discworld%29.html" title="Death (Discworld)">Death</a>, indicating that she had become a genuine person.</p>

As Patrician, he used his power to enforce <a href="/wiki/Laws.html" title="Laws">laws</a> against creative exaggeration in writing. For example, no <a href="/wiki/Bard.html" title="Bard">bard</a> was allowed to say of a hero that "all men spoke of his prowess" on pain of death; he should instead add that some people spoke ill of the hero and that still others did not know of him at all. Similarly, the phrase "her face launched a thousand ships" could only be used to describe a beautiful woman if relevant shipyard records were produced or, failing that, evidence that the woman's face resembled a <a href="/wiki/Champagne_%28beverage%29.html" title="Champagne (beverage)">champagne</a> bottle.</p>
<p>As far as <a href="/wiki/Standardization.html" title="Standardization">standardization</a> was concerned, Quimby instituted the <a href="/wiki/Ankh-Morpork.html" title="Ankh-Morpork">Ankh-Morpork</a> Bureau of Measurements, in which is kept the standardized Blunt Stick (originally a Sharp one was on display as well, but very few things were found worse than a poke in the eye with it), the recipe for the Pie that It May be As Nice As, Two Short Planks and the stone used in the original Moss-Gathering Trials. This Bureau is maintained by the current Patrician, Lord <a href="/wiki/Havelock_Vetinari.html" title="Havelock Vetinari">Havelock Vetinari</a>, on the grounds that the sort of people whose minds work like this ought to be kept busy, or they might do <i>anything</i>.</p>
<p>Quimby's reign ended when he was killed by a disgruntled poet during an experiment to test the truth of the saying "The pen is mightier than the sword". In his memory, it was amended to read: "The pen is mightier than the sword only if the sword is very small and the pen is very sharp".</p>

<h2>Otto Chriek</h2>
<p>Otto is one of the "Black Ribboners", vampire "<a href="/wiki/Teetotaller.html" title="Teetotaller">teetotallers</a>" who have forsworn drinking human "b-vord". Due to the supernatural nature of their "addiction", Black Ribboners must replace their craving for blood with something else; in Otto's case, he has become obsessed with light and photography. Since very bright light reduces vampires to dust until someone administers a drop of blood, the flash salamander he uses constantly causes Otto problems. He now carries a small vial of blood on a chain around his neck, which smashes and reconstitutes him if his salamander goes off too brightly. Otto experiments with "dark light", the light you find when you go out the other side of darkness, but this has its own unique problems, such as not necessarily illuminating the present to the imp inside his camera (which paints the pictures he takes). Most other people also object to being photographed with it, out of beliefs of it being "Unholy" or simply being uncomfortable with feeling "like your head has been opened up and icicles have been pounded into your brain", as <a href="/wiki/Minor_Discworld_characters#William_de_Worde.html" title="Minor Discworld characters">William de Worde</a> puts it.</p>
<p>Otto maintains a ridiculous and overly stereotypical vampire appearance (with a few concessions to his art) as opposed to the downplaying of these aspects that most Black Ribboners go for. By ensuring people find him funny, he is able to ensure they do not find him threatening.</p>
<p>Chriek's character would seem to be inspired by the news photographer "<a href="/wiki/Weegee.html" title="Weegee">Weegee</a>", who was also known for his distinctive accent, self-taught skills, knack for appearing at the scene of a crime and flair for self-promotion, although not so much for any tendency to dissolve into dust.</p>

<h2>Victor Tugelbend</h2>
<p>Student wizard turned actor, and protagonist of <a href="/wiki/Moving_Pictures_%28novel%29.html" title="Moving Pictures (novel)"><i>Moving Pictures</i></a>. Victor's uncle left a legacy to pay for Victor's tuition at Unseen University, provided that Victor never scored below an 80 on an exam. Victor, however, decided that being a student wizard was greatly preferable to being a wizard, because as a student he could live a relatively safe and comfortable lifestyle. Therefore, Victor studied extremely hard and, when finals came around each year, carefully and competently scored an 84 -- four points above the minimum to continue receiving the legacy, but four points below the passing grade of 88. Eventually this caught the attention of the <a href="/wiki/The_Bursar.html" title="The Bursar">Bursar</a>, who arranged for Victor to receive a special test consisting of only one question: "What is your name?" By this time, however, Victor had left Unseen University to become an actor in Holy Wood, under the stage name Victor Maraschino. He films several movies with Ginger Withel (aka Delores De Syn), and eventually uses the magic of Holy Wood to defeat the Things from the <a href="/wiki/Dungeon_Dimensions.html" title="Dungeon Dimensions">Dungeon Dimensions</a> with Ginger's help. Victor has not reappeared in any subsequent Discworld books.</p>
<p>Victor is also notable for being <i>actively</i> lazy; he kept himself fit because it was less effort to do things with decent muscles, and put a lot of work into avoiding work (as his University career illustrates). He was looking for a job that was romantic, but did not involve hard work, which Holy Wood provided.</p>

After his 'death', his senses are quite enhanced from their 130-year-old state although his appearance is somewhat unsettling, mostly from a failed attempt at preventing rotting via an advanced form of biofeedback (basically, controlling the reactions of your organs voluntarily). After numerous attempts to take his own life...or after-life...he joined a band of undead misfits and eventually helped to defend the city of <a href="/wiki/Ankh-Morpork.html" title="Ankh-Morpork">Ankh-Morpork</a> against the additional lifeforce on the <a href="/wiki/Discworld_%28world%29.html" title="Discworld (world)">Discworld</a>.

He murdered his sister Elsa for being a Yennork (a werewolf who cannot shapeshift), and presumably would have done the same to his brother Andrei, also a Yennork, had he not escaped. He is his mother's favourite over Angua, whom she views with disgust for trying to be human, though it is hinted that his mother is also afraid of him. That said, he is afraid somewhat of Angua, partly because she is a better fighter than him.</p>
<p>Wolfgang, unlike the rest of his family, remains naked when in his human form, seeing it as natural beauty. He continues the families bloodsport of chasing humans through the woods, known as "The Game" though unlike the rest he does not abide by its rules (eg. the humans don't actually have to take part). Though Angua tells Carrot that he's not stupid, she later accuses him of not being smart enough to mastermind the Dwarf plot by himself (ie. his mother helped him).
