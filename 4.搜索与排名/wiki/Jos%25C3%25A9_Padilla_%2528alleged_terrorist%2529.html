<h2>Arrest</h2>

On his return, he was arrested by federal agents at <a href="/wiki/Chicago%2C_Illinois.html" title="Chicago, Illinois">Chicago</a>'s <a href="/wiki/O%27Hare_International_Airport.html" title="O'Hare International Airport">O'Hare International Airport</a> on <a href="/wiki/May_8.html" title="May 8">May 8</a>, <a href="/wiki/2002.html" title="2002">2002</a>, and held as a material witness on a warrant issued in the state of <a href="/wiki/New_York.html" title="New York">New York</a> stemming from the <a href="/wiki/September_11%2C_2001_attacks.html" title="September 11, 2001 attacks">September 11, 2001 attacks</a>.</p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/June_9.html" title="June 9">June 9</a>, <a href="/wiki/2002.html" title="2002">2002</a>, two days before District Court Judge Michael Mukasey was to issue a ruling on the validity of continuing to hold Padilla under the material witness warrant, President Bush issued an order to Secretary Rumsfeld to detain Padilla as an "enemy combatant," and Padilla was transferred to a military brig in South Carolina without any notice to his attorney or family. The order legally justified the detention by leaning on the AUMF<sup id="_ref-aumf_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[2]</a></sup>, which authorized the President to "use all necessary force against . . . such nations, organizations, or <i>persons</i>" and by opining that a U.S. citizen detained on U.S. soil can be classified an enemy combatant. (This opinion is based on the decision of the United States Supreme Court in the case of <i><a href="/wiki/Ex_parte_Quirin.html" title="Ex parte Quirin">ex parte Quirin</a></i>, a case involving the detention of a group of German-Americans working for Nazi Germany).<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a  title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>According to the text of the ensuing decision from the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, President Bush's order for Padilla's detention as an "enemy combatant" was for these reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>Padilla was "closely associated with al Qaeda, an international terrorist organization with which the United States is at war";</li>
<li>he had engaged in "war-like acts, including conduct in preparation for acts of international terrorism";</li>
<li>he had intelligence that could assist the United States in warding off future terrorist attacks; and</li>
<li>he was a continuing threat to American security.</li>
</ol>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: The Legal Battle over Habeas Corpus">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="The_Legal_Battle_over_Habeas_Corpus" id="The_Legal_Battle_over_Habeas_Corpus"></a></p>
<h2>The Legal Battle over <i>Habeas Corpus</i></h2>
<p>Because Padilla was being detained without any criminal charges being formally made against him, he, through his lawyer, made a petition for a writ of <i><a href="/wiki/Habeas_corpus.html" title="Habeas corpus">habeas corpus</a></i> to the District Court for the Southern District of New York, naming Secretary Donald Rumsfeld as the respondent to this petition. The government filed a motion to dismiss the petition on the grounds that 1) Padilla's lawyer was not a proper "<a href="/wiki/Next_friend.html" title="Next friend">Next Friend</a>" to sign and file the petition on Padilla's behalf, 2) Commander Marr of the South Carolina brig, and not U.S. Secretary Rumsfeld, should have been named as the respondent to the petition, and 3) the New York court lacked personal jurisdiction over the named respondent Secretary Rumsfeld who resides in Virginia. The New York District Court disagreed with the government's arguments and dismissed its motion. However, the court further declared that President Bush had constitutional and statutory authority to designate and detain American citizens as "enemy combatants" and that Padilla was entitled to challenge his "enemy combatant" designation and detention in the course of his <i>habeas corpus</i> petition. Since the New York District Court had in some way disappointed all sides of this legal battle, both Padilla and the government made an interlocutory appeal to the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.</p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/December_18.html" title="December 18">December 18</a>, <a href="/wiki/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a>, the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Court_of_Appeals_for_the_Second_Circuit.html" title="United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit">U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals</a> declared that</p>
<ol>
<li>Padilla's lawyer is a proper "Next Friend" to sign and file the <i>habeas corpus</i> petition on Padilla's behalf because she, as a member of the bar, had a professional duty to defend her client's interests. Further, she had a significant attorney-client relationship with Padilla and far from being some zealous "intruder" or "uninvited meddler".</li>
<li>Secretary Rumsfeld can be named as the respondent to Padilla's <i>habeas corpus</i> petition, even though it is South Carolina's Commander Marr who had immediate physical custody of Padilla, because there have been past cases where national-level officials have been named as respondents to such petitions.</li>
<li>The New York District Court had personal jurisdiction over Secretary Rumsfeld even though Rumsfeld resides in Virginia and not New York because New York's "long arm statute" is applicable to Secretary Rumsfeld, who was responsible for Padilla's physical transfer from New York to South Carolina.</li>
<li>Despite the legal precedent set by <i><b>ex parte Quirin</b></i>, "the President lacked inherent constitutional authority as Commander-in-Chief to detain American citizens on American soil outside a zone of combat". The 2nd Circuit Court relied on the case of <i><b>Youngstown Sheet &amp; Tube Co. v. Sawyer</b></i> (343 U.S. 579), where the U.S. Supreme Court had ruled that President Truman, during the Korean War years, could not use his position and power as Commander-in-Chief, created under Article 2, Section 2 of the U.S. Constitution, to seize the nation's steel mills on the eve of a nation-wide steelworkers' strike. The extraordinary government power to curb civil rights and liberties during crisis periods, such as times of war, lies with Congress and not the President. Article 1, Section 9, Clause 2 of the U.S. Constitution grants Congress, and not the President, with the power to suspend the right of <i>habeas corpus</i> during a period of rebellion or invasion.</li>
</ol>
<p>Without clear Congressional approval (per 18 U.S.C. § 4001(a)), President Bush cannot detain an American citizen as an "illegal enemy combatant" and the court ordered that Padilla be released from the military brig within 30 days<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a  title="">[4]</a></sup>. However, the court had stayed the release order pending the government's appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.</p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/February_20.html" title="February 20">February 20</a>, <a href="/wiki/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States.html" title="Supreme Court of the United States">Supreme Court</a> agreed to hear the government's appeal. The Supreme Court heard the case, <i><a href="/wiki/Rumsfeld_v._Padilla.html" title="Rumsfeld v. Padilla">Rumsfeld v. Padilla</a></i>, in <a href="/wiki/April_2004.html" title="April 2004">April 2004</a>, but on <a href="/wiki/June_28.html" title="June 28">June 28</a>, <a href="/wiki/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>, the court dismissed the petition on technical grounds<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a  title="">[5]</a></sup>: First, it was improperly filed in federal court in New York instead of South Carolina, where Padilla was actually being detained. Second, the Court held that the petition was incorrect in naming the Secretary of Defense as the respondent instead the Commanding Officer of the naval brig who was Padilla's actual custodian for <i>habeas corpus</i> purposes.</p>
<p>The case was refiled and a decision in Padilla's favor was issued in the Federal District Court for South Carolina. On <a href="/wiki/June_13.html" title="June 13">June 13</a>, <a href="/wiki/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>, the <a href="/wiki/U.S._Supreme_Court.html" title="U.S. Supreme Court">U.S. Supreme Court</a> denied the government's petition to have his case heard directly by the court, instead of the appeal being first heard by the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Court_of_Appeals_for_the_Fourth_Circuit.html" title="United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit">4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals</a> in <a href="/wiki/Richmond%2C_Virginia.html" title="Richmond, Virginia">Richmond, Virginia</a>.</p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/September_9.html" title="September 9">September 9</a>, <a href="/wiki/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>, a three-judge panel of the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that President Bush does indeed have the authority to detain Padilla without charges, in an opinion written by judge <a href="/wiki/J._Michael_Luttig.html" title="J. Michael Luttig">J. Michael Luttig</a>. In the ruling, Luttig cited the joint resolution by Congress authorizing military action following the <a href="/wiki/September_11%2C_2001_attacks.html" title="September 11, 2001 attacks">September 11, 2001 attacks</a>, attacks in New York City, as well as the <a href="/wiki/June_2004.html" title="June 2004">June 2004</a> ruling concerning <a href="/wiki/Yaser_Hamdi.html" title="Yaser Hamdi">Yaser Hamdi</a>. Attorneys for Padilla, plus a host of civil liberties organizations, blasted the detention as illegal. They said it could lead to the military holding anyone, from protesters to people who check out what the government considers the wrong books from the library. The Bush Administration denied the allegations.</p>
<p>But as the Congressional military authorization <sup id="_ref-aumf_1" class="reference"><a  title="">[2]</a></sup> pertained only to nations, organizations or persons whom the President "determines planned, authorized, committed, or aided the <a href="/wiki/September_11%2C_2001_attacks.html" title="September 11, 2001 attacks">September 11, 2001 attacks</a>, or harbored such organizations or persons", others argue that this kind of Congressional limitation to the military power would assure an appropriately narrow range of detainees and the power to detain would last only so long as the Congressional authorization was not revoked or remained in effect by its terms. Also the <a href="/wiki/Yaser_Hamdi.html" title="Yaser Hamdi">Yaser Hamdi</a> Supreme Court case (<i><a href="/wiki/Hamdi_v._Rumsfeld.html" title="Hamdi v. Rumsfeld">Hamdi v. Rumsfeld</a></i>) upon which the court relied requires a <a href="/wiki/Habeas_corpus.html" title="Habeas corpus">habeas corpus</a> hearing for any alleged enemy combatant who demands one, claiming not to be such a combatant, which would also place additional judicial or perhaps military tribunal oversight over each such detention.</p>

<h2>The Indictment: <i>Habeas Corpus</i> Satisfied?</h2>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/November_22.html" title="November 22">November 22</a>, <a href="/wiki/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>, CNN's front page broke the news that Padilla had finally been indicted on charges he "conspired to murder, kidnap and maim people overseas." <sup><a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cnn.com/2005/LAW/11/22/padilla.case/index.html">[3]</a></sup> Many news sources correlated the indictment's timing as avoidance of an impending Supreme Court hearing on the Padilla case: "the administration is seeking to avoid a Supreme Court showdown over the issue". <sup><a  class="external autonumber" title="http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory?id=1340398">[4]</a></sup> <sup><a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.heraldnewsdaily.com/stories/news-00103612.html">[5]</a></sup> <sup><a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ocregister.com/ocregister/news/homepage/article_852377.php">[6]</a></sup> None of the original allegations put forward by the U.S. government three years ago, the claims that held Padilla in the majority in solitary confinement throughout that period, were part of the indictment: "<a href="/wiki/United_States_Attorney_General.html" title="United States Attorney General">Attorney General</a> <a href="/wiki/Alberto_Gonzales.html" title="Alberto Gonzales">Alberto Gonzales</a> announced Padilla is being removed from military custody and charged with a series of crimes" and "There is no mention in the indictment of Padilla's alleged plot to use a dirty bomb in the United States. There is also no mention that Padilla ever planned to stage any attacks inside the country. And there is no direct mention of Al-Qaeda. Instead the indictment lays out a case involving five men who helped raise money and recruit volunteers in the 1990s to go overseas to countries including <a href="/wiki/Chechnya.html" title="Chechnya">Chechnya</a>, <a href="/wiki/Bosnia_and_Herzegovina.html" title="Bosnia and Herzegovina">Bosnia</a>, <a href="/wiki/Somalia.html" title="Somalia">Somalia</a> and <a href="/wiki/Kosovo.html" title="Kosovo">Kosovo</a>. Padilla, in fact, appears to play a minor role in the conspiracy.

<h2>Padilla and speculation about the Oklahoma City bombing</h2>
<p>Following Padilla's arrest, several media outlets pointed to a resemblance between Padilla and police sketches of an <a href="/wiki/Oklahoma_City_Bombing.html" title="Oklahoma City Bombing">Oklahoma City Bombing</a> suspect known as "John Doe No. 2," although no investigation has connected him with that event. However, some commentators, such as talk radio host <a href="/wiki/Glenn_Beck.html" title="Glenn Beck">Glenn Beck</a>, continue to subscribe to the theory Padilla was "John Doe No. 2" and that he was involved with the plot at Oklahoma City. <sup><a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.glennbeck.com/news/06132002.shtml">[21]</a></sup></p>
<p>A related <a href="/wiki/Conspiracy_theory.html" title="Conspiracy theory">conspiracy theory</a> claims he was likely a CIA agent and that the fact he is being held as an enemy combatant is part of a cover up of his involvement in the Oklahoma City bombings while a CIA agent. <sup><a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.whatreallyhappened.com/padillaJD2.html">[22]</a></sup></p>
