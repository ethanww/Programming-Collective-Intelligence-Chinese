<p><a name="Common_features" id="Common_features"></a></p>
<h2>Common features</h2>
<p>Though MMORPGs have evolved considerably, many of them share some basic characteristics.</p>
<ul>
<li>Traditional <a href="/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons.html" title="Dungeons &amp; Dragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a> style gameplay, including <a href="/wiki/Quest_%28gaming%29.html" title="Quest (gaming)">quests</a>, <a href="/wiki/Mob_%28computer_gaming%29.html" title="Mob (computer gaming)">monsters</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Looting_%28gaming%29.html" title="Looting (gaming)">loot</a>.</li>
<li>A system for character development, usually involving levels and <a href="/wiki/Experience_points.html" title="Experience points">experience points</a>.</li>
<li>An economy, based on the trade of items such as weapons and armor, and a regular currency.</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Clan_%28computer_gaming%29.html" title="Clan (computer gaming)">Guilds or clans</a>, which are organizations of players, whether or not the game actively supports them.</li>
<li>Game Moderators or Game Masters (frequently abbreviated to GM) are sometimes paid individuals in charge of supervising the world.</li>
</ul>
<p>As most MMORPGs are commercial, such as <a href="/wiki/EverQuest.html" title="EverQuest">EverQuest</a> and <a href="/wiki/World_of_Warcraft.html" title="World of Warcraft">World of Warcraft</a>, players must either purchase the client software for a one-time fee or pay a monthly subscription to play. Most major MMORPGs require players to do both. By nature, "massive multiplayer" games are online, and require monthly subscriptions to support design and development. The alternate term MMGS (Massive Multiplayer Gaming Service) is also appropriate for describing <a href="/wiki/MMOG.html" title="MMOG">MMOGs</a> in general and MMORPGs in particular.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: History">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="History" id="History"></a></p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>MMORPGs, as defined today, have existed since the early 1990s. However, their history extends to the late 1970s.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: The first gameworlds">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="The_first_gameworlds" id="The_first_gameworlds"></a></p>
<h3>The first gameworlds</h3>
<p>The beginning of the MMORPG genre can be traced to text-based (entirely non-graphical) Multi-User Domains, or <a href="/wiki/MUD.html" title="MUD">MUDs</a>, with the first being developed by <a href="/wiki/Richard_Bartle.html" title="Richard Bartle">Richard Bartle</a> and <a href="/wiki/Roy_Trubshaw.html" title="Roy Trubshaw">Roy Trubshaw</a> in 1978. These games ran on private servers, usually at a university, and sometimes without the knowledge of the system's administrators. Players would typically connect to the games using a <a href="/wiki/TELNET.html" title="TELNET">TELNET</a> client, and gameplay was similar to <a href="/wiki/Role-playing_game.html" title="Role-playing game">role-playing games</a> such as <i><a href="/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons.html" title="Dungeons &amp; Dragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></i>. By typing commands into a parser, players would enter a dungeon, fight monsters, gain experience, and acquire loot.</p>
<p>Similar games quickly surfaced during that period for the <a href="/wiki/PLATO.html" title="PLATO">PLATO</a> System. MUDs (and later their descendants such as <a href="/wiki/MUSH.html" title="MUSH">MUSHes</a> and <a href="/wiki/MOO.html" title="MOO">MOOs</a>) were sometimes wildly different from one another, but shared many basic interface elements. An example of this would be a player's means of navigating his or her character around the gameworld by typing in compass directions ("n", "se", etc.).</p>
<p>Many MUDs are still active, with and a number of influential MMORPG designers, such as <a href="/wiki/Raph_Koster.html" title="Raph Koster">Raph Koster</a>, <a href="/wiki/Brad_McQuaid.html" title="Brad McQuaid">Brad McQuaid</a>, <a href="/wiki/Mark_Jacobs_%28video_game_designer%29.html" title="Mark Jacobs (video game designer)">Mark Jacobs</a>, <a href="/wiki/Brian_Green_%28game_developer%29.html" title="Brian Green (game developer)">Brian "Psychochild" Green</a> and <a  class="new" title="Damion Schubert">Damion Schubert</a>, began as MUD developers and/or players.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Early commercial development">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Early_commercial_development" id="Early_commercial_development"></a></p>
<h3>Early commercial development</h3>
<p>The first commercial MMORPG (although what constitutes "massive" requires some when discussing mid-1980s <a href="/wiki/Mainframe_computer.html" title="Mainframe computer">mainframes</a>) was <i><a href="/wiki/Islands_of_Kesmai.html" title="Islands of Kesmai">Islands of Kesmai</a></i> designed by <a href="/wiki/Kelton_Flinn.html" title="Kelton Flinn">Kelton Flinn</a> and John Taylor. Still text-based (or, more accurately, <a href="/wiki/Roguelike.html" title="Roguelike">roguelike</a>), this game became available to consumers in <a href="/wiki/1984.html" title="1984">1984</a> for $12.00 per hour via the <a href="/wiki/CompuServe.html" title="CompuServe">CompuServe</a> online service.</p>
<p>The first graphical character-based interactive environment, though not actually an RPG, was <i><a href="/wiki/Club_Caribe.html" title="Club Caribe">Club Caribe</a></i>. Although first released as <i><a href="/wiki/Habitat_%28video_game%29.html" title="Habitat (video game)">Habitat</a></i>) in 1988, Club Caribe was introduced by <a href="/wiki/LucasArts.html" title="LucasArts">LucasArts</a> for <a href="/wiki/Quantum_Link.html" title="Quantum Link">Q-Link</a> customers on their <a href="/wiki/Commodore_64.html" title="Commodore 64">Commodore 64</a> computers. Users could interact with one another, chat and exchange items. Although very basic, its use of online <a href="/wiki/Avatar.html" title="Avatar">avatars</a> (already well established off-line by <a href="/wiki/Ultima.html" title="Ultima">Ultima</a> and other games) and combining <a href="/wiki/Chat.html" title="Chat">chat</a> and graphics was revolutionary for the time.</p>

<i>Neverwinter Nights</i> on AOL, the first graphical MMORPG.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The first graphical MMORPG was <i><a href="/wiki/Neverwinter_Nights_%28AOL_game%29.html" title="Neverwinter Nights (AOL game)">Neverwinter Nights</a></i> by designer <a href="/wiki/Don_Daglow.html" title="Don Daglow">Don Daglow</a> and programmer <a href="/wiki/Cathryn_Mataga.html" title="Cathryn Mataga">Cathryn Mataga</a>. "Neverwinter Nights" went live on AOL for <a href="/wiki/Personal_computer.html" title="Personal computer">PC</a> owners in 1991 and ran through 1997. This project was personally championed and green-lighted by AOL President <a href="/wiki/Steve_Case.html" title="Steve Case">Steve Case</a>. Both <i>Club Caribe</i> and <i>Neverwinter Nights</i> cost $6.00 per hour to play.</p>
<p>During the early-<a href="/wiki/1990s.html" title="1990s">1990s</a>, commercial use of the internet was limited by <a href="/wiki/NSFNET.html" title="NSFNET">NSFNET</a> acceptable use policies. Consequently, early online games like <i><a href="/wiki/Legends_of_Future_Past.html" title="Legends of Future Past">Legends of Future Past</a></i>, <i>Neverwinter Nights</i>, <i><a href="/wiki/GemStone_IV.html" title="GemStone IV">GemStone III</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Dragon%27s_Gate.html" title="Dragon's Gate">Dragon's Gate</a></i>, and <i><a href="/wiki/Federation_II.html" title="Federation II">Federation II</a></i> relied heavily on proprietary services such as CompuServe, <a href="/wiki/America_Online.html" title="America Online">America Online</a>, and <a href="/wiki/GEnie.html" title="GEnie">GEnie</a> for distribution.</p>
<p>Following <i>Neverwinter Nights</i> was <i><a href="/wiki/The_Shadow_of_Yserbius.html" title="The Shadow of Yserbius">The Shadow of Yserbius</a></i>, a MMORPG on <a href="/wiki/The_Sierra_Network.html" title="The Sierra Network">The Sierra Network</a> (TSN), which ran from 1992 through 1996. The game was produced by <a href="/wiki/Joe_Ybarra.html" title="Joe Ybarra">Joe Ybarra</a>. <i>The Shadow of Yserbius</i> was an hourly service, although it also offered unlimited service for $119.99 per month, until <a href="/wiki/AT%26T.html" title="AT&amp;T">AT&amp;T</a> acquired TSN and rendered it strictly an hourly service. The name was then changed from TSN to the <a href="/wiki/ImagiNation_Network.html" title="ImagiNation Network">ImagiNation Network</a>.</p>
<p>As <a href="/wiki/NSFNET.html" title="NSFNET">NSFNET</a> restrictions were relaxed, traditional game companies and online services began deploying games on the <a href="/wiki/Internet.html" title="Internet">internet</a>. The first commercial text-based MMORPG to make this transition to the Internet from a proprietary network provider (CompuServe, in this case) was <i><a href="/wiki/Legends_of_Future_Past.html" title="Legends of Future Past">Legends of Future Past</a></i>, designed by <a  class="new" title="Jon Radoff">Jon Radoff</a> and Angela Bull. Also notable were its professional <a href="/wiki/Game_Master.html" title="Game Master">Game Masters</a> who conducted online events. This is now a common feature. The game was offered over the Internet for $3.60 per hour in 1992 and ran until 2000.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: World-wide MMORPGs">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="World-wide_MMORPGs" id="World-wide_MMORPGs"></a></p>
<h3>World-wide MMORPGs</h3>
<p>Access to the Internet, forming a global playerbase, caused game companies to grow in popularity and accumulate truly <i>massive</i> numbers. As a result, many players found themselves interacting with strangers from different countries and cultures for the first time. With this global access to paying customers, there also came a surge in profitability for game companies.</p>
<p><i><a href="/wiki/Meridian_59.html" title="Meridian 59">Meridian 59</a></i>, launched by <a href="/wiki/The_3DO_Company.html" title="The 3DO Company">3DO</a> in late 1996, was one of the first modern MMORPGs. It was the first Internet game from a major publisher, the first to be covered in the major game magazines, and the first to introduce the flat monthly subscription fee. Most significantly, however, and another first for online RPGs, was its <a href="/wiki/Game_engine.html" title="Game engine">3D engine</a>, allowing players to experience the game world through the eyes of their characters. A cult following quickly grew for <i>Meridian 59</i> that still exists today.</p>
<p><i><a href="/wiki/The_Realm_Online.html" title="The Realm Online">The Realm Online</a></i>, another successful early Internet MMORPG was launched by <a href="/wiki/Sierra_Entertainment.html" title="Sierra Entertainment">Sierra Online</a>. Although released just after <i>Meridian 59</i>, the <a href="/wiki/Development_stage.html" title="Development stage">beta</a> was active several months before. <i>The Realm Online</i> had fully animated 2D graphics, both in and out of combat situations. This made it far more accessible to a wider audience compared to the less appealing graphical MUDs on which it was based. Also, its gameplay and interface were already familiar to those accustomed to the graphical adventure games earlier popularised by Sierra. Like its predecessors, <i>The Realm Online</i> still had simple turn-based combat, and a basic user interface. It, too, is still popular.</p>
<p><i><a href="/wiki/Ultima_Online.html" title="Ultima Online">Ultima Online</a></i>, released in September 1997, is now credited with popularizing the genre. It featured 3D <a href="/wiki/Isometric.html" title="Isometric">isometric</a>/third-person graphics, and was set in the already popular <i>Ultima</i> universe. It was also a more involved, complex game than many of its predecessors.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, commercial online gaming was becoming extraordinarily popular in <a href="/wiki/South_Korea.html" title="South Korea">South Korea</a>. <i><a  title="Nexus: The Kingdom of the Winds">Nexus: The Kingdom of the Winds</a></i>, designed by <a href="/wiki/Jake_Song.html" title="Jake Song">Jake Song</a>, was commercially released in 1996 and eventually gained over one million subscribers. Song's next game, <i><a href="/wiki/Lineage_%28computer_game%29.html" title="Lineage (computer game)">Lineage</a></i> (<a href="/wiki/1998.html" title="1998">1998</a>), enjoyed even greater success gaining millions of subscribers in Korea and <a href="/wiki/Taiwan.html" title="Taiwan">Taiwan</a>. This helped to secure developer <a href="/wiki/NCsoft.html" title="NCsoft">NCsoft</a>'s dominance in the global MMORPG market for several years.</p>

It was the most commercially successful MMORPG in the <a href="/wiki/United_States.html" title="United States">United States</a> for five years, and was the basis for eleven expansions (as of March 2006) and several <a href="/wiki/EverQuest_universe.html" title="EverQuest universe">derivative games</a>. <i><a href="/wiki/TIME.html" title="TIME">TIME</a></i> magazine and other non-gaming media featured stories on <i>EverQuest</i>, often focusing on the controversies and social questions spawned by its popularity.<sup title="The text in the vicinity of this tag needs citation." class="noprint">[<a  title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><i>citation&#160;needed</i></a>]</sup> In 1999, after the releases of <i>Ultima Online</i> and <i>EverQuest</i> was another hit, <i><a href="/wiki/Asheron%27s_Call.html" title="Asheron's Call">Asheron's Call</a></i>. Together, these three games are sometimes referred as the original "big three" of the late 1990s.</p>

<h3>MMORPGs in the new millennium</h3>
<p>By the turn of the century, game companies were eager to capitalize on the new market, which had seemingly limitless potential. The concept of <a href="/wiki/Massively_multiplayer_online_game.html" title="Massively multiplayer online game">massively multiplayer online games</a> expanded into new <a href="/wiki/Video_game_genre.html" title="Video game genre">video game genres</a> around this time, though RPGs, with their ability to "suck in" the player, were (and are) still the most financially promising.</p>
<p>The next generation of MMORPGs, following the "big three" of the previous decade, was to include the medieval <a href="/wiki/Player_versus_player.html" title="Player versus player">PvP</a>-oriented <i><a href="/wiki/Dark_Age_of_Camelot.html" title="Dark Age of Camelot">Dark Age of Camelot</a></i>, the sci-fi <i><a href="/wiki/Anarchy_Online.html" title="Anarchy Online">Anarchy Online</a></i>, and <i>Ultima Online 2</i>, along with two or three others which either never were completed or failed to capture significant market share.<sup title="The text in the vicinity of this tag needs citation." class="noprint">[<a  title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><i>citation&#160;needed</i></a>]</sup> <i>Anarchy</i> released first in June 2001, but immediately had crippling technical problems, mostly due to an inability to handle the huge playerbase. <i>Camelot</i> launched smoothly four months later, introducing "Realm vs. Realm" <a href="/wiki/Player_versus_player.html" title="Player versus player">PvP</a> and other innovations, but still never attained the media attention or fame garnered by the previous "big three", which were still running strongly. <i>Ultima Online 2</i>, while greatly anticipated by its community, was cancelled when <a href="/wiki/Electronic_Arts.html" title="Electronic Arts">Electronic Arts</a> decided that it would be more profitable to instead concentrate on the first <i>Ultima Online</i>. Growth of the 'big three' nearly plateaued, and some began to believe that the market had possibly been saturated.</p>
<p>Of course, developers didn't stop trying, and dozens of MMORPGs continued to be produced.</p>

<i><a href="/wiki/Final_Fantasy_XI.html" title="Final Fantasy XI">Final Fantasy XI</a></i> The first MMO to allow console and PC gamers to play together</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>In 2002, <i><a href="/wiki/Final_Fantasy_XI.html" title="Final Fantasy XI">Final Fantasy XI</a></i> was released, which hoped to bring in fans of the extremely popular (but mostly single-player) <i><a href="/wiki/Final_Fantasy.html" title="Final Fantasy">Final Fantasy</a></i> series, which was particularly popular in Japan. Like the previous <i>Final Fantasy</i> games, this one was playable on a console, using a handheld controller, but bore little resemblance to gameplay in prior Final Fantasy titles. Though not the first console MMORPG (this was probably <a href="/wiki/Phantasy_Star_Online.html" title="Phantasy Star Online">Phantasy Star Online</a>, for the <a href="/wiki/Dreamcast.html" title="Dreamcast">Dreamcast</a>), <i>FFXI</i> was the first online game capable of supporting both console and PC users simultaneously(except for the private servers of phantasy star online; on this server dreamcast- and pc players could play together, later also gamecube and xbox players of the phantasy star online games). It was also notable for randomly selecting servers for new player-characters (instead of letting players pick for themselves), a practice which was highly criticized, but resulted (intentionally<sup title="The text in the vicinity of this tag needs citation." class="noprint">[<a  title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><i>citation&#160;needed</i></a>]</sup>) in game worlds in which players would regularly interact and play the game with both English and Japanese. <i>Final Fantasy XI</i> still persists as one of the leading MMORPGs on the market to date.</p>
<p>Also released in 2002 was the sprite-based <i><a href="/wiki/Ragnarok_Online.html" title="Ragnarok Online">Ragnarok Online</a></i>, produced by Korean company <a href="/wiki/Gravity_Corp..html" title="Gravity Corp.">Gravity Corp.</a>. Unbeknownst to many Western players, the game took Asia by storm, as <i>Lineage</i> had done. Gravity once claimed that there were 17 million subscribers of the game, though this number may not be entirely reliable.</p>
<p>May 2003 saw the release of <i><a href="/wiki/Eve_Online.html" title="Eve Online">Eve Online</a></i>, produced by <a href="/wiki/Crowd_Control_Productions.html" title="Crowd Control Productions">Crowd Control Productions</a>, which had players taking the role of spaceship pilots and had gameplay similar to the cult series <a href="/wiki/Star_Control.html" title="Star Control">Star Control</a>. Though not the first space MMORPG ("Earth and Beyond" was released in September 2002), <i>Eve</i> was able to achieve lasting success. One of the reasons for its success must have been the game's design, in which very few objects are actually modelled on the screen at any given time (often the player is alone in space, or fighting targets too far away to see). This allowed the game to perform well even with only one unsharded universe.]</p>
<p>In October 2003, <i><a href="/wiki/Lineage_II.html" title="Lineage II">Lineage II</a></i> (NCsoft's sequel to <i>Lineage</i>) became the latest MMORPG to achieve huge success across Asia. It received the Presidential Award at the 2003 Korean Game awards, and is now the second most popular MMORPG in the world. As of the first half of 2005 Lineage II counted over 2.25 million subscribers worldwide, with servers in Japan, China, North America, Taiwan, and Europe, once the popularity of the game had surged in the West. However, the last "chronicle" or major installment for the game, Chronicle 5, went live on August 1, 2006. Game officials have announced that there will be no further chronicles for the game, fueling speculation about the sequel, Lineage III.</p>

<i>World of WarCraft</i> is the most widely played game in North America, and one of the most popular MMORPG's to date. A raid group of horde-factioned players can be seen here on their mounts.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The most recent generation of MMORPGs, based on standards of graphics, gameplay, and popularity, is said to have launched in April 2004 with NCSoft's <i><a href="/wiki/City_of_Heroes.html" title="City of Heroes">City of Heroes</a></i>, which was based on a comic-book <a href="/wiki/Superhero.html" title="Superhero">superhero</a> theme instead of the usual fantasy or science-fiction. This was followed in November 2004, with <a href="/wiki/Sony_Online_Entertainment.html" title="Sony Online Entertainment">Sony Online Entertainment</a>'s <i><a href="/wiki/EverQuest_II.html" title="EverQuest II">EverQuest II</a></i> and <a href="/wiki/Blizzard_Entertainment.html" title="Blizzard Entertainment">Blizzard Entertainment</a>'s <i><a href="/wiki/World_of_Warcraft.html" title="World of Warcraft">World of Warcraft</a></i>. At the time, Sony expected to dominate the market, based on the success of the first <i>Everquest</i>, and decided to offer a flat monthly rate to play all of their MMORPGs including <i>EverQuest</i>, <i>EverQuest II</i>, and <i><a href="/wiki/Star_Wars_Galaxies.html" title="Star Wars Galaxies">Star Wars Galaxies</a></i>, to keep from competing with itself. However, <i>World of Warcraft</i> immediately overtook all of these games upon release, and indeed became so popular that it dwarfed all previous monthly-fee MMORPGs. At present, <a href="/wiki/World_of_Warcraft.html" title="World of Warcraft">WoW</a> is one of the most played games in North America, and the most played American MMORPG, with a total of over 6 million customers worldwide. With the release of these newer games, subscriptions began to decline for many older MMORPGs, even the year-old <i><a href="/wiki/Lineage_II.html" title="Lineage II">Lineage II</a></i>, and in particular <i>Everquest 1</i>. The current MMORPG market has World of Warcraft in a position similar to the position of <a href="/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons.html" title="Dungeons &amp; Dragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a> in the tabletop RPG market, with both games' market share being greater than 50% of the overall market.</p>
<p>In April 2005, <i><a href="/wiki/Guild_Wars.html" title="Guild Wars">Guild Wars</a></i> launched successfully, introducing a new financial model which might have been partly responsible for its success. Though definitely an online RPG, and technically having a persistent world (despite most of the game's content being <a href="/wiki/Instanced.html" title="Instanced">instanced</a>), it required only a one-time purchasing fee. It was also designed to be "winnable", more or less, as developers wouldn't profit from customers' prolongued playtime. Other differences compared to traditional MMORPGs included strictly PvP-only areas, a relatively short playtime requirement to access end-game content, and instant world travel. For these differences it was termed instead a "Competitive/Cooperative Online Role-Playing Game" (<a href="/wiki/CORPG.html" title="CORPG">CORPG</a>) by its developers, and is now seen by some as occupying a new niche in the MMORPG market.</p>
<p>Finally, despite WoW's domination in the pay-MMORPG market, there still has been significant competition (and potential for profit) among free MMORPGs. A good example of a potentially profitable free MMORPG is the Korean <i><a href="/wiki/MapleStory.html" title="MapleStory">MapleStory</a></i>, a <a href="/wiki/Side-scroller.html" title="Side-scroller">side-scroller</a> developed by <a href="/wiki/Wizet.html" title="Wizet">Wizet</a>, which features purchasable game "enhancements". Due to its free nature, the game is said to have more than 30 million players in all of its many versions, with the majority of them from East Asia.</p>

Another researcher is Nick Yee who has surveyed more than 35,000 MMORPG players over the past few years, focusing on psychological and sociological aspects of these games. His research can be found at <a  class="external text" title="http://www.nickyee.com/daedalus">The Daedalus Project</a>.

</div>
<p>Many small teams of programmers and artists have tried to create their own MMORPGs. The average MMORPG project takes three to four years and large investments of money to create. Independent development, or game development not run by any company, usually takes longer due to lack of developer's time, manpower or money. Additionally, the long-term lack of funding required for running MMORPG servers may lead to the abandonment of the project.</p>
<p>However, many smaller developers are producing games with pay to play graphics, gameplay and features. Only time will tell if these games can afford to run.</p>
<p>Sometimes these independent games are free-to-play, but will confer in-game privileges to paying customers.</p>

<h2>Browser-based MMORPGs</h2>
<p>With the success of the MMORPG genre in recent years, several multiplayer games played in <a href="/wiki/Web_browser.html" title="Web browser">web browsers</a> have also begun using the MMORPG moniker. This largely text-based sub-genre developed from old <a href="/wiki/Bulletin_board_system.html" title="Bulletin board system">BBS</a> games and pre-dates the modern idea of an MMORPG. Browser-based MMORPGs are usually simpler games than their stand-alone counterparts, typically involving turn-based play and simple strategies (e.g. "build a large army, then attack other players for gold"), though there are many interesting variations on the popular themes to be found. Many of these games are more like <a href="/wiki/Turn-based_MMORPG.html" title="Turn-based MMORPG">turn-based</a> <a href="/wiki/Strategy_game.html" title="Strategy game">strategy games</a> or <a href="/wiki/Wargame.html" title="Wargame">wargames</a> than <a href="/wiki/Role-playing_game.html" title="Role-playing game">role-playing games</a>. In <i><a href="/wiki/Planetarion.html" title="Planetarion">Planetarion</a></i> players control planets and fleets of ships; in <i><a href="/wiki/Kings_of_Chaos.html" title="Kings of Chaos">Kings of Chaos</a></i> the player commands an army rather than a single <a href="/wiki/Player_character.html" title="Player character">player character</a>. In <i><a href="/wiki/Pardus_%28game%29.html" title="Pardus (game)">Pardus</a></i>, the player controls a character who owns a spaceship and gains experience points through trading or fighting, in a way similar to the classic game <i><a href="/wiki/Elite_%28computer_game%29.html" title="Elite (computer game)">Elite</a></i>. In <i><a href="/wiki/BattleMaster.html" title="BattleMaster">BattleMaster</a></i>, the game world never "resets", so that some player realms have existed for more than 5 real years while other realms be formed and destroyed by players, virtually giving the game its own developing history as lived and written all by the players.

<p>One of the earliest examples of a browser-based MMORPG is <i><a href="/wiki/Archmage_%28computer_game%29.html" title="Archmage (computer game)">Archmage</a></i>, which dates back to early <a href="/wiki/1999.html" title="1999">1999</a>. Currently, a popular browser-based MMORPG, <i>Kings of Chaos</i>, boasts a player population numbering in the hundreds of thousands. Its popularity is primarily fuelled by a reciprocal link clicking system where users give each other more soldiers by clicking on their friends' unique links, taking advantage of the <a href="/wiki/Small_world_phenomenon.html" title="Small world phenomenon">small world phenomenon</a> to spread word of the game across the world. Some examples of click based MMORPG's are <i><a href="/wiki/Legend_of_the_Green_Dragon.html" title="Legend of the Green Dragon">Legend of the Green Dragon</a></i> and <i><a  class="new" title="World of Phaos">World of Phaos</a></i>, whose code is <a href="/wiki/Open_source.html" title="Open source">open source</a>, allowing anyone to create their own game <a href="/wiki/Server_%28computing%29.html" title="Server (computing)">server</a>. Another browser-based MMORPG, <i><a href="/wiki/Kingdom_of_Loathing.html" title="Kingdom of Loathing">Kingdom of Loathing</a></i>, is entirely <a href="/wiki/Satire.html" title="Satire">satirical</a>. Some of the more popular of these have become profitable through user subscriptions.</p>
<p>Not all browser-based MMORPGs are <a href="/wiki/Turn-based_MMORPG.html" title="Turn-based MMORPG">turn-based text games</a>. More recently, faster computers and the <a href="/wiki/Java_platform.html" title="Java platform">Java</a> programming language have allowed the introduction of graphical browser-based MMORPGs such as <i><a href="/wiki/RuneScape.html" title="RuneScape">RuneScape</a></i>, produced by <i><a href="/wiki/Jagex.html" title="Jagex">Jagex</a></i>, which are more similar to standalone MMORPGs.</p>
<p>In addition, Macromedia's introduction of Shockwave 3D and the MUS Multiuser Server in 2001 makes it possible to create 3D browser-based MMORPGs based on the Shockwave plug-in.</p>

<p><a name="Genre_challenges" id="Genre_challenges"></a></p>
<h2>Genre challenges</h2>
<p>By their nature, MMORPGs require significant resources for both development and maintenance.</p>
<p>To create a large virtual game-space, one needs to employ artists to design a large number of areas (and possibly creatures, characters, weapons, spaceships...) and also a team of programmers to turn those designs into a digital "reality". A new modern MMORPG would also require innovative game design, and a large number of 3D models and animations.</p>
<p>MMORPGs must also include reliable systems for a number of vital tasks. The program must be able to handle and verify a large number of connections; prevent cheating; and apply changes (bug fixes or added content) to the game. A system for recording the game's data at regular intervals, without stopping the game, is also a plus.</p>
<p>Maintenance requires sufficient <a href="/wiki/Server_%28computing%29.html" title="Server (computing)">servers</a> and <a href="/wiki/Bandwidth.html" title="Bandwidth">bandwidth</a>, and a dedicated support staff. Insufficient resources for maintenance lead to <a href="/wiki/Lag.html" title="Lag">lag</a> and frustration for the players, and can severely damage the reputation of a game, especially at launch. Care must also be taken to ensure that player population remains at an acceptable level by adding or removing servers ("shards"). <a href="/wiki/Peer-to-peer.html" title="Peer-to-peer">Peer-to-peer</a> MMORPGs could theoretically work cheaply and efficiently in regulating server load, but practical issues such as asymmetrical network bandwidth and CPU-hungry rendering engines make them a difficult proposition. Additionally, they would probably become vulnerable to other problems including new possibilities for <a href="/wiki/Cheating_in_online_games.html" title="Cheating in online games">cheating</a>.</p>

<h2>Cheating in online games</h2>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>Cheating is a major challenge for game developers and legitimate players. <a href="/wiki/Exploit_%28online_gaming%29.html" title="Exploit (online gaming)">Exploiting</a> is a form of cheating involving the use of a flaw in the game mechanics to gain unfair advantage. Depending on the nature of the exploit, developers can address the exploits within a short time through patches and updates. Even when fixed, exploiting can still be an issue, as exploiters may still have the advantage or items they gained before the patch was released. Depending on the nature of the exploit, a rollback may be needed just to counter the effects. <a href="/wiki/Twinking.html" title="Twinking">Twinking</a> may also be seen as another form of cheating.</p>
<p>Third-party programs may be used to automate in-game actions, often with such efficiency that it gives users a huge advantage. <a href="/wiki/Internet_bot.html" title="Internet bot">Botting</a> is a term for a player using a script that could automate progress through the game without them actually playing the game. <a href="/wiki/Farmer_%28gaming%29.html" title="Farmer (gaming)">Farmers</a>, if they are unable to use exploits, will use such methods to harvest ingame currency or materials from the game world around the clock. They often sell the currency and items they earn via <a href="/wiki/EBay.html" title="EBay">eBay</a> or other commerce sites, thus further unbalancing the game's economy. This gives players a chance to make their way into the upper tiers of the system without following the logic originally intended by the designers.</p>
<p>Some third party programs are released with code in them to <a href="/wiki/Keystroke_logging.html" title="Keystroke logging">capture</a> and relay account details back to the author, enabling them to steal virtual possessions from the account or impersonate the rightful owner to perpetrate <a href="/wiki/Cheating_in_online_games.html" title="Cheating in online games">confidence tricks</a> and other scams. These are often packaged, <a href="/wiki/Trojan_horse_%28computing%29.html" title="Trojan horse (computing)">trojan</a>-like, with seemingly-innocuous software tools for easier distribution amongst unsuspecting users.</p>
<p>Even more subtle methods are known to be used to cheat; depending on the way the game handles certain aspects of gameplay the client can be modified, either on disk, directly in memory, or on the wire as data passes between the client and server. So far as the server does not verify the veracity of client data or, ideally, take care of important calculations server-side, this can be used to modify values such as character health or armour, speed up movement, or change other aspects of the game to the cheater's advantage. There are programs that have been designed to prevent external programs from running during a game, such as <a href="/wiki/GameGuard.html" title="GameGuard">GameGuard</a>. The integrity of client files can also be checked each time the game is loaded, although of course there are usually methods to bypass or disable these protection programs.</p>

<p><a name="Private_servers" id="Private_servers"></a></p>
<h2>Private servers</h2>
<p>Single-client based graphic MMORPGs may have private servers or <a href="/wiki/Server_emulator.html" title="Server emulator">server emulators</a>. Private servers are mostly run by volunteers, therefore most of them are free. However, some private servers may wish for people to donate money, sometimes in exchange for a bonus in the game. Private servers remain markedly less popular than the official servers, with player numbers usually in the hundreds, though popular private servers may reach up to one or two thousand online players and even up to ten thousand in terms of player registrations. <i><a href="/wiki/EQEmu.html" title="EQEmu">EQEmu</a></i> is a server emulator for <i><a href="/wiki/EverQuest.html" title="EverQuest">EverQuest</a></i>, others exist for <i><a href="/wiki/World_of_Warcraft.html" title="World of Warcraft">World of Warcraft</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Lineage_II.html" title="Lineage II">Lineage II</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Ultima_Online.html" title="Ultima Online">Ultima Online</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Ragnarok_Online.html" title="Ragnarok Online">Ragnarok Online</a></i>, and many other MMORPGs.</p>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/People%27s_Republic_of_China.html" title="People's Republic of China">China</a> as well as many other Asian countries the use of private servers is more prevalent. Most Chinese MMORPG players are aware of the existence of private servers. The reasons for this are the relatively high fees for official servers and the availability of 100MB/s fiber optic internet connections, which can be as cheap as US$30 a month. As a result, the costs of running a server in China are remarkably low. In one instance, a private server had more than 50 000 players registered. Some even have 1000 accounts in 1 day (the opening day). Among such cases are <i>Mu Online</i> which is one of the most popular private server games in the world, with thousands of private servers. Private servers have significantly damaged the commercial MMORPG development. Many gamers in China feel the companies that developed MMORPGs purposefully made the leveling progress advance slowly so more money could be made off the gamers. Most of the private servers have placed a faster experience rate, allowing players to progress through the game faster than on retail servers, though there are often a variety of in-game bugs present that are not prevalent in official servers.</p>

<h2>Current trends in MMORPGs</h2>
<p>As the MMORPG market becomes more competitive, innovation in new releases is becoming a necessity; it would be financial suicide to release another simple <a href="/wiki/Hack_and_slash.html" title="Hack and slash">hack and slash</a> MMORPG, no matter how pretty it looked. So, MMORPGs, as long as they are being produced, will be continuously evolving.</p>
<p>One (arguable) MMORPG trend is "tie-ins" with successful movie licenses. The most recent example of this is <i><a href="/wiki/The_Matrix_Online.html" title="The Matrix Online">The Matrix Online</a></i>, based on the Matrix trilogy of films; the earliest possibly was <i><a href="/wiki/Star_Wars_Galaxies.html" title="Star Wars Galaxies">Star Wars Galaxies</a></i>. Though neither of these titles was a great financial success, mainly due to their divergence from the original property and poor gameplay, further tie-in games will very likely still be produced. This process is also apparently being applied in reverse, with <a href="/wiki/James_Cameron.html" title="James Cameron">James Cameron</a> designing a MMORPG that will <i>precede</i> the movie (<i><a href="/wiki/Project_880.html" title="Project 880">Project 880</a></i>) it is tied to. <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/06_07/b3971073.htm">[1]</a></p>
<p>A controversial trend which merits much greater discussion is the trading of real currency for game currency, sometimes supported by the game providers.</p>
<p>One near-future trend could be the introduction of player-created content into the games. Some <a href="/wiki/MMOG.html" title="MMOG">MMOGs</a> already rely heavily on player created content, from animations to complete buildings with player-created textures and architecture - examples include <a href="/wiki/Second_Life.html" title="Second Life">Second Life</a> and the noncombat RPG <a href="/wiki/A_Tale_in_the_Desert.html" title="A Tale in the Desert">A Tale in the Desert</a>. However, these games are very different from the far more popular "standard" MMORPGs revolving around combat and limited character tradeskills. Player-created content in these games would be in the form of areas to explore, missions to carry out and specific weapons and armor to use (see one planned expansion here: <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ryzom-ring.com">[2]</a>). Whether or not this becomes mainstream is anyone's guess. Some games in development, such as <a href="/wiki/Trials_of_Ascension.html" title="Trials of Ascension">Trials of Ascension</a> are making player-created content a major aspect of the game.</p>
<p>Also possible in the near future is the widespread introduction of MMOG software engines, which are generic tools that make it much easier for individuals (or small teams) to produce their own MMOGs (including MMORPGs) for profit. Some examples of this kind of engine are <a  class="new" title="Multiverse (Software engine)">Multiverse</a>, <a href="/wiki/Kaneva.html" title="Kaneva">Kaneva</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Realm_Crafter.html" title="Realm Crafter">Realm Crafter</a>. The engine <a  class="new" title="First Star online">First Star online</a> was released in 2001 but did not gain widespread popularity.</p>
<p>Some predict<sup title="The text in the vicinity of this tag needs citation." class="noprint">[<a  title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><i>citation&#160;needed</i></a>]</sup> that a new rush of independent MMOG development, spurred on by these new software engines, will result in successful "<a href="/wiki/Mod_%28computer_gaming%29.html" title="Mod (computer gaming)">mods</a>" for MMORPGs, similar to what has happened with the <a href="/wiki/First-person_shooter.html" title="First-person shooter">FPS</a> genre (see <a href="/wiki/Counter-Strike.html" title="Counter-Strike">Counter-Strike</a>).</p>
