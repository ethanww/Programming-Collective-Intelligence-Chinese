<p><b>Non-native pronunciations of English</b> result from the common linguistic phenomenon in which non-native users of any language tend to carry the <a href="/wiki/Intonation.html" title="Intonation">intonation</a>, <a href="/wiki/Phonology.html" title="Phonology">phonological</a> processes, and <a href="/wiki/Pronunciation.html" title="Pronunciation">pronunciation</a> rules from their mother tongue into their English speech. They may also create innovative pronunciations for English sounds not found in the speaker's first language.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Grammar.html" title="Grammar">Grammar</a> differences (for example the lack or surplus of <a href="/wiki/Grammatical_tense.html" title="Grammatical tense">tense</a>, <a href="/wiki/Grammatical_number.html" title="Grammatical number">number</a>, <a href="/wiki/Grammatical_gender.html" title="Grammatical gender">gender</a> etc.) in different <a href="/wiki/Languages.html" title="Languages">languages</a> often lead to grammatical mistakes that are telltale signs of their native language. Sometimes non-verbal <a href="/wiki/Body_language.html" title="Body language">body language</a>, <a href="/wiki/Facial_expression.html" title="Facial expression">facial expressions</a>, or other cues also give away the origin of the speaker.</p>
<p>Another factor is how the English language is taught as a second language. In such cases, the accent of the teachers will affect the accent of the students. In some places that were formerly under <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom.html" title="United Kingdom">British</a> rule, such as <a href="/wiki/India.html" title="India">India</a>, <a href="/wiki/Hong_Kong.html" title="Hong Kong">Hong Kong</a> and <a href="/wiki/Malaysia.html" title="Malaysia">Malaysia</a>, the English language remains a mandatory subject in most schools. Students study the English language at schools while using their native language in daily life. Thus, there may be distinctive features of pronunciation in those speakers.</p>

<li>Difficulty distinguishing between <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/w/</span> and <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/v/</span> because the former does not exist in these languages.</li>
<li>Dental fricatives are typically replaced by apical stops.</li>
<li>Difficulty with English diphthongs. May pronounce each vowel as distinct.</li>
<li>Difficulty with gender pronouns, because personal pronouns may be used for normally gender-neutral inanimate objects as well (like in English) but with a different gender than in English.

<li>Difficulty with articles such as "a" and "the" as they do not exist in Štokavian languages; the closest approximations are <a href="/wiki/Demonstrative.html" title="Demonstrative">demonstrative</a> adjectives like "some" or "one" and "that".</li>

<li>Overuse of definite articles, especially in phrases whose Bulgarian equivalents require articles, like "the Bulgarians usually..." instead of "Bulgarians usually..."</li>
<li>Pronunciation of English <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/h/</span>as the velar fricative <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[x]</span> (as in Spanish <b>J</b>ose).</li>

<li>Difficulty with verb tenses and plurals in general, as they have no direct equivalence in Chinese grammar.</li>
<li>Speakers may have difficulty with pronoun gender: (<i>he</i>, <i>she</i>, and <i>it</i>) since spoken Chinese does not make gender distinction in pronouns (although these words have different <a href="/wiki/H%C3%A0nz%C3%AC.html" title="Hànzì">hànzì</a>).</li>

<li>Difficulty in distinguishing between <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/v/</span> and <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/w/</span> since the latter does not appear in Czech phoneme inventory.</li>
<li>Prevalent misconception of 'oo' as representing a <a href="/wiki/Vowel_length.html" title="Vowel length">long vowel</a> where it should be short (thus rhyming words as "book", "hook" and "foot" with "loot" instead of "put").

<li>Some trouble with the dental fricatives <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/ð/</span> and <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/θ/</span>, which may be rendered either as <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[d]</span> and <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[t]</span> or <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[z]</span> and <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[s]</span> respectively.</li>

<h2><a href="/wiki/Finnish_language.html" title="Finnish language">Finnish</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>An absence of the English tonal variation. In Finnish the intonation contour is typically falling, and there's no meaning-distinguishing variation at the sentence level. Thus, speakers often have difficulties producing the rising tone of a question. The tempo of general speech is usually slower, which is how Finns typically speak.</li>
<li>There may be an absence of the word "please". In Finnish, politeness generally comes from tone of speech and the use of <a href="/wiki/T-V_distinction.html" title="T-V distinction">formal pronouns</a>. The expression "ole/olkaa hyvä" (for "please") is generally used only in formal settings or when stressing a specific issue politely.</li>
<li>In Finland, the traditional teaching policy focuses on writing with correct spelling and grammar, but pronunciation or usage gets less attention. This may lead to pronunciations imitating the spellings, e.g. "font" pronounced as <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[font]</span>, unlike the native English <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[fɒnt]</span>/<span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[fɑnt]</span>, or "count" becomes <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[kount]</span> instead of <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[kaʊnt]</span>.</li>
<li>Voicing (p vs. b, etc.) is not phonemic in Finnish, and due to this, voiced consonants may be devoiced. This includes:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Variation of voicing inside a long word shows the problems, even if short words are correctly pronounced. For example, <i>bed</i>, <i>pet</i> and <i>bet</i> may be distinct, but <i>probably</i> becomes <i>propably</i> or even <i>propaply</i>.</li>
<li>Devoicing of <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/b/</span> into <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[p]</span>, or confusing them when they appear in the same word. This is because in native Finnish pronunciation, 'b' is often pronounced identically to 'p', e.g. both <i>baari</i> (<a href="/wiki/Bar_%28establishment%29.html" title="Bar (establishment)">bar</a>, pub) and <i>paari</i> (<a href="/wiki/Par.html" title="Par">par</a>) are pronounced <i>paari</i>. The mispronunciation <i>bubi</i> and <i>pupi</i>"pub" is found in Finnish.</li>
<li>Sometimes, <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/k/</span> and <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/g/</span> are both pronounced 'k', e.g. <i>inkredient</i>, where the "k" is a devoiced "g".</li>
<li>The English voiced sibilant <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/z/</span> becomes the unvoiced <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[s]</span>, e.g. <i>roses</i> <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">['rəυziːz]</span> becomes <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[rousiːs]</span>. When the spelling is 's', it is always pronounced 's'. When the spelling is 'z', attempts at voicing might be observed e.g. with <i>haze</i> vs. <i>hays</i>, but usually these are identical with the latter.</li>
<li>As in German, the letter 'z' is used to write <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/ts/</span> in the Finnish alphabet. This may carry over to English, especially word-initially so that <i>zealous</i> might be pronounced <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[tselos]</span>. It may also be pronounced <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[dʒelos]</span> since Finnish speakers may confuse <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/z/</span> with the voiced affricate <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[dʒ]</span>. This would make <i>zealous</i> and <i>jealous</i> indistinct.</li>
<li>Difficulty with both voiced <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/ð/</span> (as in <i>the</i> <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[ðə]</span>) and unvoiced <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/θ/</span> (as in <i>thin</i> <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[θɪn]</span>) dental fricatives. Usually the pronunciation is not a fricative, but more like a dental <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/t/</span> or <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/d/</span>. For example, <i>thick</i> might be pronounced <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[t̪ik]</span>. While those speaking with other foreign accents may do so, Finnish speakers do not typically replace dental fricatives with alveolar fricatives ('s' or 'z').</li>
<li>Difficulty distinguishing between voiced <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[ʒ]</span> and unvoiced <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[ʃ</span>] postalveolars, e.g. <i>pleasure</i> <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[pleʒɚ]</span> is pronounced with either <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[s]</span> or <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[ʃ]</span>. The affricate <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[dʒ]</span> as in "jump" typically becomes unvoiced i.e. <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[tʃ]</span>, or even alveolar [ts].</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>The sound <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[ʃ]</span> does not exist as a native phoneme in Finnish. While speakers typically have no trouble producing the sound, slip-ups may occur.</li>
<li>The Finnish set of vowels is extensive enough to contain the relevant English vowels, and results in little vowel confusion. However, of English pure vowels, Finnish recognizes only "<a href="/wiki/Tenseness.html" title="Tenseness">tense</a>" vowels <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[aː eː iː oː uː yː æː øː]</span>, but does not recognize lax vowels <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[ə ɜ ʌ ɒ ɑ ɪ ɔ ʊ]</span>. They are replaced by short "tense" vowels instead, thus there is no vowel quality contrast; in this respect, the Finnish accent works like <a href="/wiki/Australian_English.html" title="Australian English">Australian English</a>. Thus, we have <i>tick</i> as [tik] and <i>teak</i> as [tiːk], unlike in native English, where the former is a <a href="/wiki/Lax_vowel.html" title="Lax vowel">lax vowel</a> (Jeffers &amp; Lehiste 1979:140).</li>
<li>In Finnish, there is no <a href="/wiki/Vowel_reduction.html" title="Vowel reduction">vowel reduction</a> as there is in English. As a result, Finnish speakers put in non-reduced vowels in place of vowels that are typically reduced in native pronunciations. Examples:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>There is no schwa in Finnish; typically the rounded cardinal vowel <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[ø]</span> replaces it. The <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[ə]</span> and <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[ɜ]</span> may be transformed into <a href="/wiki/%C3%96.html" title="Ö">Ö</a> <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[ø]</span> or <a href="/wiki/%C3%84.html" title="Ä">Ä</a> <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[æ]</span>. The word "baker" might be <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[beikkør]</span> instead of <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[beikəɹ]</span>, or "bird" <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[bɜːd]</span> may become <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[bøːd]</span>.</li>
<li>Similarly, when there is an 'a' in spelling but a schwa <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[ə]</span> in pronunciation, it is pronounced <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[æ]</span>. The word "American" might be pronounced <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">['æmerikæn]</span> instead of <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[ə'merɪkən]</span>.</li>
<li>The back vowels<span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/ʌ/</span> and <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/ɑ/</span> (the <i>u</i> in 'cut' and the <i>ar</i> in 'cart') both merge into become the latter<span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[ɑ]</span>. They do contrast in length, so that "cut" <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[kʌt]</span> is pronounced <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[kɑt]</span> while "cart" <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[kɑːt]</span> remains as is. In contrast, <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[æ]</span> remains as is, as it is a different phoneme from the <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/ɑ/</span> in Finnish.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><a href="/wiki/Vowel_length.html" title="Vowel length">Vowel length</a> allophony is reproduced reliably, as the difference is phonemic in Finnish.</li>
<li>Finnish speakers never use the glottal stop <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[ʔ]</span> as an allophone of <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/t/</span> like many English speakers do.</li>
<li>The English "tense" and "lax" (i.e. vowels contrasted by <a href="/wiki/Quantity.html" title="Quantity">quantity</a> and <a href="/wiki/Advanced_tongue_root.html" title="Advanced tongue root">advanced tongue root</a>) are completely replaced with their respective <a href="/wiki/Quantity.html" title="Quantity">quantity</a>-contrasted vowels (short and long vowels), which differ only by length, not by quality like in English. E.g. "bit" is pronounced <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[bɪt]</span> by native speakers but Finns typically say <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[bit]</span>. Thus, the only difference between "bit" and "beat" is vowel length <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[biːt]</span></li>
<li>Aspiration does not exist in Finnish and it is not heard, i.e. "top" <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[t<sup>h</sup>op]</span> and "stop" <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[stop]</span> are differentiated only by the 's'. However, sometimes Finnish-speakers pronounce a <a href="/wiki/Gemination.html" title="Gemination">geminate</a> instead in the medial position. (<a href="/wiki/Finnish_phonetics.html" title="Finnish phonetics">Finnish phonetics</a> do not allow initial or final geminates.) Geminates might also be used incorrectly, due the "<a  class="new" title="Generic gemination">generic gemination</a>", e.g. <i>Inttöönet</i> <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">['inttøːnet]</span> instead of <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">['ɪntənet]</span>.</li>
<li>The English <a href="/wiki/Approximant.html" title="Approximant">approximant</a> R <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/ɹ/</span> is usually pronounced <a href="/wiki/Rolled_R.html" title="Rolled R">rolled</a> <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[r]</span> as in Finnish, or imitated in some innovative, but incorrect way, e.g. using a <a href="/wiki/Creaky_voice.html" title="Creaky voice">creaky voice</a> instead of actual <a href="/wiki/Rhoticity.html" title="Rhoticity">rhoticity</a>. However, many speakers are able to produce the English R.</li>
<li>The sounds V and W are both reduced to the Finnish approximant V <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[ʋ]</span>, which is something between them, i.e. a <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[v]</span> without any <a href="/wiki/Fricative.html" title="Fricative">fricative</a> quality.</li>
<li>Due to Finnish always stressing the first syllable, English words accented on other syllables are often stressed incorrectly, e.g. "vocabulary" is <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">['ʋokæbulæri]</span> instead of the correct <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[və'kæbjʊləri]</span>. This can produce confusion, especially with words like “record” where stress is contrastive.</li>
<li>In Finnish, there is only one pronoun for "he" and "she," and needing to remember to distinguish the two can cause slip-ups. There are also no articles like "the" and "a" and Finns may have difficulty remembering to include them when speaking.</li>

<h2><a href="/wiki/German_language.html" title="German language">German</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>German does not have <a href="/wiki/Dental_consonant.html" title="Dental consonant">dental</a> fricatives (<span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[θ]</span> and <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[ð]</span>). Speakers may pronounce them as <a href="/wiki/Labiodental.html" title="Labiodental">labiodental</a> fricatives, <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[f]</span> and <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[v]</span>, or <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[s]</span> and <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[z]</span>; the former is more likely with younger speakers.</li>
<li><span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/s/</span> is sometimes pronounced as <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[z]</span> or vice versa. <a href="/wiki/Standard_German.html" title="Standard German">Standard German</a> lacks initial <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[s]</span>; some dialects, however, such as Bavarian, have only <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[s]</span> and lack <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[z]</span> as a phoneme entirely.</li>
<li>Word-final voiced stops <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/b d g/</span> may be devoiced to sound like <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[p t k]</span>. This is usually the hardest to overcome.</li>
<li><span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[dʒ]</span> as in <b>j</b>am, may be devoiced (especially by speakers from southern Germany), being pronounced as <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[tʃ]</span>.</li>
<li>Since German adverbs are identical in form to adjectives, Germans often drop the ending <i>-ly</i> from English adverbs.</li>
<li>Lack of distinction between <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[æ]</span> and <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[ɛ]</span>: thus "man" and "men" are pronounced as the latter.</li>
<li>Speakers may not velarize <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/l/</span> in coda-positions as native speakers do (Jeffers &amp; Lehiste 1979:140).</li>
<li>The German <a href="/wiki/Rhotic_consonant.html" title="Rhotic consonant">rhotic consonant</a> varies from region to region so speakers from different areas will pronounce the English <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/ɹ/</span> differently:
<ul>
<li>Many German dialects, including most varieties of standard German, have a uvular <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[ʀ]</span>, <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[χ]</span>, or <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[ʁ]</span> as in French and Danish. This is pronounced at the back of the throat, and in the case of the last two, they may seem harsh or grating to native speakers of English.</li>
<li>German speakers may use an alveolar <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[r]</span> as in Italian or Scottish. The German metal rock band <a href="/wiki/Rammstein.html" title="Rammstein">Rammstein</a> can be heard to use this in their music.</li>
<li>Several German dialects are non-rhotic, this may carry over into a speaker's English pronunciation. In English, however, non-rhotic accents are found in most of England, the Southern Hemisphere (Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, etc.), Malta, most Caribbean islands, Singapore, Malaysia, as well as in Eastern North America (especially in costal regions), so this is less noticeable. Many German speakers also have a rhotic accent.</li>
<li>Some German dialects use the same <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[ɹ]</span> as native English speakers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>German speakers may pronounce <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/w/</span> as <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[v]</span>, and <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/v/</span> as <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[f]</span>. This is likely due to spelling pronunciation. However, Bavarian lacks <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/v/</span>, and Bavarians usually learn <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/w/</span> more easily than <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/v/</span>.</li>
<li>Because words with "qu" represents /kv/ in German spelling, speakers may mistakenly think that English is the same. Words like "quick" then sound like "kvick".</li>
<li>Inappropriate use of "he/she" pronouns for animals and inanimate objects. (German nouns have <a href="/wiki/Grammatical_gender.html" title="Grammatical gender">grammatical gender</a>, so a foot is a "he", a child an "it", and a newspaper a "she".)</li>
<li>Difficulty in correct stressing of syllables; in most German words, the first syllable is stressed. Exceptions include words beginning with <i>be-</i>, <i>ge-</i>, <i>er-</i>, <i>ver-</i>, <i>zer-</i>, <i>ent-</i>, (and a few other prefixes); compound adverbs with <i>her</i>, <i>hin</i>, <i>da</i>, or <i>wo</i>; and loanwords to German from other languages. The stress normally falls on the second syllable in the former two examples.</li>

Because of dominance by the <a href="/wiki/British_Empire.html" title="British Empire">British Empire</a> for so long (See <a href="/wiki/History_of_India.html" title="History of India">History of India</a>) English is a commonly spoken language in India, especially in administration and as a <a href="/wiki/Lingua_Franca.html" title="Lingua Franca">Lingua Franca</a>. Attempts at describing an "Indian" accent will naturally oversimplify variation that appears from one Indic language to another.</p>
<ul>
<li>Use of the present continuous/progressive ("-ing") rather than simple present: "He has a car" becomes "He is having a car."</li>
<li>The rhotics <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/ɻ/</span> or <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/ɽ/</span> may be used instead of English <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/ɹ/</span> (The former sound exists in some American dialects, though).</li>
<li>The English <a href="/wiki/Alveolar.html" title="Alveolar">alveolar</a> stops <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/t/</span> and <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/d/</span>, are likely to be perceived by many native <a href="/wiki/Indo-European_languages.html" title="Indo-European languages">Indic</a> and <a href="/wiki/Dravidian_languages.html" title="Dravidian languages">Dravidian</a> language speakers as the <a href="/wiki/Retroflex_consonant.html" title="Retroflex consonant">retroflex consonants</a> <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/ʈ/</span> and <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/ɖ/</span> respectively. <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/l/</span> may also be retroflex. This leads to the "hollow" pronunciation of English by many Asian Indians.</li>
<li>Dental fricatives may be pronounced as dental stops.</li>
<li>The use of the double-positive, "Yeah, right," which in colloquial native English is a flippant way of saying "No" but to an Indian speaker of English is merely a double affirmation of correctness</li>
<li>Possible incorrect <a href="/wiki/Aspiration_%28phonetics%29.html" title="Aspiration (phonetics)">aspiration</a>. Many Indic languages have distinct aspirated and plain pairs of consonants in addition to voicing; speakers may have difficulty with correctly identifying or producing allophones of <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/p t k/</span> when they are unaspirated.</li>
<li>Confusing 'p' and 'f' (among North Indians).</li>
<li>Difficulty with <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/v/</span>, <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/w/</span>, and (with native Bengali speakers) <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/b/</span>. <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/w/</span> is not a common phoneme in Indic languages and speakers may produce both as <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/v/</span>. <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/ʋ/</span>, a labiodental approximant, is another possibility.</li>
<li>Use of "isn't it?" in place of all other tag questions: "He is tall, isn't it?"</li>
<li>Vocabulary variations: "stay" or "sit" instead of "live" (in a particular place), "cabin" instead of "office", "sit with" for "have a meeting with".</li>
<li>Hindi speakers tend to translate more idiomatic or syntactically foreign phrases into English word-for-word; for example when someone says "बैठो, न?" that translates to "sit, no?" or "sit, न?". Another example would be the use of the word "only" where in Hindi one would say "मैने ही कीया" which would translate directly to "I only did it" where it should be "I did it."</li>

<h2><a href="/wiki/Italian_language.html" title="Italian language">Italian</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Pronunciation of past tenses such as <i>flipped</i> as two syllables instead of the native pronunciation "flipt".</li>
<li>Tendency to pronounce the English high lax vowels <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/ɪ/ /ʊ/</span> as <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[i] [u]</span> (ex: "fill" and "feel", "put" "poot" are homophones), since Italian doesn't have these vowels.</li>
<li>Tendency to pronounce <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/ŋ/</span> as <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[ŋg]</span> ("singer" rhymes with "finger") because Italian <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[ŋ]</span> is an allophone of <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/n/</span> before velar stops.</li>
<li>Tendency to pronounce <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/sl/ /sm/ /sn/</span> as <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[zl zm zn]</span>. In English, the second consonant would assimilate the voicelessness of 's' but in Italian the process is reversed and <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/s/</span> assimilates the voicing.</li>
<li>Tendency to pronounce <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[ʌ]</span> as <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[a]</span>, <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[ɛ]</span> or <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[ɔ]</span> so that "hut" may sound like "hat" or "hot", and "club" is typically pronounced as <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[klɛb]</span></li>
<li>Tendency to pronounce <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[ɒ]</span> (British English) as <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[ɔ]</span> ("cot" =&gt; "caught"). This is not as significant in North America since the two sounds have merged in many places (see <a href="/wiki/Phonological_history_of_the_low_back_vowels#Cot-caught_merger.html" title="Phonological history of the low back vowels"><i>Cot-caught merger</i></a>). However, while in North America the phoneme has <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[ɑ]</span> and <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[ɔ]</span> as allophones, in Italian it is always an <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[ɔ]</span>, except when speakers deliberately try to have an American accent, where an <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[a]</span> is often used.</li>
<li>Italian does not have dental fricatives:
<ul>
<li>Voiceless <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/θ/</span> may be replaced with a dental <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[t̪]</span>.</li>
<li>Voiced <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/ð/</span> may become a dental <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[d̪]</span>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Since <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/t/</span> and <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/d/</span> are typically pronounced as dental stops anyway, words like "there" and "dare" can become homophones.</li>
<li><span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/æ/</span> pronounced as <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[ɛ]</span>. This and the above three tendencies make many Italians unable to pronounce <i>death</i> and <i>that</i> differently.</li>
<li>Tendency to pronounce <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[p t k]</span> as unaspirated stops.</li>
<li>Schwa <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[ə]</span> does not exist in Italian and speakers may pronounce an 'i' or 'a' instead.</li>
<li>Due to the high prevalence of words ending in vowels in Italian, speakers may epenthesize vowels at the end of English words that end in consonants. This has led to the stereotype of Italian speakers adding an –a to every word ending in a consonant. In reality, this feature is more reminiscent of an occasional slip-up.</li>
<li>Tendency to pronounce words as they are spelled so that "aren't" is more like <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[a.rɛnt]</span>, "tomb" as <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[tɔmb]</span> and "chocolate" as <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[tʃɔ.ko.leit]</span>.</li>
<li>In the diphthongs <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[aɪ eɪ ɔɪ aʊ]</span> the second vowel is tense and lasts almost as long as the first. Sometimes they are pronounced as two syllables so that "toy" is <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[tɔ.iː]</span> and "cow" is <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[ka.uː]</span></li>
<li>English 'o' is a diphthong <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/oʊ/</span>. Italian speakers often pronounce it as <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/o/</span>.</li>
<li>Most Italian accents are rhotic, wherein 'r' is either a trill <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[r]</span> or a flap <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[ɾ]</span> and speakers may have difficulty learning the English <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/ɹ/</span>.</li>
<li>Italian doesn't have <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/h/</span> and speakers may not pronounce it.</li>
<li>Tendency to make double consonants <a href="/wiki/Gemination.html" title="Gemination">geminate</a>, e.g. the two <i>p</i>s in "happy" become a longer 'p' sound: This happens because geminate consonants are distinctive in Italian and, as mentioned above, Italian speakers tend to use spelling as a cue to pronunciation.</li>
<li>In Italian, the letter 'z' is used for the alveolar affricates <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[ʦ]</span> and <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[ʣ]</span>. While rare, it is possible for speakers to mistakenly carry this over to English pronunciation instead of <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[z]</span>.</li>

<ul>
<li>Tendency to confuse <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/l/</span> and <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/r/</span>, since they are indistinct in Japanese. Both are often pronounced as <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[ɺ]</span>.</li>
<li>In Japanese, there is no <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/f/</span>. However, before <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/u/</span>, <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/h/</span> becomes <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[ɸ]</span> and this sounds close to an <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/f/</span>. Speakers may have difficulty perceiving the difference between <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[fu]</span> and <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[hu]</span>.</li>
<li>Other than in front of <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/u/</span> Japanese speakers may produce <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[p]</span> instead of <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[f]</span>.</li>
<li>Japanese also lacks <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[v]</span>. Typically, <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[b]</span> and <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[w]</span> replace it (i.e. "<a href="/wiki/Video.html" title="Video">video</a>" becomes "bideo" or "wideo"). It is typically the former since <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/w/</span> is uncommon in Japanese.</li>
<li>Japanese has a largely consonant-vowel syllable structure (although there are some clusters that include prenasalized stops) and so both consonant clusters and words ending in consonants may have epenthetic vowels (usually <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[ɯ]</span>, although it can be <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[o]</span>" after <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/t/</span> or <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/d/</span>). Between voiceless consonants, these epenthetic vowels (and already existing vowels as well) may be voiceless.</li>
<li>May have trouble distinguishing 'm' and 'n' before <a href="/wiki/Bilabial_consonant.html" title="Bilabial consonant">bilabial consonants</a> (b, m, &amp; p)</li>
<li>Articles such as "the" and "a" are often dropped or used inappropriately.</li>
<li>Difficulty remembering to distinguish between singular and plural nouns.</li>
<li>There are a number of <a href="/wiki/Japanese_phonology.html" title="Japanese phonology">phonological</a> processes that Japanese speakers may transfer to English:
<ul>
<li>Alveolars become postalveolars in front of <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/i/</span> and <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/j/</span>.
<ul>
<li><span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/s/</span> becomes <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[ʃ]</span>. (Some well-educated speakers hypercorrect their speech and make most instances of <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[ʃ]</span> into <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[s]</span>.)</li>
<li><span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/t/</span> and <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/d/</span> become <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[tʃ]</span> and <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[dʒ]</span>.</li>
<li>The epenthetical vowel (mentioned above) after syllables ending in <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/tʃ/</span> and <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/dʒ/</span> is usually <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[i]</span>.</li>
<li><span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/h/</span> becomes like the German <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[ç]</span>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Alveolar stops become affricated in front of <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/u/</span>.
<ul>
<li><span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/t/</span> and <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/d/</span> become <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[ts]</span> and <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[dz]</span> or <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[z]</span>..</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Possibly due to the inappropriate use of the gemination mark or <i>sokuon</i> when transliterating, speakers may occasionally <a href="/wiki/Gemination.html" title="Gemination">geminate</a> consonants.</li>
<li>Difficulty pronouncing <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/w/</span> sound except before 'a'.</li>

<li>While both English and Mandarin distinguish between plain and aspirated stops rather than voicing, several allophones of English aspirated sounds are unaspirated and several allophones of plain stops are voiced.

<li>Several vowels present in English are absent from Nigerian languages. There is usually variation from region to region on what is used

<li>"Bird" (<span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[bɜːd]</span> in RP) is pronounced variably as <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[baːd]</span> or <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[beːd]</span>.

<li>The vowel <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/ʌ/</span> is replaced by <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[o]</span> or <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[e]</span>, so "cut" <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/kʌt/</span> is pronounced <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[kot]</span> or <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[ket]</span>, the latter being Eastern.</li>
<li>"O," which is a diphthong in most dialects of English (<span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[əʊ]</span> in RP, <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[ow]</span> in North American), is generally pronounced as <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[oː]</span>,</li>
<li>The diphthong <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[eɪ]</span> is typically pronounced as <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[eː]</span>.</li>

<li>Some native Yoruba speakers tend to put <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[h]</span> at the beginning of words that begin with a vowel.</li>
<li>Some native Hausa speakers pronounce <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/p/</span> as <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[f]</span>.</li>
<li>Some speakers replace <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/j/</span> with <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[dʒ]</span>, so "yet" is pronounced like "jet."</li>

<li>There is a syllabic rhythm to speech, and unstressed syllables are often pronounced distinctly.</li>
<li>Words from Nigerian languages are often injected into speech.</li>
<li>Questions are sometimes constructed as a statement followed by "sha" and a rising tone. Another way of constructing a question is to use "shebi" or "abi" as a marker at the beginning of the sentence.</li>
<li>The meanings of "no" and "yes" are reversed for negative questions relative to standard English ("Yes, I have no bananas"). People often say "I'm coming" as they go away, meaning they'll be back soon.</li>

<li>Since Persian has no <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/w/</span>, <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[v]</span> is commonly used instead.

<li>In Persian, /r/ is an alveolar trill in the initial position, a tap <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[ɾ]</span> intervocalically and a voiceless trill <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[r̥]</span> word-finally (Ladefoged &amp; Maddieson 1996:216).

<li>Speakers often lengthen the final vowel in long words while stressing the first syllable.</li>
<li>Persian does not have a <a href="/wiki/Vowel_reduction.html" title="Vowel reduction">vowel reduction</a> pattern like English does, and as a result speakers may have difficulty producing schwa.</li>
<li>Consonant clusters that Persian speakers find difficult may be separated by epenthetical vowels or simplified through deletion.

</li>
<li>Typically speech is non-rhotic (except Brazilian and some other dialects), having no <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/r/</span> in the coda.

<li>In Brazil, Depending on the speaker's region, alveolar stops <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/t/</span> and <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/d/</span> may be palatalized before <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/i/</span> so that they sound like <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[tʃ]</span> and <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[tʒ]</span> but affricate consonantal clusters (like in "trim") will be pronounced without affrication.</li>

<ul>
<li>Both <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/v/</span> and <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/b/</span> become <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[v]</span> or <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[β]</span> (depending on the speaker's region) unless in a word-initial position, where they are realized as <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[b]</span>.</li>

<li>Often a word beginning with <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[s]</span> + consonant will obtain an epenthetical vowel (typically <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[e]</span> or <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[ɛ]</span>) to make "sprite" sound more like "esprite". In Spanish, /s/ must immediately precede or follow a vowel (some speakers may hypercorrect themselves and say "stir" for "ester").</li>
<li>Occasional mispronunciation of final <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/m/</span> as <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[n]</span>, e.g. "welcome" -&gt; "welcon".

<li>Pronunciation of final <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/ŋ/</span>, especially before non-velar consonants, as <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[n]</span> (sing -&gt; seen), because <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[ŋ]</span> is an allophone of <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/n/</span> before velar stops.</li>
<li><span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/h/</span> is either pronounced as <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[x]</span> or dropped. The former is because the closest Spanish sound to <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[h]</span> in most dialects is <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[x]</span>; the latter because orthographic &lt;h&gt; is silent in Spanish.

<li>Some speakers have difficulty distinguishing between <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/l/</span> and <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/r/</span>. Most dialects are non-rhotic and the rhotic consonant for Swahili speakers is an alveolar flap</li>
<li>Stress is often placed on the penultimate syllable: newspaper is <i>news<b>pa</b>per</i>.</li>

<ul>
<li>Sing-songy intonation. Swedes often speak English with a <a href="/wiki/Swedish_language#Prosody.html" title="Swedish language">melodic intonation</a>, ending sentences on an up-note, much parodied (The <a href="/wiki/Swedish_Chef.html" title="Swedish Chef">Swedish Chef</a> from <i><a href="/wiki/The_Muppet_Show.html" title="The Muppet Show">The Muppet Show</a></i> is a well known example.)</li>
<li>Difficulty pronouncing dental fricatives. Usually a dental stop or labiodental fricative is substituted.</li>
<li>Swedish lacks a <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/z/</span>, it is often pronounced <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[s]</span>.</li>
<li>Swedish lacks a <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/w/</span>, it is often pronounced <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[v]</span>. Speakers may overcorrect and pronounce both <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/w/</span> and <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/v/</span> as <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[w]</span>.</li>
<li><span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/tʃ/</span> is often pronounced as <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[ʃ]</span>. This could be caused by a mix-up with Swedish <a href="/wiki/Orthography.html" title="Orthography">orthography</a>, where <i>ch</i> often has a sound more like English <i>sh</i>.</li>
<li><span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/dʒ/</span> as in jump is sometimes pronounced as <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[ʒ]</span> (plea<i>s</i>ure) or even <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[j]</span> (<i>y</i>ellow), (the latter could be caused by mix-up with Swedish <a href="/wiki/Orthography.html" title="Orthography">orthography</a>, where <i>j</i> has this sound).</li>
<li>Some difficulty in verb conjugations (e.g. "they is"). Swedish verbs do not inflect for person.</li>
<li>Different Swedish dialects have different realizations of /r/. They range from alveolar trills and flaps to uvular sounds and even retroflex fricatives.</li>
<li>The <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/ʃ/</span> sound when written as <b>ti</b> (as in na<i>ti</i>on) may be pronounced as <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[tʃ]</span>. This could be due to problems with orthography.</li>
<li>Diphthongs: <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/aɪ/</span> may become <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[aj]</span>, and <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/aʊ/</span> would become <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[av]</span>. The former may not be significant and the latter may be due to problems with orthography.</li>
<li>Words written with <b>rs</b>, <b>rt</b>, <b>rd</b>, <b>rn</b> and <b>rl</b> often turn to retroflex variants of the consonant following r.</li>
<li>Swedish does not have dental fricatives. Most commonly, <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/ð/</span> becomes <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[d]</span> ("though" sounds like "dough") and <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/θ/</span> becomes <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[s]</span> or <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[f]</span> ("think" sounds like "sink" or "fink").</li>

This is not too different from English</li>
<li>Some dialects have <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[kx]</span> instead of aspirated <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[k]</span>, hence some speakers use this sound.</li>

<li>Dialects that have an <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[æ]</span> phoneme (e.g. Basel, Zurich) usually use this to represent English <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[æ]</span>; others (e.g. Graubuenden) however use <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[ɛ]</span>, which can then create homophones.</li>
<li>Older speakers may use <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[œ]</span> instead of <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[ʌ]</span>; other speakers generally use a variant of <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[a]</span></li>

<li>Tagálog has only five vowels, so the many vowel sounds in English may be mapped to the nearest-sounding existing vowel. However, a number of English vowels appear as allophones or in unstressed positions and this may facilitate a speaker's ability to learn the vowels.</li>

<li>Tendency to epenthesize vowels when dealing with consonant clusters. (e.g., <i>sport</i> may become <i>is-port</i>).</li>
<li>Speakers may mix up "he," "she," and "it." Tagálog does not distinguish gender in pronouns.</li>
