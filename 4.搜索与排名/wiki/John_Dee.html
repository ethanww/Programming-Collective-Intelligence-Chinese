<h3>Early life</h3>
<p>Dee was born in <a  class="new" title="Tower Ward">Tower Ward</a>, <a href="/wiki/London.html" title="London">London</a> to a <a href="/wiki/Wales.html" title="Wales">Welsh</a> family, whose surname derived from the <a href="/wiki/Welsh_language.html" title="Welsh language">Welsh</a> <i>du</i> ("black"). His father Roland was a <a href="/wiki/Mercer.html" title="Mercer">mercer</a> and minor <a href="/wiki/Courtier.html" title="Courtier">courtier</a>. Dee attended the <a href="/wiki/Chelmsford.html" title="Chelmsford">Chelmsford</a> Chantry School (now <a href="/wiki/King_Edward_VI_Grammar_School_%28Chelmsford%29.html" title="King Edward VI Grammar School (Chelmsford)">King Edward VI Grammar School (Chelmsford)</a>), then – from 1543 to 1546 – <a href="/wiki/St_John%27s_College%2C_Cambridge.html" title="St John's College, Cambridge">St. John's College</a>, <a href="/wiki/University_of_Cambridge.html" title="University of Cambridge">Cambridge</a>. His great abilities were recognized, and he was made a founding fellow of <a href="/wiki/Trinity_College%2C_Cambridge.html" title="Trinity College, Cambridge">Trinity College</a>. In the late 1540s and early 1550s, he travelled in <a href="/wiki/Europe.html" title="Europe">Europe</a>, studying at <a href="/wiki/Katholieke_Universiteit_Leuven.html" title="Katholieke Universiteit Leuven">Leuven</a> and <a href="/wiki/Brussels.html" title="Brussels">Brussels</a> and lecturing in <a href="/wiki/Paris.html" title="Paris">Paris</a> on <a href="/wiki/Euclid.html" title="Euclid">Euclid</a>. He studied with <a href="/wiki/Gemma_Frisius.html" title="Gemma Frisius">Gemma Frisius</a> and became a close friend of the <a href="/wiki/Cartography.html" title="Cartography">cartographer</a> <a href="/wiki/Gerardus_Mercator.html" title="Gerardus Mercator">Gerardus Mercator</a>, returning to England with an important collection of mathematical and astronomical instruments. In 1552, he met <a href="/wiki/Gerolamo_Cardano.html" title="Gerolamo Cardano">Gerolamo Cardano</a> in <a href="/wiki/London.html" title="London">London</a>: during their acquaintance they investigated a <a href="/wiki/Perpetual_motion_machine.html" title="Perpetual motion machine">perpetual motion machine</a> as well as a gem purported to have magical properties.</p>
<p>Dee was offered a readership in mathematics at <a href="/wiki/Oxford_University.html" title="Oxford University">Oxford</a> in 1554, which he declined, citing English universities' emphasis on <a href="/wiki/Rhetoric.html" title="Rhetoric">rhetoric</a> and <a href="/wiki/Grammar.html" title="Grammar">grammar</a> (which, together with <a href="/wiki/Logic.html" title="Logic">logic</a>, formed the <a href="/wiki/Academia.html" title="Academia">academic</a> <i><a href="/wiki/Trivium.html" title="Trivium">trivium</a></i>) over <a href="/wiki/Philosophy.html" title="Philosophy">philosophy</a> and science (the more advanced <i><a href="/wiki/Quadrivium.html" title="Quadrivium">quadrivium</a></i>, comprised of <a href="/wiki/Arithmetic.html" title="Arithmetic">arithmetic</a>, <a href="/wiki/Geometry.html" title="Geometry">geometry</a>, <a href="/wiki/Music.html" title="Music">music</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Astronomy.html" title="Astronomy">astronomy</a>) as offensive. In 1555, Dee became a member of the <a href="/wiki/Worshipful_Company_of_Mercers.html" title="Worshipful Company of Mercers">Worshipful Company of Mercers</a>, as his father had, through the company's system of <a href="/wiki/Patrimony.html" title="Patrimony">patrimony</a>.</p>
<p>That same year, 1555, he was arrested and charged with "calculating" for having cast <a href="/wiki/Horoscope.html" title="Horoscope">horoscopes</a> of <a href="/wiki/Mary_I_of_England.html" title="Mary I of England">Queen Mary</a> and <a href="/wiki/Elizabeth_I_of_England.html" title="Elizabeth I of England">Princess Elizabeth</a>; the charges were expanded to <a href="/wiki/Treason.html" title="Treason">treason</a> against Mary. Dee appeared in the <a href="/wiki/Star_Chamber.html" title="Star Chamber">Star Chamber</a> and exonerated himself, but was turned over to the reactionary <a href="/wiki/Roman_Catholic_Church.html" title="Roman Catholic Church">Catholic</a> <a href="/wiki/Edmund_Bonner.html" title="Edmund Bonner">Bishop Bonner</a> for religious examination. His strong and lifelong penchant for secrecy perhaps worsening matters, this entire episode was only the most dramatic in a series of attacks and slanders that would dog Dee through his life. Clearing his name yet again, he soon became a close associate of Bonner.</p>
<p>Dee presented Queen Mary with a visionary plan for the preservation of old books, manuscripts and records and the founding of a national <a href="/wiki/Library.html" title="Library">library</a>, in 1556, but his proposal was not taken up. Instead, he expanded his personal library at his house in <a href="/wiki/Mortlake.html" title="Mortlake">Mortlake</a>, tirelessly acquiring books and manuscripts in England and on the European Continent. Dee's library, a center of learning outside the universities, became the greatest in England and attracted many scholars.</p>
<p>When Elizabeth took the throne in 1558, Dee became her trusted advisor on matters astrological and scientific, choosing Elizabeth's coronation date himself. From the 1550s through the 1570s, he served as an advisor to England's voyages of discovery, providing technical assistance in navigation and ideological backing in the creation of a "British Empire", and was the first to use that term. In 1577, Dee published <i>General and Rare Memorials pertayning to the Perfect Arte of Navigation</i>, a work that set out his vision of a maritime empire and asserted English territorial claims on the <a href="/wiki/New_World.html" title="New World">New World</a>. Dee was acquainted with <a href="/wiki/Humphrey_Gilbert.html" title="Humphrey Gilbert">Humphrey Gilbert</a> and was close to Sir <a href="/wiki/Philip_Sidney.html" title="Philip Sidney">Philip Sidney</a> and his circle.</p>

</div>
<p>In 1564, Dee wrote the <a href="/wiki/Hermetica.html" title="Hermetica">Hermetic</a> work <i>Monas Hieroglyphica</i> ("The Hieroglyphic Monad"), an exhaustive <a href="/wiki/Kabbalah.html" title="Kabbalah">Cabalistic</a> interpretation of a <a href="/wiki/Glyph.html" title="Glyph">glyph</a> of his own design, meant to express the mystical unity of all creation. This work was highly valued by many of Dee's contemporaries, but the loss of the secret oral tradition of Dee's milieu makes the work difficult to interpret today.</p>
<p>He published a "Mathematical Preface" to <a href="/wiki/Henry_Billingsley.html" title="Henry Billingsley">Henry Billingsley</a>'s English translation of Euclid's <i><a href="/wiki/Euclid%27s_Elements.html" title="Euclid's Elements">Elements</a></i> in 1570, arguing the central importance of mathematics and outlining mathematics' influence on the other arts and sciences. Intended for an audience outside the universities, it proved to be Dee's most widely influential and frequently reprinted work.</p>

<h3>Later life</h3>
<p>By the early 1580s, Dee was growing dissatisfied with his progress in learning the secrets of nature and with his own lack of influence and recognition. He began to turn towards the <a href="/wiki/Supernatural.html" title="Supernatural">supernatural</a> as a means to acquire knowledge. Specifically, he sought to contact <a href="/wiki/Angel.html" title="Angel">angels</a> through the use of a "scryer" or <a href="/wiki/Crystal_ball.html" title="Crystal ball">crystal-gazer</a>, who would act as an intermediary between Dee and the angels.</p>
<p>Dee's first attempts were not satisfactory, but, in 1582, he met <a href="/wiki/Edward_Kelley.html" title="Edward Kelley">Edward Kelley</a>, who impressed him greatly with his abilities. Dee took Kelley into his service and began to devote all his energies to his supernatural pursuits. These "spiritual conferences" or "actions" were conducted with an air of intense Christian piety, always after periods of purification, <a href="/wiki/Prayer.html" title="Prayer">prayer</a> and <a href="/wiki/Fasting.html" title="Fasting">fasting</a>. Dee was convinced of the benefits they could bring to mankind. (The character of Kelley is harder to assess: some have concluded that he acted with complete cynicism, but delusion or self-deception are not out of the question. Kelley's "output" is remarkable for its sheer mass, its intricacy and its vividness.) Dee maintained that the angels laboriously dictated several books to him this way, some in a special angelic or <a href="/wiki/Enochian_language.html" title="Enochian language">Enochian</a> language.</p>
<p>In 1583, Dee met the visiting <a href="/wiki/Poland.html" title="Poland">Polish</a> nobleman <a  class="new" title="Albert Laski">Albert Łaski</a>, who invited the Englishman to accompany him on his return to Poland. With some prompting by the angels, Dee was persuaded to go. Dee, Kelley, and their families left for the Continent in September 1583, but Laski proved to be <a href="/wiki/Bankruptcy.html" title="Bankruptcy">bankrupt</a> and out of favor in his own country. Dee and Kelley began a <a href="/wiki/Nomad.html" title="Nomad">nomadic</a> life in <a href="/wiki/Central_Europe.html" title="Central Europe">Central Europe</a>, but they continued their spiritual conferences, which Dee recorded meticulously. He had audiences with <a href="/wiki/Rudolf_II%2C_Holy_Roman_Emperor.html" title="Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor">Emperor Rudolf II</a> and <a href="/wiki/Stefan_I_of_Poland.html" title="Stefan I of Poland">King Stephen</a> of Poland in which he chided them for their ungodliness and attempted to convince them of the importance of his angelic communications. He was not taken up by either monarch.</p>
<p>During a spiritual conference in <a href="/wiki/Bohemia.html" title="Bohemia">Bohemia</a>, in 1587, Kelley told Dee that the angel <a href="/wiki/Uriel.html" title="Uriel">Uriel</a> had ordered that the two men should <a href="/wiki/Open_marriage.html" title="Open marriage">share their wives</a>. Kelley, who by that time was becoming a prominent alchemist and was much more sought-after than Dee, may have wished to use this as a way to end the spiritual conferences. The order caused Dee great anguish, but he did not doubt its genuineness and apparently allowed it to go forward, but broke off the conferences immediately afterwards and did not see Kelley again. Dee returned to England in 1589.</p>

<h3>Personal life</h3>
<p>Dee was married three times and had eight children. His eldest son was <a href="/wiki/Arthur_Dee.html" title="Arthur Dee">Arthur Dee</a>, about whom Dee wrote a letter to his headmaster at <a href="/wiki/Westminster_School.html" title="Westminster School">Westminster School</a> which echos the worries of boarding school parents in every century; Arthur was also an alchemist and hermetic author. <a href="/wiki/John_Aubrey.html" title="John Aubrey">John Aubrey</a> gives the following description of Dee: "He was tall and slender. He wore a gown like an artist's gown, with hanging sleeves, and a slit.... A very fair, clear sanguine complexion... a long beard as white as milk. A very handsome man."</p>

<h3>Final years</h3>
<p>Dee returned to Mortlake after six years to find his library ruined and many of his prized books and instruments stolen. He sought support from Elizabeth, who finally made him warden of Christ's College, Manchester in <a href="/wiki/Manchester.html" title="Manchester">Manchester</a> (now <a href="/wiki/Manchester_Grammar_School.html" title="Manchester Grammar School">Manchester Grammar School</a>) in 1592. However, he was by now widely reviled as an evil magician and could not exert much control over the Fellows, who despised him. He left Manchester in 1605. By that time, Elizabeth was dead, and <a href="/wiki/James_I_of_England.html" title="James I of England">James I</a>, unsympathetic to anything related to the supernatural, provided no help. Dee spent his final years in poverty at <a href="/wiki/Mortlake.html" title="Mortlake">Mortlake</a>, where he died in late 1608 or early 1609. Unfortunately, both the <a href="/wiki/Parish_register.html" title="Parish register">parish registers</a> and Dee's <a href="/wiki/Gravestone.html" title="Gravestone">gravestone</a> are missing.</p>

<h3>Thought</h3>
<p>Dee was an intensely pious <a href="/wiki/Christianity.html" title="Christianity">Christian</a>, but his Christianity was deeply influenced by the Hermetic and <a href="/wiki/Plato.html" title="Plato">Platonic</a>-<a href="/wiki/Pythagoras.html" title="Pythagoras">Pythagorean</a> doctrines that were pervasive in the <a href="/wiki/Renaissance.html" title="Renaissance">Renaissance</a>. He believed that <a href="/wiki/Numerology.html" title="Numerology">number</a> was the basis of all things and the key to knowledge, that <a href="/wiki/God.html" title="God">God</a>'s creation was an act of "numbering". From <a href="/wiki/Hermeticism.html" title="Hermeticism">Hermeticism</a>, he drew the belief that man had the potential for divine power, and he believed this divine power could be exercised through mathematics. His cabalistic angel magic (which was heavily numerological) and his work on practical mathematics (navigation, for example) were simply the exalted and mundane ends of the same spectrum, not the antithetical activities many would see them as today. His ultimate goal was to help bring forth a unified world <a href="/wiki/Religion.html" title="Religion">religion</a> through the healing of the breach of the <a href="/wiki/Roman_Catholic_Church.html" title="Roman Catholic Church">Catholic</a> and <a href="/wiki/Protestantism.html" title="Protestantism">Protestant</a> churches and the recapture of the pure <a href="/wiki/Theology.html" title="Theology">theology</a> of the ancients.</p>

<h3>Reputation and significance</h3>
<p>About ten years after Dee's death, the <a href="/wiki/Antiquarian.html" title="Antiquarian">antiquarian</a> <a href="/wiki/Robert_Bruce_Cotton.html" title="Robert Bruce Cotton">Robert Cotton</a> purchased land around Dee's house and began digging in search of papers and artifacts. He discovered several manuscripts, mainly records of Dee's angelic communications. Cotton's son gave these manuscripts to the scholar <a href="/wiki/M%C3%A9ric_Casaubon.html" title="Méric Casaubon">Méric Casaubon</a>, who published them in 1659, together with a long introduction critical of their author, as <i>A True &amp; Faithful Relation of What passed for many Yeers between Dr. John Dee (A Mathematician of Great Fame in Q. Eliz. and King James their Reignes) and some spirits.</i> As the first public revelation of Dee's spiritual conferences, the book was extremely popular and sold quickly. Casaubon, who believed in the reality of spirits, argued in his introduction that Dee was acting as the unwitting tool of evil spirits when he believed he was communicating with angels. This book is largely responsible for the image, prevalent for the following two and a half centuries, of Dee as a dupe and deluded fanatic.</p>
<p>Around the same time the <i>True and Faithful Relation</i> was published, members of the <a href="/wiki/Rosicrucian.html" title="Rosicrucian">Rosicrucian</a> movement claimed Dee as one of their number. There is doubt, however, that an organized Rosicrucian movement existed during Dee's lifetime, and no evidence that he ever belonged to any secret fraternity. Dee's reputation as a magician and the vivid story of his association with Edward Kelley have made him a seemingly irresistible figure to <a href="/wiki/Fabulist.html" title="Fabulist">fabulists</a>, writers of <a  class="new" title="Horror stories">horror stories</a> and latter-day <a href="/wiki/Magician.html" title="Magician">magicians</a>. The accretion of false and often fanciful information about Dee often obscures the facts of his life, remarkable as they are in themselves.</p>
<p>A re-evaluation of Dee's character and significance came in the 20th century, largely as a result of the work of the historian <a href="/wiki/Frances_Yates.html" title="Frances Yates">Frances Yates</a>, who brought a new focus on the role of magic in the <a href="/wiki/Renaissance.html" title="Renaissance">Renaissance</a> and the development of modern science. As a result of this re-evaluation, Dee is now viewed as a serious scholar and appreciated as one of the most learned men of his day.</p>
<p>His personal library at Mortlake was the largest in the country, and was considered one of the finest in Europe, perhaps second only to that of <a href="/wiki/Jacques_Auguste_de_Thou.html" title="Jacques Auguste de Thou">de Thou</a>. As well as being an astrological, scientific and geographical advisor to Elizabeth and her court, he was an early advocate of the colonization of <a href="/wiki/North_America.html" title="North America">North America</a> and a visionary of a British Empire stretching across the <a href="/wiki/North_Atlantic.html" title="North Atlantic">North Atlantic</a>.</p>
<p>Dee promoted the sciences of navigation and <a href="/wiki/Cartography.html" title="Cartography">cartography</a>. He studied closely with <a href="/wiki/Gerardus_Mercator.html" title="Gerardus Mercator">Gerardus Mercator</a>, and he owned an important collection of <a href="/wiki/Map.html" title="Map">maps</a>, <a href="/wiki/Globe.html" title="Globe">globes</a> and astronomical instruments. He developed new instruments as well as special navigational techniques for use in <a href="/wiki/Polar.html" title="Polar">polar</a> regions. Dee served as an advisor to the English voyages of discovery, and personally selected pilots and trained them in navigation.</p>
<p>He believed that mathematics (which he understood mystically) was central to the progress of human learning. The centrality of mathematics to Dee's vision makes him to that extent more modern than <a href="/wiki/Francis_Bacon.html" title="Francis Bacon">Francis Bacon</a>, though some scholars believe Bacon purposely downplayed mathematics in the anti-occult atmosphere of the reign of James I. It should be noted, though, that Dee's understanding of the role of mathematics is radically different from our contemporary view.</p>
<p>Dee's most long-lasting practical achievement may be his promotion of mathematics outside the universities. His "Mathematical Preface" to Euclid was meant to promote the study and application of mathematics by those without a university education, and was very popular and influential among the "mecanicians": the new and growing class of technical craftsmen and artisans. Dee's preface included demonstrations of mathematical principles that readers could perform themselves.</p>
<p>Dee was a friend of <a href="/wiki/Tycho_Brahe.html" title="Tycho Brahe">Tycho Brahe</a> and was familiar with the work of <a href="/wiki/Copernicus.html" title="Copernicus">Copernicus</a>. Many of his astronomical calculations were based on Copernican assumptions, but he never openly espoused the <a href="/wiki/Heliocentrism.html" title="Heliocentrism">heliocentric</a> theory. Dee applied Copernican theory to the problem of <a href="/wiki/Calendar.html" title="Calendar">calendar</a> reform. His sound recommendations were not accepted, however, for political reasons.</p>
<p>He has often been associated with the <a href="/wiki/Voynich_Manuscript.html" title="Voynich Manuscript">Voynich Manuscript</a>. <a href="/wiki/Wilfrid_M._Voynich.html" title="Wilfrid M. Voynich">Wilfrid M. Voynich</a>, who bought the manuscript in 1912, suggested that Dee may have owned the manuscript and sold it to <a href="/wiki/Rudolf_II%2C_Holy_Roman_Emperor.html" title="Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor">Rudolph II</a>. Dee's contacts with Rudolph were far less extensive than had previously been thought, however, and Dee's diaries show no evidence of the sale.</p>

<h3>Artefacts</h3>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/British_Museum.html" title="British Museum">British Museum</a> holds several items once owned by Dee and associated with the spiritual conferences:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dee's Speculum or Mirror (an <a href="/wiki/Obsidian.html" title="Obsidian">obsidian</a> <a href="/wiki/Aztec.html" title="Aztec">Aztec</a> cult object in the shape of a hand-mirror, brought to Europe in the late 1520s), which was once owned by <a href="/wiki/Horace_Walpole%2C_4th_Earl_of_Orford.html" title="Horace Walpole, 4th Earl of Orford">Horace Walpole</a>.</li>
<li>The small <a href="/wiki/Seal_%28device%29.html" title="Seal (device)">wax seals</a> used to support the legs of Dee's "table of practice" (the table at which the scrying was performed).</li>
<li>The large, elaborately-decorated wax "Seal of God", used to support the "shew-stone", the <a href="/wiki/Crystal_ball.html" title="Crystal ball">crystal ball</a> used for scrying.</li>
<li>A gold <a href="/wiki/Amulet.html" title="Amulet">amulet</a> engraved with a representation of one of Kelley's visions.</li>
<li>A crystal globe, six centimetres in diameter. This item remained unnoticed for many years in the <a href="/wiki/Mineral.html" title="Mineral">mineral</a> collection; possibly the one owned by Dee, but the provenance of this object is less certain than that of the others.</li>
</ul>
<p>In December 2004, both a shew-stone (a stone used for scrying) formerly belonging to Dee and a mid-1600s explanation of its use written by <a href="/wiki/Nicholas_Culpeper.html" title="Nicholas Culpeper">Nicholas Culpeper</a> were stolen from the <a href="/wiki/Science_Museum_%28London%29.html" title="Science Museum (London)">Science Museum</a> in London; they were recovered shortly afterwards.</p>
