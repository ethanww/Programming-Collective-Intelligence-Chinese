			<p><b>Software Engineering</b> (SE) is the discipline of designing, creating, and maintaining <a href="/wiki/Software.html" title="Software">software</a> by applying <a href="/wiki/List_of_software_engineering_topics#Technologies_and_practices.html" title="List of software engineering topics">technologies and practices</a> from <a href="/wiki/Computer_science.html" title="Computer science">computer science</a>, <a href="/wiki/Project_management.html" title="Project management">project management</a>, <a href="/wiki/Engineering.html" title="Engineering">engineering</a>, <a href="/wiki/Domain_knowledge.html" title="Domain knowledge">application domains</a> and other fields.</p>
<p>The term <i>software engineering</i> was popularized after 1968<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a  title="">[1]</a></sup>, during the <a  title="List of publications in computer science">1968 NATO Software Engineering Conference</a> (held in <a href="/wiki/Garmisch.html" title="Garmisch">Garmisch</a>, Germany) by its chairman <a href="/wiki/F.L._Bauer.html" title="F.L.

<p>The term <i>software engineering</i> has been commonly used with a variety of distinct meanings:</p>

<p>Software engineering is concerned with the application of engineering principles to the conception, development and verification of a software system. This discipline deals with identifying, defining, realizing and verifying the required characteristics of the resultant software. These software characteristics may include: functionality, reliability, maintainability, availability, testability, ease-of-use, portability, and other attributes. Software engineering addresses these characteristics by preparing design and technical specifications that, if implemented properly, will result in software that can be verified to meet these requirements.</p>
<p>Software engineering is also concerned with the characteristics of the software development process. In this regard, it deals with characteristics such as cost of development, duration of development, and risks in development of software.</p>

<h2>The need for Software Engineering</h2>
<p>Software is often found in products and situations where 'absolute' reliability is required, even under demanding conditions, such as monitoring and controlling nuclear power plants, or keeping a modern airliner aloft<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a  title="">[2]</a></sup> Such applications contain millions of <a href="/wiki/Source_lines_of_code.html" title="Source lines of code">lines of code</a>, making them comparable in complexity to the most complex modern machines. For example, a modern airliner has several million physical parts<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a  title="">[3]</a></sup> (and the space shuttle about ten million parts<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a  title="">[4]</a></sup>), while the software for such an airliner can run to 4 million lines of code<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a  title="">[5]</a></sup>. It would be impossible to manage the development, testing, and maintenance of such immense and complex software without the application of rigorous software engineering practices<sup title="The text in the vicinity of this tag needs citation." class="noprint">[<a  title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><i>citation&#160;needed</i></a>]</sup>.</p>

<p>The use of "software engineer" as a corporate job title dates from at least 1990<sup title="The text in the vicinity of this tag needs citation." class="noprint">[<a  title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><i>citation&#160;needed</i></a>]</sup>. The person who has the job title "software engineer" and performs his job according to the job description for a "software engineer" is generally thought of as a software engineer. However, Bachelor's degrees in Software Engineering have become available from many well known universities. People who are from the outside of the corporate setting may believe that there are currently no widely accepted criteria for distinguishing someone who is a software engineer from someone who is not a software engineer. In addition, the industry is in the midst of a complex debate on the licensing of practicing software engineers. The two sides of the debate consider whether the job is a creative art or a repeatable science. In actual practice, the existing system of checking the work of the 'software engineer' when required by law by a state licensed professional engineer is considered adequate for legal liability reasons.</p>

<h3>Debate over the term 'Engineering'</h3>
<p>Some people believe that <i>software development</i> is a more appropriate term than <i>software engineering</i> for the process of creating software. <a  class="new" title="Pete McBreen">Pete McBreen</a>, (author of "<a href="/wiki/Software_Craftsmanship.html" title="Software Craftsmanship">Software Craftsmanship</a>: The New Imperative" (<a  class="internal">ISBN 0-201-73386-2</a>)), argues that the term Software Engineering implies levels of rigor and proven processes that are not appropriate for all types of software development. He argues strongly for 'craftsmanship' as a more appropriate metaphor because that term brings into sharper focus the skills of the developer as the key to success instead of the "manufacturing" process. Using a more traditional comparison, just as not everyone who works in construction is a civil engineer, not everyone who can write code is a software engineer.</p>
<p>Some people dispute the notion that the field is mature enough to warrant the title "engineering"<sup title="The text in the vicinity of this tag needs citation." class="noprint">[<a  title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><i>citation&#160;needed</i></a>]</sup>. Opposition also comes from the traditional engineering disciplines, whose practitioners usually object to the use of the title "engineer" by anyone who has not gone through an accredited program of engineering education<sup title="The text in the vicinity of this tag needs citation." class="noprint">[<a  title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><i>citation&#160;needed</i></a>]</sup>. In each of the last few decades, at least one radical new approach has entered the mainstream of software development (e.g. <a href="/wiki/Structured_programming.html" title="Structured programming">Structured Programming</a>, <a href="/wiki/Object-oriented_programming.html" title="Object-oriented programming">Object Orientation</a>, ... ), implying that the field is still changing too rapidly to be considered an engineering discipline. Other people would argue that the supposedly radical new approaches are actually evolutionary rather than revolutionary, the mere introduction of new tools rather than fundamental changes<sup title="The text in the vicinity of this tag needs citation." class="noprint">[<a  title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><i>citation&#160;needed</i></a>]</sup>.</p>

<p>In 2006, Money Magazine and Salary.com rated software engineering as the best job in America in terms of growth, pay, stress levels, flexibility in hours and working environment, creativity, and how easy it is to enter and advance in the field<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a  title="">[7]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Software engineers advocate many different technologies and practices, with much disagreement. This debate has gone on for 60 years and may continue forever. Software engineers use a wide variety of technologies and practices. Practitioners use a wide variety of technologies: compilers, code repositories, word processors. Practitioners use a wide variety of practices to carry out and coordinate their efforts: <a href="/wiki/Pair_programming.html" title="Pair programming">pair programming</a>, code reviews and daily stand up meetings.</p>
<p>In spite of the enormous economic growth and productivity gains enabled by software, persistent complaints about the quality of software remain. Deficient software engineering is often blamed for project failures when the blame might more properly be placed with business managers who ignore lessons already learned by software engineers<sup title="The text in the vicinity of this tag needs citation." class="noprint">[<a  title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><i>citation&#160;needed</i></a>]</sup>.</p>

Some organizations have specialists to perform each of the tasks in the <a href="/wiki/Software_development_process.html" title="Software development process">software development process</a>. Other organizations required software engineers to do many or all of them. In large projects, people may specialize in only one role.

<h3>Certification</h3>
<p><a href="/wiki/Certification_%28software_engineering%29.html" title="Certification (software engineering)">Certification of software engineers</a> is a contentious issue. Some see it as a tool to improve <a href="/wiki/Professional_engineer.html" title="Professional engineer">professional practice</a>. Others point out that very few traditional engineers bother with any form of certification.</p>
<p>Most successful certification programs in the software industry are oriented toward specific technologies, and are managed by the vendors of these technologies. These certification programs are tailored to the institutions that would employ people who use these technologies. General certification of software practitioners has struggled. The <a href="/wiki/Association_for_Computing_Machinery.html" title="Association for Computing Machinery">ACM</a> had a professional certification program in the early 1980s, which was discontinued due to lack of interest. Today, the <a href="/wiki/IEEE.html" title="IEEE">IEEE</a> is certifying software professionals, but only about 500 people have passed the exam by March 2005.

<h3>Impact of Globalization</h3>
<p>Many students in the developed world have avoided degrees related to software engineering because of the fear of <a href="/wiki/Offshore_outsourcing.html" title="Offshore outsourcing">offshore outsourcing</a> (importing software products from other countries) and of being displaced by <a href="/wiki/Foreign_Worker_Visa.html" title="Foreign Worker Visa">foreign visa workers</a> <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.computerworld.com/printthis/2006/0,4814,111202,00.html">[1]</a>. Although government statistics do not currently show a threat to software engineering itself; a related career, <a href="/wiki/Computer_programming.html" title="Computer programming">computer programming</a> does appear to have been affected <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos110.htm#outlook">[2]</a>. Often one is expected to start out as a computer programmer before being promoted to software engineer. Thus, the career path to software engineering may be rough, especially during recessions.</p>
<p>Some career counselors suggest a student also focus on "people skills" and business skills rather than purely technical skills because such "soft skills" are allegedly more difficult to offshore <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleTOC&amp;specialReportId=9000100&amp;articleId=112360">[3]</a>.

<p>Many fields are closely related to software engineering; here are some key similarities and distinctions. Comparing SE with other fields helps explain what SE is and helps define what SE might or should become. There is considerable debate over which fields SE most resembles (or should most resemble). These complex and inexact comparisons explain why some see software engineering as its own field.</p>

<p>Software engineering resembles many different fields in many different ways. The following paragraphs make some simple comparisons.</p>
<dl>
<dt><a href="/wiki/Mathematics.html" title="Mathematics">Mathematics</a></dt>
<dd>Programs have many mathematical properties. For example the correctness and <a href="/wiki/Complexity.html" title="Complexity">complexity</a> of many algorithms are mathematical concepts that can be rigorously proven. Programs are finite, so in principle, developers could know many things about a program in a rigorous mathematical way. The use of mathematics within software engineering is often called <a href="/wiki/Formal_methods.html" title="Formal methods">formal methods</a>. However, <a href="/wiki/Computability_theory_%28computation%29.html" title="Computability theory (computation)">computability theory</a> shows that not everything useful about a program can be proven. Mathematics works best for small pieces of code and has difficulty scaling up.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><a href="/wiki/Science.html" title="Science">Science</a></dt>
<dd>Programs have many scientific properties that can be measured. For example, the performance and scalability of programs under various workloads can be measured. The effectiveness of caches, bigger processors, faster networks, newer databases are scientific issues. Mathematical equations can sometimes be deduced from the measurements. Scientific approaches work best for system-wide analysis, but often are meaningless when comparing different small fragments of code.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><a href="/wiki/Engineering.html" title="Engineering">Engineering</a></dt>
<dd>Software Engineering is considered by many to be an <a href="/wiki/Engineering.html" title="Engineering">engineering</a> discipline because there are pragmatic approaches and expected characteristics of engineers. Proper analysis, documentation, and commented code are signs of an engineer. <a href="/wiki/David_Parnas.html" title="David Parnas">David Parnas</a> has argued that software engineering is engineering<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a  title="">[8]</a></sup>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><a href="/wiki/Manufacturing.html" title="Manufacturing">Manufacturing</a></dt>
<dd>Programs are built in as a sequence of steps. By properly defining and carrying out those steps, much like a manufacturing assembly line, advocates hope to improve the productivity of developers and the quality of final programs. This approach inspires the many different processes and methodologies. While others, such as the authors of the <a href="/wiki/Programmer%27s_Stone.html" title="Programmer's Stone">Programmer's Stone</a>, contend this view "[is] in fact claiming to be able to implement an Artificial Intelligence that simulates a production line designer"<sup id="_ref-Reciprocality_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[9]</a></sup>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><a href="/wiki/Project_management.html" title="Project management">Project management</a></dt>
<dd>Commercial (and many non-commercial) software projects require management. There are budgets and schedules to set. People to hire and lead. Resources (office space, computers) to acquire. All of this fits more appropriately within the purview of management.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><a href="/wiki/Art.html" title="Art">Art</a></dt>
<dd>Programs contain many artistic elements, akin to writing or painting. User interfaces should be aesthetically pleasing to users. Code should be aesthetically pleasing to programmers. What is considered "good design" is usually subjective, and must be decided by one's own sense of aesthetics. Even the decision of whether a variable name or class name is clear and simple is an artistic question. <a href="/wiki/Donald_Knuth.html" title="Donald Knuth">Donald Knuth</a> asserted that programming is an art.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><a href="/wiki/Performance.html" title="Performance">Performance</a></dt>
<dd>The act of writing software requires that developers summon the energy to find the answers they need while they are at the keyboard. Creating software is a performance that resembles what athletes do on the field, and actors and musicians do on stage. Some argue that SEs need inspiration to spark the creation of code. Sometimes a creative spark is needed to create the <a href="/wiki/Software_architecture.html" title="Software architecture">architecture</a> or to develop a unit of code to solve a particularly intractable problem. Others argue that discipline is the key attribute. <a href="/wiki/Pair_programming.html" title="Pair programming">Pair programming</a> emphasizes this point of view. Both <a href="/wiki/Kent_Beck.html" title="Kent Beck">Kent Beck</a> and <a href="/wiki/Watts_Humphrey.html" title="Watts Humphrey">Watts Humphrey</a> have argued this emphasis.

<p>Is SE (or should SE be) a branch of programming, a branch of computer science, a branch of traditional engineering, or a field that stands on its own? There is considerable <a  title="">debate</a> over this. This has important implications for professionalism, licensing, and ethics. Licensing is a polarizing issue: some fiercely advocate it while others staunchly oppose it.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Branch of programming</dt>
<dd>Programming emphasizes writing code, independent of projects and customers. Software engineering emphasizes writing code in the context of projects and customers by making plans and delivering applications. As a branch of programming, SE would probably have no significant licensing or professionalism issues.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>Branch of computer science</dt>
<dd>Many believe that software engineering is a part of computer science, because of their close historical connections and their relationship to mathematics. They advocate keeping SE a part of computer science. Both computer science and software engineering care about programs. Computer science emphasizes the theoretical, eternal truths while software engineering emphasizes practical, everyday usefulness. Some argue that computer science is to software engineering as physics and chemistry are to traditional engineering. As a branch of computer science, SE would probably have few licensing or professionalism concerns.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>Branch of engineering</dt>
<dd>Some SE academics and practitioners, such as <a href="/wiki/David_Parnas.html" title="David Parnas">David Parnas</a><sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a  title="">[10]</a></sup> and <a href="/wiki/Steve_McConnell.html" title="Steve McConnell">Steve McConnell</a><sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a  title="">[11]</a></sup>, have advocated treating SE an engineering discipline. Advocates for this view argue that the practice of engineering involves the use of mathematics, science, and the technology of the day, to build trustworthy products that are "fit for purpose", a description that applies as well to SE as to any other engineering discipline. As a branch of engineering, SE would probably adopt the engineering model of licensing and professionalism.</dd>

<dt>Freestanding field</dt>
<dd>Recently, software engineering has been finding its own identity and emerging as an important freestanding field<sup title="The text in the vicinity of this tag needs citation." class="noprint">[<a  title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><i>citation&#160;needed</i></a>]</sup>. Practitioners are slowly realizing that they form a huge community in their own right.

It is arguable that licensing (in the United States) is inappropriate because the creation of software represents a form of writing, and requiring people to be licensed in order to write computer programs may be a violation of the First Amendment<sup title="The text in the vicinity of this tag needs citation." class="noprint">[<a  title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><i>citation&#160;needed</i></a>]</sup>. Requiring software engineers to be licensed by a government bureaucracy would make persons who create software without a license into criminals, even if they give their software away, same as practicing medicine or law without a license, even for free, is a criminal offense.</dd>
