<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Musical career">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Musical_career" id="Musical_career"></a></p>
<h2>Musical career</h2>
<p>As an undergraduate student at <a href="/wiki/Harvard_University.html" title="Harvard University">Harvard University</a>, he began to write comic songs to entertain his friends, including "Fight Fiercely, Harvard" (1945). Those songs later became (in a joking reference to <a href="/wiki/Physical_Review.html" title="Physical Review">a leading scientific journal</a>) <i>The Physical Revue</i>. Influenced mainly by musical theater, his style consisted of parodying the then-current forms of popular song. For example, his appreciation of <a href="/wiki/List_song.html" title="List song">list songs</a> led him to set the names of <a href="/wiki/The_Elements_%28song%29.html" title="The Elements (song)">the chemical elements</a> to the tune of <a href="/wiki/Gilbert_and_Sullivan.html" title="Gilbert and Sullivan">Gilbert and Sullivan</a>'s "<a href="/wiki/Major_General%27s_Song.html" title="Major General's Song">Major General's Song</a>".</p>
<p>Inspired by the success of his performances of his songs, he paid for some studio time to record an album, <i>Songs by Tom Lehrer</i>, which he sold by mail order. <a href="/wiki/Self-publishing.html" title="Self-publishing">Self-published</a> and unpromoted, the album, which included the macabre ("I Hold Your Hand In Mine"), the mildly risqué ("Be Prepared"), and the mathematical ("<a href="/wiki/Nikolai_Ivanovich_Lobachevsky.html" title="Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky">Lobachevsky</a>"), became a success via word of mouth. With a cult hit, he embarked on a series of concert tours and released a second album, which came in two versions: the songs were the same but <i>More Songs by Tom Lehrer</i> was studio-recorded, while <i><a href="/wiki/An_Evening_Wasted_with_Tom_Lehrer.html" title="An Evening Wasted with Tom Lehrer">An Evening Wasted with Tom Lehrer</a></i> was recorded live in concert.</p>
<p>By the early 1960s Lehrer had retired from touring (which he intensely disliked) and was employed as the resident songwriter for the US edition of <i><a href="/wiki/That_Was_The_Week_That_Was.html" title="That Was The Week That Was">That Was The Week That Was</a></i> (TW3), a satirical TV show. An increased proportion of his output became overtly <a href="/wiki/Politics.html" title="Politics">political</a>, or at least topical, on subjects such as <a href="/wiki/Pollution.html" title="Pollution">pollution</a> ("Pollution"), <a href="/wiki/Vatican_II.html" title="Vatican II">Vatican II</a> ("The Vatican Rag"), <a href="/wiki/Race_relations.html" title="Race relations">race relations</a> ("National Brotherhood Week"), American militarism ("Send the Marines") and <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_proliferation.html" title="Nuclear proliferation">nuclear proliferation</a> ("Who's Next?" and "We Will All Go Together When We Go"). He also wrote a song which satirized the alleged amorality of <a href="/wiki/Wernher_von_Braun.html" title="Wernher von Braun">Wernher von Braun</a>. A selection of these songs was released in the album <i><a href="/wiki/That_Was_The_Year_That_Was.html" title="That Was The Year That Was">That Was The Year That Was</a></i>.</p>
<p>The record deal with <a href="/wiki/Reprise_Records.html" title="Reprise Records">Reprise Records</a> for the <i>That Was The Year That Was</i> album also gave Reprise distribution rights for Lehrer's earlier recordings as Lehrer wanted to shut down his own Lehrer Records. The Reprise issue of <i>Songs by Tom Lehrer</i> was a stereo re-recording. This version was not issued on CD, but the songs were issued on the live <i><a href="/wiki/Tom_Lehrer_Revisited.html" title="Tom Lehrer Revisited">Tom Lehrer Revisited</a></i> on CD instead.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Departure from the scene">edit</a>]</div>

<h2>Departure from the scene</h2>
<div class="floatleft"><span><a  class="image" title=""><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/1d/Lehrer_book.JPG" alt="" width="143" height="204" longdesc="/wiki/Image:Lehrer_book.JPG" /></a></span></div>
<p>There is an <a href="/wiki/Urban_legend.html" title="Urban legend">urban legend</a> that Lehrer gave up <a href="/wiki/Political_satire.html" title="Political satire">political satire</a> when the <a href="/wiki/Nobel_Prize/Peace.html" title="Nobel Prize/Peace">Nobel Peace Prize</a> was awarded to <a href="/wiki/Henry_Kissinger.html" title="Henry Kissinger">Henry Kissinger</a> in 1973. He did say that the awarding of the prize to Kissinger made political satire obsolete, but has denied that he stopped doing satire as a form of protest, and asserts that he had stopped doing satire several years earlier.</p>
<p>When asked about his reasons for abandoning his musical career, he cited a simple lack of interest, a distaste for touring, and boredom with performing the same songs repeatedly. He has observed that when he was moved to write and perform songs, he did; when he wasn't, he didn't, and after a while the latter situation prevailed. It has been frequently observed that, though many of Lehrer's songs satirized the <a href="/wiki/Cold_War.html" title="Cold War">Cold War</a> political establishment of the day, that he stopped writing and performing just as the 1960s counterculture movement gained momentum. Lehrer has stated that he doubts his songs had an impact on those not already critical of the establishment: "I don't think this kind of thing has an impact on the unconverted, frankly. It's not even preaching to the converted; it's titillating the converted... I'm fond of quoting <a href="/wiki/Peter_Cook.html" title="Peter Cook">Peter Cook</a>, who talked about the satirical <a href="/wiki/Berlin.html" title="Berlin">Berlin</a> <a href="/wiki/Cabaret.html" title="Cabaret">cabarets</a> of the '30s, which did so much to stop the rise of <a href="/wiki/Adolf_Hitler.html" title="Adolf Hitler">Hitler</a> and prevent the <a href="/wiki/World_War_II.html" title="World War II">Second World War</a>."<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a  title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>In the 1970s he concentrated on teaching <a href="/wiki/Mathematics.html" title="Mathematics">mathematics</a> and <a href="/wiki/Musical_theater.html" title="Musical theater">musical theater</a>, although he also wrote the occasional educational song for the children's television show <i><a href="/wiki/The_Electric_Company.html" title="The Electric Company">The Electric Company</a></i>. In the early 1980s, <i><a href="/wiki/Tom_Foolery.html" title="Tom Foolery">Tom Foolery</a></i>, a revival of his songs on the London stage, was a surprise hit. Although not its instigator, Lehrer eventually gave it his full support and updated several of his lyrics for the production.</p>
<p>In 2000, a CD <a href="/wiki/Box_set.html" title="Box set">box set</a>, <i>The Remains of Tom Lehrer</i>, was released by <a href="/wiki/Rhino_Entertainment.html" title="Rhino Entertainment">Rhino Entertainment</a>. It included live and studio versions of his first two albums, <i>That Was The Year That Was</i>, the songs he wrote for <i>The Electric Company</i>, and some previously unreleased material, accompanied by a small hardbound book containing an introduction by <a href="/wiki/Dr._Demento.html" title="Dr. Demento">Dr. Demento</a> and lyrics to all the songs.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Lehrer the scholar">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Lehrer_the_scholar" id="Lehrer_the_scholar"></a></p>
<h2>Lehrer the scholar</h2>
<p>Lehrer earned his BA in mathematics (<a href="/wiki/Latin_honors.html" title="Latin honors">Magna Cum Laude</a>) from <a href="/wiki/Harvard_University.html" title="Harvard University">Harvard University</a> in 1947, when he was 18. He received his MA the next year, and was inducted into <a href="/wiki/Phi_Beta_Kappa.html" title="Phi Beta Kappa">Phi Beta Kappa</a>. He taught classes at <a href="/wiki/Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology.html" title="Massachusetts Institute of Technology">MIT</a>, Harvard and <a href="/wiki/Wellesley_College.html" title="Wellesley College">Wellesley</a>. He remained in Harvard's doctoral program for several years, taking time out for his musical career and to work as a researcher at <a href="/wiki/Los_Alamos%2C_New_Mexico.html" title="Los Alamos, New Mexico">Los Alamos, New Mexico</a>. He joined the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Army.html" title="United States Army">Army</a> from 1955 to 1957, working at the <a href="/wiki/National_Security_Agency.html" title="National Security Agency">National Security Agency</a>. All of these experiences eventually became fodder for songs: "<a  class="new" title="Fight Fiercely, Harvard">Fight Fiercely, Harvard</a>", "The Wild West Is Where I Want To Be" and "It Makes a Fellow Proud to Be a Soldier", respectively.</p>
<p>In 1960, Lehrer returned to full-time studies at Harvard. However, he never completed his doctoral studies, and never received a PhD in mathematics. In 1972, he joined the faculty of the <a href="/wiki/University_of_California%2C_Santa_Cruz.html" title="University of California, Santa Cruz">University of California, Santa Cruz</a>, teaching an introductory course entitled "The Nature of Mathematics" to liberal-arts majors — "Math for Tenors", according to Lehrer. He also taught a class in musical theater.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Lehrer's legacy">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Lehrer.27s_legacy" id="Lehrer.27s_legacy"></a></p>
<h2>Lehrer's legacy</h2>
<p>Lehrer was praised by <a href="/wiki/Dr._Demento.html" title="Dr. Demento">Dr. Demento</a> as "the best musical satirist of the <a href="/wiki/20th_Century.html" title="20th Century">20th Century</a>."</p>
<p>When asked by an Australian newspaper about his silence since the 1960s and his legacy now, he commented that his particular brand of political satire is more difficult in the modern world. "The real issues I don't think most people touch. The <a href="/wiki/Bill_Clinton.html" title="Bill Clinton">Clinton</a> jokes are all about <a href="/wiki/Monica_Lewinsky.html" title="Monica Lewinsky">Monica Lewinsky</a> and all that stuff and not about the important things, like the fact that he wouldn't ban <a href="/wiki/Land_mine.html" title="Land mine">landmines</a>... I'm not tempted to write a song about <a href="/wiki/George_W._Bush.html" title="George W. Bush">George W. Bush</a>. I couldn't figure out what sort of song I would write. That's the problem: I don't want to satirise George Bush and his puppeteers, I want to vaporise them."<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a  title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>A play, called <a href="/wiki/Letters_From_Lehrer.html" title="Letters From Lehrer">Letters From Lehrer</a>, has been written by <a href="/wiki/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canadian</a> <a href="/wiki/Richard_Greenblatt_%28playwright%29.html" title="Richard Greenblatt (playwright)">Richard Greenblatt</a>, and performed by him at <a href="/wiki/CanStage.html" title="CanStage">CanStage</a>, from <a href="/wiki/January_16.html" title="January 16">January 16</a> to <a href="/wiki/February_25.html" title="February 25">February 25</a>, <a href="/wiki/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>. It follows Lehrer's musical career, the meaning of several songs, the politics of the time, and Greenblatt's own experiences with Lehrer's music, while playing some of Lehrer's songs. There are currently no plans for more performances, although low-quality audio recordings have begun to circulate around the net.</p>
