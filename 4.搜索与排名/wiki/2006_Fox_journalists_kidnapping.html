<h3>Media organisations</h3>
<p>In an internal message by Fox News Channel Senior Vice President John Moody confirmed the abduction and warned about reporting on the story.<sup id="_ref-moddy_email_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Al-Jazeera.html" title="Al-Jazeera">Al-Jazeera</a> called for the "immediate release" of the journalists and "in adherence to its code of ethics, reiterates its rejection of attacks of any kind on journalists from any organisation.

<p>Journalist <a  class="new" title="Fares Akram">Fares Akram</a>, who works in the same building Wiig did, said he thinks Palestinian officials have information on Wiig's captors and their location. Hole said he has "seen those reports too, but nothing's come through to us that changes the current situation."<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a  title="">[9]</a></sup></p>

<p>Jan Henderson, NZ Ambassador to Turkey and Israel, arrived in Gaza on <a href="/wiki/August_15.html" title="August 15">August 15</a>.

The <a href="/wiki/Palestinian_Authority.html" title="Palestinian Authority">Palestinian Authority</a> has offered every cooperation. They are very upset. They have condemned the kidnapping, and they assured me they are doing everything they can for a quick and speedy resolution."<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a  title="">[11]</a></sup> After meeting with Abbas, Prime Minister Clark said, "On hearing of the kidnapping he had instructed the security apparatus of the Palestinian Authority to work to locate the kidnappers and secure the release...<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a  title="">[12]</a></sup> President Abbas was very fulsome in what he said. His parting comment was `these people are our guests and we will do whatever we can to help'."<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a  title="">[13]</a></sup></p>
<p>Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade spokesman Rob Hole said there were no developments as of <a href="/wiki/August_18.html" title="August 18">August 18</a>, but said that NZ diplomats were "still active in talking but also active in waiting as well, so no breakthrough at all." Ambassador Henderson and the NZ <a href="/wiki/Consul.html" title="Consul">consul</a> to <a href="/wiki/Egypt.html" title="Egypt">Egypt</a> Brian Chambers have met with officials from the Palestinian, British, American and Australian foreign ministries.

McNaught said that although it was unusual for so much time to pass without news, "every kidnapping is different. There is no handbook for how you do them." She expressed hope for a breakthrough in the case in the next few days and said she was meeting with several senior officials.<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a  title="">[16]</a></sup> If Wiig is released, McNaught says it is unlikely they will soon leave the area.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a  title="">[17]</a></sup></p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/August_17.html" title="August 17">August 17</a> the <a href="/wiki/United_States_State_Department.html" title="United States State Department">United States State Department</a> condemned the kidnappings and called for the journalists to be freed immediately.

<p>"<i>During <a href="/wiki/2005-2006_Christian_Peacemaker_hostage_crisis.html" title="2005-2006 Christian Peacemaker hostage crisis">our captivity in Iraq</a>, virtually all of Palestine called for our release. Today, I implore those holding Olaf Wiig and Steve Centanni to free them immediately and unharmed.</i></p>
<p><i>It is essential that we, the public, understand the greater context within which the kidnapping has taken place.

<p>On <a href="/wiki/August_27.html" title="August 27">August 27</a>, the Palestinian news service Ramattan and FOX News reported<sup id="_ref-release_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[20]</a></sup> that Centanni and fellow captive Wiig were released unharmed, shortly after a new video was released. In the video, both journalists, wearing beige robes, read statements saying that they had converted to <a href="/wiki/Islam.html" title="Islam">Islam</a>, with Centanni stating "Islam is not just meant for some people; it is the true religion for all people at all times." <sup id="_ref-release_1" class="reference"><a  title="">[20]</a></sup> After being freed Steve Centanni stated "We were forced to convert to Islam at gunpoint, and don't get me wrong here, I have the highest respect for Islam, and learned a lot of very good things about it, but it was something we felt we had to do, because they had the guns, and we didn't know what the hell was going on." <sup id="_ref-release_2" class="reference"><a  title="">[20]</a></sup></p>

<p>After their return to New York, Centanni and Wigg gave an interview with <a href="/wiki/Greta_Van_Susteren.html" title="Greta Van Susteren">Greta Van Susteren</a> on her FOX program <a href="/wiki/On_the_Record_%28television_program%29.html" title="On the Record (television program)">On the Record</a>. According to Wiig, the kidnappers were convinced that Centanni worked for the <a href="/wiki/Central_Intelligence_Agency.html" title="Central Intelligence Agency">CIA</a> in part because of his presence as a journalist at the deaths of <a href="/wiki/Uday_Hussein.html" title="Uday Hussein">Uday</a> and <a href="/wiki/Qusay_Hussein.html" title="Qusay Hussein">Qusay Hussein</a> in <a href="/wiki/Iraq.html" title="Iraq">Iraq</a>, and that they intended to kill Centanni. Nevertheless, they repeatedly promised both men they would soon be freed. McNaught, who was in <a href="/wiki/Damascus.html" title="Damascus">Damascus</a> covering the war in Lebanon, rushed to Gaza; she says "Everything has changed now in Gaza. This was an unforeseen and tragic event that has shocked Gazans to the core." <a  class="new" title="Jennifer Griffin">Jennifer Griffin</a>, a FOX correspondent who was closely involved in negotiations to free the two, said "We met with warlords. We met with head of Hamas, Fatah, Al Aqsa Brigade, popular resistance committees. Islamic Jihad offered to help us." At one point, Griffin and others were taken to a tense meeting with top members of various Palestinian groups. <sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a  title="">[21]</a></sup></p>
