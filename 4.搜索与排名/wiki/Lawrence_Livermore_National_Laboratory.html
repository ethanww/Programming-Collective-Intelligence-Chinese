<h2>Origins</h2>
<p>The main site, at the location of a former <a href="/wiki/World_War_II.html" title="World War II">World War II</a> Naval Training Station, was originally used to house projects of the <a href="/wiki/University_of_California_Radiation_Laboratory.html" title="University of California Radiation Laboratory">University of California Radiation Laboratory</a> which were too large for its location on the hills of <a href="/wiki/Berkeley%2C_California.html" title="Berkeley, California">Berkeley, California</a>. In <a href="/wiki/1949.html" title="1949">1949</a>, <a href="/wiki/Edward_Teller.html" title="Edward Teller">Edward Teller</a> suggested to <a href="/wiki/Ernest_Lawrence.html" title="Ernest Lawrence">Ernest Lawrence</a>, head of the Berkeley lab (now known as the <a href="/wiki/Lawrence_Berkeley_National_Laboratory.html" title="Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory">Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory</a> LBNL), that a second weapons lab be created as "competition" with the lab which sprung up to create the first <a href="/wiki/Atomic_bomb.html" title="Atomic bomb">atomic bomb</a>, <a href="/wiki/Los_Alamos_National_Laboratory.html" title="Los Alamos National Laboratory">Los Alamos</a>. Teller's advocacy for the lab was also in response to his frustrations with the low-priority he felt his idea of a <a href="/wiki/Hydrogen_bomb.html" title="Hydrogen bomb">hydrogen bomb</a> was getting at Los Alamos. In <a href="/wiki/1951.html" title="1951">1951</a>, Teller formally appealed to the <a href="/wiki/Atomic_Energy_Commission.html" title="Atomic Energy Commission">Atomic Energy Commission</a> for the creation of the laboratory, and in September <a href="/wiki/1952.html" title="1952">1952</a> the lab was formally founded as the Livermore branch of the University of California Radiation Laboratory (Lawrence's lab in Berkeley). Despite Teller's original motivation, however, the hydrogen bomb was primarily designed at Los Alamos.</p>
<p>32-year old <a href="/wiki/Herbert_York.html" title="Herbert York">Herbert York</a> was appointed the first director of the lab. York set out to develop the Lab's program and created four main elements: <a href="/wiki/Project_Sherwood.html" title="Project Sherwood">Project Sherwood</a> (the Magnetic Fusion Program), diagnostic weapon experiments (both for Los Alamos and Livermore), the design of thermonuclear weapons, and a basic physics program. The first two facilities were a building to house the latest electronic computer, a <a href="/wiki/UNIVAC_I.html" title="UNIVAC I">UNIVAC I</a>, and a technology building with a large central bay for lifting heavy equipment.</p>
<p>In 1958, after the death of <a href="/wiki/Ernest_O._Lawrence.html" title="Ernest O. Lawrence">Ernest O. Lawrence</a>, the lab was renamed <b>Lawrence Radiation Laboratory</b>. It would later be renamed to its current name of <b>Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory</b> in 1979.</p>
<p>Throughout the <a href="/wiki/Cold_War.html" title="Cold War">Cold War</a>, Lawrence Livermore competed with Los Alamos to design the nation's nuclear arsenal, as well as perform other science and technology related tasks (some classified, some not). In the early 1990s their weapons work shifted into <a href="/wiki/Stockpile_stewardship.html" title="Stockpile stewardship">stockpile stewardship</a>.</p>
<p>Historically the two UC national laboratories in Berkeley and Livermore named after Ernest O. Lawrence, have had very close relationships on research projects, business operations, and staff. In fact, LLNL was not officially severed administratively from <a href="/wiki/LBNL.html" title="LBNL">LBNL</a> until the early 1970s. To this day, in official planning documents and records, LBNL is designated as "Site 100", LLNL as "Site 200", and LLNL's experimental testing area located near <a href="/wiki/Tracy%2C_California.html" title="Tracy, California">Tracy, California</a> as "Site 300."</p>

<h2>Non-Weapons Projects</h2>
<p>A current project is the "small, sealed, transportable, autonomous reactor" or "<a href="/wiki/SSTAR.html" title="SSTAR">SSTAR</a>". It is designed to be a "world" <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_reactor.html" title="Nuclear reactor">nuclear reactor</a>, that can give countries with smaller or less-well-developed electricity grids a self-contained reactor that would operate for 30 years without refueling and then be retrieved - thus preventing the host nation from accessing any <a href="/wiki/Plutonium.html" title="Plutonium">plutonium</a> created as a by-product of the nuclear reaction.</p>

<p>On June 22, 2006, University of California researchers at LLNL announced that they had devised the world's most powerful software - a scientific application that sustained 207.3 trillion operations per second. This was the equivalent of an online game capable of handling 300 million simultaneous players. The record performance was made at LLNL on the IBM Corp's BlueGene/L, the world's fastest supercomputer, which has 131,072 processors. The record was a milestone in the evolution of predictive science, a field in which researchers use supercomputers to answer questions about such subjects as; materials science simulations, global warming, and reactions to natural disasters.</p>

<li>According to published reports the lab has about 880 pounds of <a href="/wiki/Plutonium.html" title="Plutonium">plutonium</a> and is allowed to have up to about 3,080 pounds. However, it is not allowed to have actual <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_weapon.html" title="Nuclear weapon">nuclear weapons</a> or <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_explosive.html" title="Nuclear explosive">nuclear explosive</a> devices at its sites.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Plutonium at the lab is stored in a fortified research facility guarded by a large force of heavily armed and specially trained University of California <a href="/wiki/Security_police.html" title="Security police">security police</a> officers.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>In Livermore and at two facilities in Nevada, the lab uses plutonium for nuclear weapons research. It conducts experiments to learn how plutonium performs as it ages; how it behaves under high pressure, such as with the impact of high explosives; and how to dismantle nuclear weapons safely, without causing contamination.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>In early 2006 the U.S. Department of Energy announced plans to move all the plutonium from Lawrence Livermore Laboratory by 2014, though transfers of the material could start sooner. By 2022, all U.S. work involving plutonium would be consolidated at a single new facility whose location has not been determined.</li>
