<p>A <b>typewriter</b> is a <a href="/wiki/Machine.html" title="Machine">mechanical</a>, <a href="/wiki/Electromechanical.html" title="Electromechanical">electromechanical</a>, or <a href="/wiki/Electronics.html" title="Electronics">electronic</a> device with a set of "keys" that, when pressed, cause characters to be printed on a <a href="/wiki/Document.html" title="Document">document</a>, usually <a href="/wiki/Paper.html" title="Paper">paper</a>.</p>
<p>In the late 19th and the start of the 20th century a person who operated such a device was sometimes also called a <i>typewriter</i> but it then became more common to call the person a <b>typist</b>.</p>
<p>Though now the typewriter may seem rather dated, it was once very useful. A typewriter has a <a href="/wiki/Typewriter_keyboard.html" title="Typewriter keyboard">keyboard</a>, with keys for each of the characters in its <a href="/wiki/Typeface.html" title="Typeface">font</a>. The method by which the typewriter actually marks the paper now varies as greatly as types of <a href="/wiki/Computer_printer.html" title="Computer printer">computer printers</a> do, but until the end of the 20th century was by the impact of a metal (or, later, metallized <a href="/wiki/Plastic.html" title="Plastic">plastic</a>) type element against an "inked" ribbon which caused ink to be deposited on the paper. When multiple copies are necessary, <a href="/wiki/Carbon_paper.html" title="Carbon paper">carbon paper</a> is inserted between multiple pieces of paper, so the type impression is transmitted to multiple layers of paper.</p>
<p>Today in developed countries, typewriters are most commonly used in offices for typing applications for which a computer would be impractical or inconvenient, such as filling out forms and addressing envelopes.<sup title="The text in the vicinity of this tag needs citation." class="noprint">[<a  title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><i>citation&#160;needed</i></a>]</sup> They are also popular with a few writers and in less developed countries. However, in recent years, scanners have made it possible to use the computer to fill out forms, and certain word processors have a tool for addressing envelopes. However, generally typewriters have been replaced by <a href="/wiki/Word_processor.html" title="Word processor">word processor</a> applications on <a href="/wiki/Personal_computer.html" title="Personal computer">personal computers</a>.</p>
<p>Current manufacturers of typewriters include <a href="/wiki/Smith_Corona.html" title="Smith Corona">Smith-Corona</a>, <a href="/wiki/Olivetti.html" title="Olivetti">Olivetti</a>, <a href="/wiki/Royal_Typewriter_Company.html" title="Royal Typewriter Company">Adler-Royal</a>, <a  class="new" title="Olympia Business Systems">Olympia</a>, <a href="/wiki/Brother_Industries.html" title="Brother Industries">Brother</a>, and Nakajima. Olivetti is the only western company to currently manufacture manual typewriters. All other current models are electronic.</p>

<h2>Innovations</h2>
<p>No one person can be said to have invented the typewriter.

In 1714 <a href="/wiki/Henry_Mill.html" title="Henry Mill">Henry Mill</a> obtained a patent in Britain for a machine that from the patent sounds similar to a typewriter, but nothing further is known.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a  title="">[1]</a></sup> Other early developers of writing machines include <a  class="new" title="Pellegrino Turri">Pellegrino Turri</a> (1808) who also invented <a href="/wiki/Carbon_paper.html" title="Carbon paper">carbon paper</a>. Many of these earliest machines, including Turri's, were developed to allow the blind to write.</p>

</div>
<p>In 1829 <a href="/wiki/William_Austin_Burt.html" title="William Austin Burt">William Austin Burt</a> patented a machine called the "Typographer." Like many of these other early machines, it is sometimes listed as the "first typewriter"; the <a href="/wiki/Science_Museum_%28London%29.html" title="Science Museum (London)">Science Museum (London)</a> describes it merely as "the first writing mechanism whose invention was documented," but even that claim may be excessive since Turri's machine is well known.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a  title="">[2]</a></sup> Even in the hands of its inventor it was slower than handwriting. Burt and his promoter <a  class="new" title="John D. Sheldon">John D. Sheldon</a> never found a buyer for the patent, and it was never commercially produced. Because it used a dial to select the character instead of having an individual key for each character, it was an "index typewriter" rather than a "keyboard typewriter", if it is to be considered a typewriter at all. From 1829 to 1870, many printing or typing machines were patented by inventors in Europe and America, but none went into commercial production. Charles Thurber developed multiple patents; his first in 1843 was developed as an aid to the blind. See <a  class="new" title="Charles Thurber">Charles Thurber</a>'s <a href="/wiki/1845.html" title="1845">1845</a> <a  class="new" title="Chirographer">Chirographer</a>, as an example.</p>
<p>In 1855 the <a href="/wiki/Italy.html" title="Italy">Italian</a> <a  class="new" title="Giuseppe Ravizza">Giuseppe Ravizza</a> created a prototype typewriter called " Cembalo scrivano o macchina da scrivere a tasti". It was an advanced machine which let the user see the writing as it was typed.</p>

<p>Father <a  class="new" title="Francisco João de Azevedo">Francisco João de Azevedo</a>, a Brazilian priest, made his own typewriter in 1861 with poor materials, such as wood and knives. <a href="/wiki/Pedro_I_of_Brazil.html" title="Pedro I of Brazil">D.

<p>The <a href="/wiki/Austria.html" title="Austria">Austrian</a> <a  class="new" title="Peter Mitterhofer">Peter Mitterhofer</a> created a typewriter in 1864 but it was never produced commercially. Mitterhofer continued to improve his original model and created 5 different enhanced typewriters until 1868. In 1865 Rev. <a  class="new" title="Malling Hansen">Malling Hansen</a> of <a href="/wiki/Denmark.html" title="Denmark">Denmark</a> produced the <a href="/wiki/Hansen_Writing_Ball.html" title="Hansen Writing Ball">Hansen Writing Ball</a> which went into commercial production in 1870 and was the first commercially sold typewriter. It was a success in Europe and was reported being used in offices in London as late as 1909.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a  title="">[4]</a></sup> Additionally, Hansen used a <a href="/wiki/Solenoid.html" title="Solenoid">solenoid</a> escapement to return the carriage on some of his models, and was responsible for the first "electric" typewriter.</p>

<p>In 1867 <a href="/wiki/Christopher_Sholes.html" title="Christopher Sholes">Christopher Sholes</a>, <a href="/wiki/Carlos_Glidden.html" title="Carlos Glidden">Carlos Glidden</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Samuel_W._Soule.html" title="Samuel W. Soule">Samuel W. Soule</a> invented another typewriter. The Sholes and Glidden typewriter was the first device that allowed an operator to type substantially faster than a person could write by hand. The patent (US 79,265) was sold for $12,000 to <a  class="new" title="Densmore and Yost">Densmore and Yost</a>, who made an agreement with <a href="/wiki/E._Remington_and_Sons.html" title="E. Remington and Sons">E. Remington and Sons</a> (then famous as a manufacturer of <a href="/wiki/Sewing_machine.html" title="Sewing machine">sewing machines</a>), to commercialize what was known as the <i>Sholes and Glidden Type-Writer</i>. Remington started production of their first typewriter on <a href="/wiki/March_1.html" title="March 1">March 1</a>, <a href="/wiki/1873.html" title="1873">1873</a> in <a href="/wiki/Ilion%2C_New_York.html" title="Ilion, New York">Ilion</a>, <a href="/wiki/New_York.html" title="New York">New York</a>. Another early typewriter manufacturer was <a href="/wiki/Underwood_%28typewriter%29.html" title="Underwood (typewriter)">Underwood</a>.</p>
<p>The ability to view what is typed as it is typed is taken for granted today. In all early keyboard typewriters, however, the <a href="/wiki/Typebar.html" title="Typebar">typebars</a> struck upwards against the bottom of the <a href="/wiki/Platen.html" title="Platen">platen</a>. Thus, what was typed was not visible until the typing of subsequent lines caused it to scroll into view. The difficulty with any other arrangement was ensuring that the typebars fell back into place reliably when the key was released. This was eventually achieved with ingenious mechanical designs, and so-called "visible typewriters" were introduced in 1895. Surprisingly, the older style continued in production as late as 1915.</p>

<p>In the original design style, now known as a "mechanical" or "manual" typewriter, each key was attached to a <a href="/wiki/Typebar.html" title="Typebar">typebar</a> that had the corresponding letter molded into its other end. When a key was struck briskly and firmly, the typebar hit a ribbon (usually made of <a href="/wiki/Ink.html" title="Ink">inked</a> <a href="/wiki/Cloth.html" title="Cloth">fabric</a>) stretched in front of a cylindrical platen that moved back and forth. The paper was rolled around by the typewriter's platen which was then rotated by a lever (the "carriage return" lever at the far left) to each new line of text. Some ribbons were inked in black and red, each a stripe half the width and the entire length of the ribbon. A lever on most machines allowed switching between colors for typing bookkeeping entries, where negative amounts had to be in red.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Electric designs">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Electric_designs" id="Electric_designs"></a></p>
<h2>Electric designs</h2>
<p>Electrical typewriter designs removed the <i>direct</i> mechanical connection between the keys and the element that struck the paper. Not to be confused with later <i>electronic</i> typewriters, electric typewriters contained only a single electrical component in them, the motor. Where the keystroke had previously moved a typebar directly, now it engaged mechanical linkages that directed mechanical power from the motor into the typebar. This was also true of the forthcoming IBM Selectric.</p>
<p>IBM and Remington electric typewriters were the leading models until IBM introduced the <a href="/wiki/IBM_Selectric_typewriter.html" title="IBM Selectric typewriter">IBM Selectric typewriter</a>, which replaced the typebars with a spherical typeball (more correctly, "element"), slightly larger than a golf ball, with the letters molded on its surface. The Selectric used a system of latches, metal tapes, and pulleys driven by an electric motor to rotate the ball into the correct position and then strike it against the ribbon and platen. The typeball moved laterally in front of the paper instead of the former platen-carrying carriage moving the paper across a stationary print position.</p>
<div class="thumb tleft">
<div style="width:182px;"><a  class="internal" title="replaceable IBM typeballs with clip, 2 Euro coin to compare"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/92/IBM_Selectric_Globe_Wiki.jpg/180px-IBM_Selectric_Globe_Wiki.jpg" alt="replaceable IBM typeballs with clip, 2 Euro coin to compare" width="180" height="125" longdesc="/wiki/Image:IBM_Selectric_Globe_Wiki.jpg" /></a>

</div>
<p>The typeball design had many advantages, especially in eliminating of "jams" when more than one key was struck at once, and in the ability to change the typeball, allowing multiple fonts to be used in a single document. Selectric mechanisms were widely incorporated into computer terminals in the 1970s, because the typing mechanism was reasonably fast and jam-free; could produce very high quality output compared to competitors such as <a href="/wiki/Teletype.html" title="Teletype">Teletype</a> machines, could be initiated by a short, low-force mechanical action; did not require the movement of a heavy "type basket" in order to shift between lower- and upper-case; and did not require the platen roller assembly to move from side to side (which would be a problem with continuous-feed paper). The IBM 2741 terminal was a very popular example of a Selectric-based computer terminal, and similar mechanisms were employed as the console devices for many IBM System/360 computers. These mechanisms did use "ruggedized" designs compared to those in standard commercial typewriters.</p>
<p>Later models of IBM Executives and Selectrics replaced inked fabric ribbons with "carbon film" ribbons that had a dry black or colored powder on a "once-through" clear plastic tape. These could be used only once but later models used a cartridge that was simple to replace. A side effect of this technology is that the text typed on the machine can be easily read from the used ribbon. This "feature" raised issues where the machines were used for preparing classified documents; ribbons had to be accounted for to ensure that typists didn't walk out with them in pockets or purses. A document reconstructed from a used carbon ribbon was portrayed as the key to solving a crime in an episode of <a href="/wiki/Columbo.html" title="Columbo">Columbo</a>.</p>

<p>A variation known as "Correcting Selectrics" introduced correction, where a sticky tape in front of the print ribbon could remove the black-powdered image of a typed character, and introduced selectable "pitch" so that the typewriter could be switched among pica ("10 pitch", or 10 characters per inch) and elite ("12 pitch"), even in one document. Even so, all Selectrics were <a href="/wiki/Typeface#Proportion.html" title="Typeface">monospaced</a>—each and every character was alloted the same horizontal space on the page. Although IBM had produced a successful typebar-based machine, the <a href="/wiki/IBM_Executive_series_typewriter.html" title="IBM Executive series typewriter">IBM Executive</a>, with proportional spacing, no proportionally spaced Selectric office typewriter was ever introduced. There was, however, a much more expensive proportionally spaced machine called the <a  class="new" title="Selectric Composer">Selectric Composer</a> which was capable of right-margin justification and so was considered a <a href="/wiki/Typesetter.html" title="Typesetter">typesetting machine</a> rather than a typewriter, and the more reasonably priced IBM Electronic Typewriter 50, which was capable of proportional spacing but not justifying.</p>
<p>The final major development of the typewriter was the "electronic" typewriter. Most of these replaced the typeball with a <a href="/wiki/Daisy_wheel.html" title="Daisy wheel">daisy wheel</a> mechanism (a disk with the letters molded on the outside edge of the "petals"). A plastic daisy-wheel was much simpler and cheaper than the typeball but wore out more easily. Some electronic typewriters were in essence dedicated <a href="/wiki/Word_processor.html" title="Word processor">word processors</a> with internal memory and cartridge or diskette external memory-storage devices. Unlike the Selectrics and earlier models, these really were "electronic" and relied on integrated circuits and multiple electromechanical components.</p>

<h2>Non-impact technologies</h2>
<p>Towards the end of the commercial popularity of typewriters in the 1980s, a number of hybrid designs combining features of <a href="/wiki/Computer_printer.html" title="Computer printer">computer printers</a> and typewriters were introduced.</p>
<p>These typically incorporated keyboards from existing models of typewriters and the printing mechanism of <a href="/wiki/Dot-matrix_printer.html" title="Dot-matrix printer">dot-matrix printers</a>. The generation of <a href="/wiki/Teletype.html" title="Teletype">teletypes</a> with impact pin-based printing engines was not adequate for the demanding quality required for typed output. Newly developed, <a  class="new" title="Thermal transfer">thermal transfer</a> technologies used in thermal <a href="/wiki/Label_printer.html" title="Label printer">label printers</a> had become technically feasible for typewriters.</p>

<p>The development of these proprietary printing engines provided the vendors with exclusive markets in consumable ribbons and the possibility to use standardised printing engines with varying degrees of electronic and software sophistication to develop product lines.</p>
<p>The increasing dominance of <a href="/wiki/Personal_computer.html" title="Personal computer">personal computers</a> and the introduction of low-cost, truly high-quality, <a href="/wiki/Laser_printer.html" title="Laser printer">laser</a> and <a href="/wiki/Inkjet_printer.html" title="Inkjet printer">inkjet printer</a> technologies are replacing typewriters.</p>

However, in recent years forms have become able to be filled out on a computer (after being scanned to a program) and also online. They are also used by people without access to, or the training to use a computer. The monospaced, stark, and slightly uneven look of typewritten text can have some artistic appeal, and some people, young or old, prefer to use a typewriter.</p>

<p>In some countries where personal computers are not ubiquitous, one may go to the public square and find individuals who gather there with their old but sturdy typewriters.

<h3>Keyboard layout</h3>
<p>The 1874 Sholes &amp; Glidden typewriters established the <a href="/wiki/QWERTY.html" title="QWERTY">QWERTY</a> layout for the letter keys. During the period in which Sholes and his colleagues were experimenting with this invention, other keyboard arrangements were apparently tried, but these are poorly documented. The tantalizing near-alphabetical sequence on the "home row" of the QWERTY layout (d-f-g-h-j-k-l) demonstrates that a straightforward alphabetical arrangement was the original starting point <sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a  title="">[5]</a></sup>. The QWERTY layout of keys has become the <a href="/wiki/De_facto.html" title="De facto">de facto</a> standard for English-language typewriter and computer keyboards. Other languages written in the <a href="/wiki/Latin_alphabet.html" title="Latin alphabet">Latin alphabet</a> may use variants of the QWERTY layouts, such as the French <a href="/wiki/AZERTY.html" title="AZERTY">AZERTY</a>, the Italian <a href="/wiki/QZERTY.html" title="QZERTY">QZERTY</a>, the German <a href="/wiki/QWERTZ.html" title="QWERTZ">QWERTZ</a>, and the Portuguese <a href="/wiki/HCESAR.html" title="HCESAR">HCESAR</a> layouts.</p>
<p>The QWERTY layout is certainly far from the most efficient, since it requires a touch-typist to move his or her fingers between rows to type the most common letters. A popular story suggests that it was used for early typewriters <i>because</i> it was inefficient; it slowed a typist down so as to reduce the frequency of the typewriter's typebars from wedging together and jamming the machine. A more likely explanation is that the QWERTY arrangement was designed to reduce the likelihood of internal clashing by placing commonly used combinations of letters farther away from each other inside the machine <sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a  title="">[6]</a></sup>. This allowed the user to actually type faster without jamming. Unfortunately, no definitive explanation for the QWERTY keyboard has been found, and typewriter aficionados continue to debate the issue.</p>
<p>A number of radically different layouts, such as the <a href="/wiki/Dvorak_Simplified_Keyboard.html" title="Dvorak Simplified Keyboard">Dvorak keyboard</a>, have been proposed to reduce the perceived inefficiencies of QWERTY, but these have not been able to displace the QWERTY layout; their proponents claim considerable advantages, but so far inertia has prevented any mainstream adoption. The <a href="/wiki/Blickensderfer_typewriter.html" title="Blickensderfer typewriter">Blickensderfer typewriter</a> with its DHIATENSOR layout may have possibly been the first attempt at optimizing the keyboard layout for efficiency advantages.</p>
<p>Many old typewriters do not contain a separate key for the numeral 1, and some even older ones also lack the numeral zero. Typists learned the habit of using the lowercase letter l for the digit 1, and the uppercase O for the zero. Some still carry the habit of using the letter l instead of the numeral 1 with them when typing on a computer, sometimes leading to errors, especially when working with numerical <a href="/wiki/Data.html" title="Data">data</a>.<sup title="The text in the vicinity of this tag needs citation." class="noprint">[<a  title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><i>citation&#160;needed</i></a>]</sup></p>

<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Correction methods">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Correction_methods" id="Correction_methods"></a></p>
<h2>Correction methods</h2>
<p>According to the standards taught in secretarial schools in the mid-<a href="/wiki/1900s.html" title="1900s">1900s</a>, a <a href="/wiki/Business_letter.html" title="Business letter">business letter</a> was supposed to have no mistakes and no visible corrections. Accuracy was, therefore, prized as much as speed. Indeed, typing speeds, as scored in proficiency tests and typewriting speed competitions, included a deduction of ten words for every mistake that was made.</p>
<p>Corrections were, of course, necessary, and a variety of methods and technologies were used.</p>
<p>The traditional method involved the use of a special typewriter eraser. The typewriter eraser was made of fairly hard, stiff rubber, containing abrasive material. It was in the shape of a thin, flat disk, approx. 2 inches (50 mm) in diameter by 1/8 inch (3 mm) thick allowing for the erasure of individual typed letters. Business letters were typed on heavyweight, high-rag-content bond paper, not merely to provide a luxurious appearance, but also to stand up to erasure. Typewriter erasers were equipped with a brush for brushing away eraser crumbs and paper dust, and using the brush properly was an important element of typewriting skill, because if erasure detritus fell into the typewriter, a very small buildup could cause the typebars to jam in their narrow supporting grooves.</p>
<p>Erasing a set of carbon copies was particularly difficult, and called for the use of a device called an <i>eraser shield</i> to prevent the pressure of erasure on the upper copies from producing carbon smudges on the lower copies.</p>
<p>Paper companies produced a special form of typewriter paper called <i>erasable bond</i> (for example, <a href="/wiki/Eaton%27s_Corrasable_Bond.html" title="Eaton's Corrasable Bond">Eaton's Corrasable Bond</a>). This incorporated a thin layer of material that prevented ink from penetrating and was relatively soft and easy to remove from the page. An ordinary soft pencil eraser could quickly produce perfect erasures on this kind of paper. However, the same characteristics that made the paper erasable made the characters subject to smudging due to ordinary friction and deliberate alteration after the fact, making it unacceptable for business correspondence, contracts, or any archival use.</p>
<p>In the fifties and sixties, <a href="/wiki/Correction_fluid.html" title="Correction fluid">correction fluid</a> made its appearance, under brand names such as <a href="/wiki/Liquid_Paper.html" title="Liquid Paper">Liquid Paper</a>, <a href="/wiki/Wite-Out.html" title="Wite-Out">Wite-Out</a> and <a href="/wiki/Tipp-Ex.html" title="Tipp-Ex">Tipp-Ex</a>. This was a kind of opaque white fast-drying paint which produced a fresh white surface onto which a correction could be re-typed. However, when held to the light, the covered-up characters were visible, as was the patch of dry correction fluid (which was never perfectly flat, and never a perfect match for the color, texture, and luster of the surrounding paper). The standard trick for solving this problem was <a href="/wiki/Photocopying.html" title="Photocopying">photocopying</a> the corrected page, but this was possible only with high quality photocopiers, and was not practical with color letterheads. (However, high quality typists were smart enough to place the color letterhead stock in the copier, and photocopy the corrected typed-text-only-on-plain-paper document onto the color letterhead!)</p>
<p>Dry correction products (such as <a href="/wiki/Correction_paper.html" title="Correction paper">correction paper</a>) under brand names such as <i>Ko-Rec-Type</i> were introduced in the seventies and functioned like white carbon paper. A strip of the product was placed over the letters needing correction, and the incorrect letters were retyped, causing the black character to be overstruck with a white overcoat. Similar material was soon incorporated in carbon-film electric typewriter ribbons; like the traditional two-color black-and-red inked ribbon common on manual typewriters, a black/white correcting ribbon became commonplace on electric typewriters.</p>
<p>The pinnacle of this kind of technology was the <a href="/wiki/IBM.html" title="IBM">IBM</a> Electronic Typewriter series. These machines, and similar products from other manufacturers, used a separate correction ribbon and a character memory. With a single keystroke, the typewriter was capable of automatically reversing and overstriking the previous characters. White cover-up or plastic lift-off correction ribbons are used with fabric ink or carbon film typing ribbons, respectively.</p>

<h2>Typing speed records and speed contests</h2>
<p>During the 1920s through 1940s, typing speed was an important secretarial qualification and typing contests were popular, publicized by typewriter companies as promotional tools.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/As_of_2005.html" title="As of 2005">As of 2005</a>, Barbara Blackburn is the fastest typist in the world, according to <a href="/wiki/The_Guinness_Book_of_World_Records.html" title="The Guinness Book of World Records">The Guinness Book of World Records</a>. Using the <a href="/wiki/Dvorak_Simplified_Keyboard.html" title="Dvorak Simplified Keyboard">Dvorak Simplified Keyboard</a>, she has maintained 150 word/min for 50 min, 170 word/min for shorter periods of time, and has been clocked at a peak speed of 212 word/min. Blackburn, who failed her typing class in high school, first encountered the Dvorak keyboard in 1938, quickly learned to achieve very high speeds, and occasionally toured giving speed-typing demonstrations during her secretarial career. She appeared on <i><a href="/wiki/The_David_Letterman_Show.html" title="The David Letterman Show">The David Letterman Show</a></i> and was deeply offended by <a href="/wiki/David_Letterman.html" title="David Letterman">Letterman's</a> comedic treatment of her skill.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a  title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>Due to popular software named "<a href="/wiki/Mavis_Beacon_Teaches_Typing.html" title="Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing">Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing</a>", many people have assumed that there is a woman named Mavis Beacon who is a very good typist. In reality, Mavis Beacon is a fictional promotional character.</p>
<p>Today with the help of technology, fast typists are gathering together for an online competition updated weekly on <sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a  title="">[8]</a></sup>. At the beginning of the week the average would be approximately 80 <a href="/wiki/Words_per_minute.html" title="Words per minute">words per minute</a>. By the end of the week the average would be over 160 Words per Minute with the average peak of over 220 words per minute.</p>

<h2>Forensic identification</h2>
<p>Because of the tolerances of the mechanical parts, slight variation in the alignment of the letters and their uneven wear, each typewriter has its individual "signature" or "<a href="/wiki/Fingerprint_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Fingerprint (disambiguation)">fingerprint</a>", allowing a typewritten document to be <a href="/wiki/Forensic_identification.html" title="Forensic identification">tracked back</a> to the typewriter it was produced on.
