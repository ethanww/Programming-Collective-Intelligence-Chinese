<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Initial planning and development for Multics started in <a href="/wiki/1964.html" title="1964">1964</a>. Originally it was a cooperative project led by <a href="/wiki/Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology.html" title="Massachusetts Institute of Technology">MIT</a> (with <a href="/wiki/Fernando_Corbat%C3%B3.html" title="Fernando Corbató">Fernando Corbató</a>), along with <a href="/wiki/General_Electric.html" title="General Electric">General Electric</a> and <a href="/wiki/Bell_Labs.html" title="Bell Labs">Bell Labs</a>. Bell Labs dropped out in <a href="/wiki/1969.html" title="1969">1969</a>, and in <a href="/wiki/1970.html" title="1970">1970</a> GE's computer business, including Multics, was taken over by <a href="/wiki/Honeywell.html" title="Honeywell">Honeywell</a>.</p>
<p>Multics was conceived as a commercial product for GE, and it did achieve that for Honeywell, although it was not a very successful one. However, it had a powerful impact in the computer field, due to its many novel and valuable ideas. Although it was much derided at the time by its critics <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.multicians.org/myths.html">[1]</a>, history has shown these complaints to be <a href="/wiki/Canard_%28computing%29.html" title="Canard (computing)">canards</a>.</p>
<p>It had numerous features intended to result in high availability, so that it would produce a <a  class="new" title="Computing utility">computing utility</a>, similar to the <a href="/wiki/Telephone.html" title="Telephone">telephone</a> and <a href="/wiki/Electricity.html" title="Electricity">electricity</a> services. To achieve this, in addition to being modular in software structure, the hardware was too, and the system could grow in size by simply adding more of the appropriate resource - computing power, main memory, disk storage, etc. Separate <a href="/wiki/Access_Control_List.html" title="Access Control List">Access Control Lists</a> on every file provided flexible information sharing, but also provided complete privacy when needed. It contained a number of standard mechanisms to allow engineers to analyze the performance of the system, as well as a number of adaptive performance optimization mechanisms.</p>

<h2>Novel ideas</h2>
<p>Multics was an early operating system that implemented a <a  class="new" title="Single level store">single level store</a> for data access, discarding the clear distinction between <a href="/wiki/Computer_file.html" title="Computer file">files</a> (called <i>segments</i> in Multics) and <i><a href="/wiki/Computer_process.html" title="Computer process">process</a> <a href="/wiki/Computer_memory.html" title="Computer memory">memory</a></i>. The memory of a process consisted solely of segments which were mapped into its <a href="/wiki/Address_space.html" title="Address space">address space</a>; to read or write to them, the process simply used normal <a href="/wiki/Central_processing_unit.html" title="Central processing unit">CPU</a> instructions, and the operating system took care of making sure that all the modifications were saved to <a href="/wiki/Disk_storage.html" title="Disk storage">disk</a>. In <a href="/wiki/POSIX.html" title="POSIX">POSIX</a> terminology, it was as if every file was <code><a href="/wiki/Mmap.html" title="Mmap">mmap</a>()</code>ed; however, in Multics there was no concept of <i>process memory</i>, separate from the memory used to hold mapped in files, as Unix has. <i>All</i> memory in the system was part of <i>some</i> segment, which appeared in the <a href="/wiki/File_system.html" title="File system">file system</a>; this included the temporary scratch memory of the process, its kernel stack, etc.</p>
<p>(One disadvantage of this in practice, due only to the particular hardware architecture of the particular machines it ran on, and not a result of the basic concept, was that the size of segments was limited to 256K 36-bit words, roughly equal to 1 megabyte by today's standards, and therefore extra code had to be used to work on files larger than this, called multi-segment files. In the days before large databases and, later, huge <a href="/wiki/Bitmap.html" title="Bitmap">bitmap</a> graphics, this limit was rarely encountered.)</p>
<p>This led to the second of Multics' major new ideas, <a href="/wiki/Shared_library.html" title="Shared library">dynamic linking</a>, in which a running process could request that other segments be added to its address space, segments which could contain code that it could then execute. With this facility available, applications automatically used the latest version of any external routine they called, since those routines were kept in other segments, which were dynamically linked in only when a process first tried to begin execution in them. Since different processes, belonging to different users, could use different <a  class="new" title="Search rules">search rules</a>, different users could end up using different versions of external routines automatically. Equally importantly, with the appropriate settings on the Multics security facilities, the code in the other segment could then gain access to data structures maintained in a different process.</p>
<p>Thus, to interact with an application running in part as a <a href="/wiki/Daemon_%28computer_software%29.html" title="Daemon (computer software)">daemon</a> (in another process), a user's process simply performed a normal procedure call instruction, to a code segment which it had dynamically linked to (a code segment which implemented some operation associated with the daemon). The code in that segment could then modify data maintained and used in the daemon. When the action necessary to commence the request was completed, a simple procedure return instruction returned control of the user's process to the user's code.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that these two ideas, in their full power, are even now still not available in other widely used operating systems, despite the rapid and otherwise enormous advance in the computer field since the <a href="/wiki/1960s.html" title="1960s">1960s</a>; although in more limited forms they are now becoming more widely accepted and available, e.g. dynamic linking.</p>
<p>Multics also supported extremely aggressive on-line reconfiguration; <a href="/wiki/Central_processing_unit.html" title="Central processing unit">CPUs</a>, memory banks, disk drives, etc. could all be added and removed while the system continued operating; being added into service, or removed from it, as required. (In fact, it was common practice at the MIT system, where most early software development was done, to split the system — which was a multi-processor system — into two separate systems during off-hours by incrementally removing enough components to form a second working system, leaving the rest still running the original logged-in users. System software development testing could be performed on the second machine; when testing was over, the components of the second system would be added back onto the main user system, without ever having shut it down.) Since multiple CPUs were supported, it was thus one of the earliest multi-processor systems.</p>
<p>Multics was also notable for its early emphasis on <a href="/wiki/Computer_security.html" title="Computer security">computer security</a> by design, and Multics was possibly the very first operating system to be designed as a secure system from the ground up. In spite of this, early versions of Multics were broken into, not once, but repeatedly. This led to further work on improved security that both prefigured modern <a href="/wiki/Security_engineering.html" title="Security engineering">security engineering</a> techniques, and made the system much more secure; once the second-generation hardware base was adopted, with hardware support for <a href="/wiki/Ring_%28computer_security%29.html" title="Ring (computer security)">ring-oriented security</a> (a multi-level refinement of the concept of <a href="/wiki/Kernel_mode.html" title="Kernel mode">master mode</a>), break-ins became very rare.</p>
<p>In addition to having been the first operating system to provide a hierarchical file system, filenames could be of almost arbitrary length and syntax; a given file or directory could have multiple names (typically a long and short form); and symbolic links between directories were also supported. It was the first to use the now-standard concept of having per-<a href="/wiki/Process_%28computing%29.html" title="Process (computing)">process</a> <a href="/wiki/Stack_%28data_structure%29.html" title="Stack (data structure)">stacks</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Kernel_%28computers%29.html" title="Kernel (computers)">kernel</a>, with a separate stack for each security ring. It was also one of the first written in a high level language; <a href="/wiki/PLI.html" title="PLI">PL/I</a> was used, though the <a href="/wiki/Burroughs_B5000.html" title="Burroughs B5000">Burroughs B5000</a> system, which used <a href="/wiki/ALGOL.html" title="ALGOL">ALGOL</a>, preceded Multics.</p>

<h2>Project history</h2>
<p>Multics was developed initially for the <a href="/wiki/GE-645.html" title="GE-645">GE-645</a> mainframe, a 36-bit system; later, it was supported on the <a href="/wiki/Honeywell_6180.html" title="Honeywell 6180">Honeywell 6180</a> series machines.</p>
<p>Bell Labs pulled out of the project in <a href="/wiki/1969.html" title="1969">1969</a>; some of the people who had worked on it there went on to create the <a href="/wiki/Unix.html" title="Unix">Unix</a> system. Superficially, UNIX shows the influence of Multics in many areas, down to the naming of commands. The design philosophy was quite different, however, focusing on keeping the system as small and as simplistic as possible, and thus correcting what was seen as the deficiencies of Multics. The name "Unix" (originally "Unics") is itself a <a href="/wiki/Hack_%28technology_slang%29.html" title="Hack (technology slang)">hack</a> on "Multics". The U in UNIX is rumoured to stand for "Uniplexed" as opposed to the "Multiplexed" of Multics, further underscoring the designers' rejections of Multics' complexity in favour of a more straightforward and workable approach.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Honeywell.html" title="Honeywell">Honeywell</a> bought G.E.'s computer division, released a better hardware base, and continued system development until <a href="/wiki/1985.html" title="1985">1985</a>. About 80 multi-million-dollar sites were installed, at universities, industry, and government sites. The <a href="/wiki/France.html" title="France">French</a> university system had quite a few in the early <a href="/wiki/1980s.html" title="1980s">1980s</a>. After Honeywell stopped supporting Multics, users migrated to other systems including the Unix system.</p>
<p>The last Multics machine was shut down on <a href="/wiki/October_31.html" title="October 31">October 31</a>, <a href="/wiki/2000.html" title="2000">2000</a> at the Canadian Department of National Defence.</p>

<p><a name="Retrospective_observations" id="Retrospective_observations"></a></p>
<h2>Retrospective observations</h2>
<p>It is more than a little startling to realize that the permanently resident kernel of this powerful multi-processor mainframe <i>computing utility</i>, much derided in its day as being too large and too complex, was a mere 135 <a href="/wiki/Kilobyte.html" title="Kilobyte">Kbytes</a> of code. The first <a href="/wiki/MIT.html" title="MIT">MIT</a> GE-645 had 512K words of memory (2 <a href="/wiki/Megabyte.html" title="Megabyte">Mbytes</a>), so the kernel only used a moderate portion of Multics main memory.</p>
<p>Measured another way, the entire system, including not just the operating system, but also the complex PL/I compiler, user commands, and subroutine libraries, consisted of about 1500 total source modules. These averaged roughly 200 lines of source code each, and <a href="/wiki/Compile.html" title="Compile">compiled</a> to produce a total of roughly 4.5 <a href="/wiki/Megabyte.html" title="Megabyte">Mbytes</a> of procedure code, which though small today was fairly large by the standards of the day.</p>
<p>Multics compilers generally optimised more for code density than CPU performance, for example using small sub-routines called <i>operators</i> for short standard code-sequences, making direct comparison of object code size with more modern systems less useful. High code density was a good optimisation choice for a multi-user system with expensive main memory, such as Multics.</p>
