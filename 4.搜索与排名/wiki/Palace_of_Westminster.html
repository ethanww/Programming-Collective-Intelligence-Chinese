<p>The <b>Palace of Westminster</b>, also known as the <b>Houses of Parliament</b>, in <a href="/wiki/London.html" title="London">London</a>, <a href="/wiki/England.html" title="England">England</a> is where the two Houses of the <a href="/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom.html" title="Parliament of the United Kingdom">Parliament of the United Kingdom</a> (the <a href="/wiki/House_of_Lords.html" title="House of Lords">House of Lords</a> and the <a href="/wiki/British_House_of_Commons.html" title="British House of Commons">House of Commons</a>) meet to conduct their business.

<p>The oldest part of the Palace still in existence, Westminster Hall, dates from 1097. The <a href="/wiki/Palace.html" title="Palace">palace</a> originally served as a royal residence but no monarch has lived in it since the 16th century. Most of the present structure dates from the 19th century, when the Palace was rebuilt after it was almost entirely destroyed by a fire in 1834. The architect responsible for rebuilding the Palace was <a href="/wiki/Charles_Barry.html" title="Charles Barry">Sir Charles Barry</a> with <a href="/wiki/Augustus_Pugin.html" title="Augustus Pugin">Augustus Welby Pugin</a>. The building is an example of <a href="/wiki/Gothic_revival.html" title="Gothic revival">Gothic revival</a>. One of the Palace's most famous features is the clock tower, a tourist attraction that houses the famous bell <a href="/wiki/Big_Ben.html" title="Big Ben">Big Ben</a>. The latter name is often used, erroneously, for the clock itself, which is actually part of St Stephen's Tower.</p>
<p>The Palace contains over 1,000 rooms, the most important of which are the Chambers of the House of Lords and of the House of Commons. The Palace also includes committee rooms, libraries, lobbies, dining-rooms, bars and gymnasiums. It is the site of important state ceremonies, most notably the <a href="/wiki/State_Opening_of_Parliament.html" title="State Opening of Parliament">State Opening of Parliament</a>. The Palace is very closely associated with the two Houses, as shown by the use of the word "Westminster" to refer to "Parliament". Parliamentary offices overspill into nearby buildings such as <a href="/wiki/Portcullis_House.html" title="Portcullis House">Portcullis House</a>, and Norman Shaw Buildings.</p>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Palace of Westminster was strategically important during the <a href="/wiki/Middle_Ages.html" title="Middle Ages">Middle Ages</a>, as it was located on the banks of the River Thames. Buildings have occupied the site since at least <a href="/wiki/Anglo-Saxons.html" title="Anglo-Saxons">Saxon</a> times. Known in mediæval times as <a href="/wiki/Thorney_Island_%28London%29.html" title="Thorney Island (London)">Thorney Island</a>, the site may have been first used for a royal residence by <a href="/wiki/Canute_the_Great.html" title="Canute the Great">Canute the Great</a> (reigned 1016 to 1035). The penultimate Saxon monarch of England, <a href="/wiki/Edward_the_Confessor.html" title="Edward the Confessor">St Edward the Confessor</a>, built a royal palace in <a href="/wiki/Thorney_Island_%28London%29.html" title="Thorney Island (London)">Thorney Island</a> just west of the City of London at about the same time as he built <a href="/wiki/Westminster_Abbey.html" title="Westminster Abbey">Westminster Abbey</a> (1045 to 1050). Thorney Island and the surrounding area soon became known as Westminster (a contraction of the words "West <a href="/wiki/Monastery.html" title="Monastery">Monastery</a>"). After the <a href="/wiki/Norman_Conquest.html" title="Norman Conquest">Norman Conquest</a> (1066) <a href="/wiki/William_I_of_England.html" title="William I of England">King William I</a> established himself at the <a href="/wiki/Tower_of_London.html" title="Tower of London">Tower of London</a>, but later moved to Westminster. Neither the buildings used by the Saxons nor those used by William I survive. The oldest existing parts of the Palace (Westminster Hall and the Great Hall) date from the reign of William I's successor, <a href="/wiki/William_II_of_England.html" title="William II of England">King William II</a>.</p>
<p>The Palace of Westminster was the monarch's principal residence in the late <a href="/wiki/Mediaeval.html" title="Mediaeval">Mediaeval</a> period. The predecessor of Parliament, the <i><a href="/wiki/Curia_Regis.html" title="Curia Regis">Curia Regis</a></i> (Royal Council), met in Westminster Hall (though it followed the King when he moved to other palaces). The <a href="/wiki/Model_Parliament.html" title="Model Parliament">Model Parliament</a>, the first official Parliament of England, met in the Palace in 1295. Since then, almost all Parliaments have met in the Palace. However, some Parliaments have met in other locations.</p>

<p>Westminster remained the monarch's chief London residence until a fire destroyed part of the structure in 1529. In 1530 <a href="/wiki/Henry_VIII_of_England.html" title="Henry VIII of England">King Henry VIII</a> acquired <a href="/wiki/Palace_of_Whitehall.html" title="Palace of Whitehall">York Palace</a> from <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Cardinal_Wolsey.html" title="Thomas Cardinal Wolsey">Thomas Cardinal Wolsey</a>, a powerful minister who had lost the King's favour. Renaming it the Palace of Whitehall, Henry VIII used it as his principal residence. Although Westminster officially remained a royal palace, it was used by the two Houses of Parliament and as a law court.</p>
<p>Because it was originally a royal residence, the Palace did not include any purpose-built chambers for the two Houses. Important state ceremonies, including the State Opening of Parliament, were held in the Painted Chamber. The House of Lords usually met in the White Chamber. The House of Commons, however, did not have a chamber of its own; it sometimes held its debates in the Chapter House of Westminster Abbey. The Commons acquired a permanent home in the Palace—<a href="/wiki/St_Stephen%27s_Chapel.html" title="St Stephen's Chapel">St Stephen's Chapel</a>, a former royal chapel, but only during the reign of Henry VIII's successor, <a href="/wiki/Edward_VI_of_England.html" title="Edward VI of England">King Edward VI</a>. The Chantries Act 1547 (passed as a part of the <a href="/wiki/Protestant_Reformation.html" title="Protestant Reformation">Protestant Reformation</a>) dissolved the religious order of the Canons of St Stephen's (among other institutions); thus the Chapel was left for the Commons' use. Alterations were made to St Stephen's Chapel for the convenience of the lower House.</p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/October_16.html" title="October 16">16 October</a> <a href="/wiki/1834.html" title="1834">1834</a>, most of the Palace was <a href="/wiki/Burning_of_Parliament.html" title="Burning of Parliament">destroyed by fire</a>. Only Westminster Hall, the <a href="/wiki/Jewel_Tower.html" title="Jewel Tower">Jewel Tower</a>, the crypt of St Stephen's Chapel and the <a href="/wiki/Cloister.html" title="Cloister">cloisters</a> survived. A Royal Commission was appointed to study the rebuilding of the Palace and decided that it should be rebuilt on the same site, and that its style should be either <a href="/wiki/Gothic_architecture.html" title="Gothic architecture">Gothic</a> or <a href="/wiki/Tudor_Style_architecture.html" title="Tudor Style architecture">Elizabethan</a>. A heated public debate over the proposed styles ensued. In 1836, after studying 97 rival proposals, the Royal Commission chose <a href="/wiki/Charles_Barry.html" title="Charles Barry">Charles Barry</a>'s plan for a Gothic style palace. The foundation stone was laid in 1840; the Lords' Chamber was completed in 1847, and the Commons' Chamber in 1852 (at which point Barry received a knighthood). Although most of the work had been carried out by 1860, construction was not finished until a decade afterwards.</p>
<p>The Palace of Westminster continued to function normally until 1940. In <a href="/wiki/1941.html" title="1941">1941</a>, the Commons' Chamber was destroyed by <a href="/wiki/Germany.html" title="Germany">German</a> bombs in the course of the <a href="/wiki/World_War_II.html" title="World War II">Second World War</a>. Sir <a href="/wiki/Giles_Gilbert_Scott.html" title="Giles Gilbert Scott">Giles Gilbert Scott</a> was commissioned as architect for the rebuilding of the Chamber; he chose to preserve the essential features of Sir Charles Barry's design. Work on the Commons' Chamber was completed by 1950.</p>

<h2>Exterior</h2>
<p>Sir Charles Barry's design for the Palace of Westminster uses the Perpendicular Gothic style, which was popular during the 15th century and returned during the Gothic revival of the 19th century. Barry was himself a <a href="/wiki/Classical_architecture.html" title="Classical architecture">classical architect</a>, but he was aided by the Gothic architect <a href="/wiki/Augustus_Pugin.html" title="Augustus Pugin">Augustus Pugin</a>. Westminster Hall, which was built in the 11th century and survived the fire of 1834, was incorporated in Barry's design. Pugin was displeased with the result of the work, especially with the symmetrical layout designed by Barry; he famously remarked, "All Grecian, sir; Tudor details on a classic body."</p>

<p><a name="Stonework" id="Stonework"></a></p>
<h3>Stonework</h3>
<p>The stonework of the building was originally Anston, a sand-coloured magnesian <a href="/wiki/Limestone.html" title="Limestone">limestone</a> quarried in the village of <a href="/wiki/Anston.html" title="Anston">Anston</a> in <a href="/wiki/South_Yorkshire.html" title="South Yorkshire">South Yorkshire</a>. The stone, however, soon began to decay due to <a href="/wiki/Pollution.html" title="Pollution">pollution</a>. Although such defects were clear as early as 1849, nothing was done for the remainder of the 19th century. During the 1910s, however, it became clear that some of the stonework had to be replaced.</p>
<p>In 1928 it was deemed necessary to use Clipsham Stone, a honey-coloured limestone from <a href="/wiki/Rutland.html" title="Rutland">Rutland</a>, to replace the decayed Anston. The project began in the 1930s but was halted due to the Second World War, and completed only during the 1950s. By the 1960s pollution had once again begun to take its toll. A stone conservation and restoration programme began in 1981, and ended in 1994.</p>

The Palace of Westminster's two most famous towers are the Victoria Tower (left) and the Clock Tower (with the clock faces).</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Sir Charles Barry's Palace of Westminster includes several towers. The tallest is the 98 m (323 ft) <a href="/wiki/Victoria_Tower.html" title="Victoria Tower">Victoria Tower</a>, a square tower at the south-western end of the Palace. The tower was named after the reigning monarch at the time of the reconstruction of the Palace, <a href="/wiki/Victoria_of_the_United_Kingdom.html" title="Victoria of the United Kingdom">Queen Victoria</a>. The tower is home to the House of Lords' Record Office, which, despite its name, has custody of the records of both Houses of Parliament. Atop the Victoria Tower is an iron flagstaff, from which the <a href="/wiki/Royal_Standard.html" title="Royal Standard">Royal Standard</a> (if the Sovereign is present in the Palace) or the <a href="/wiki/Union_Flag.html" title="Union Flag">Union Flag</a> is flown. At the base of the Victoria Tower is the Sovereign's Entrance to the Palace. The monarch uses this entrance whenever entering the Palace of Westminster for the <a href="/wiki/State_Opening_of_Parliament.html" title="State Opening of Parliament">State Opening of Parliament</a> or for any other official ceremony.</p>
<p>Over the middle of the Palace lies the Central Tower. The Central Tower is 91 m (300 ft) tall, making it the shortest of the three principal towers of the Palace. Unlike the other towers, the Central Tower possesses a spire. It stands immediately above the Central Lobby, and is octagonally shaped. Its function was originally as a high-level air intake.</p>
<p>A small tower is positioned at the front of the Palace, between Westminster Hall and Old Palace Yard, and contains the main entrance to the House of Commons at its base, known as St. Stephen's entrance.</p>
<p>At the north-western end of the Palace is the most famous of the towers, <b>St Stephen's Tower</b>, the Clock Tower (often referred to as <a href="/wiki/Big_Ben.html" title="Big Ben">Big Ben</a>) which is 96 m (316 ft) tall. The Clock Tower houses a large clock known as the Great Clock of Westminster. On each of the four sides of the tower is a large clock face. The tower also houses five bells, which strike the <a href="/wiki/Westminster_Quarters.html" title="Westminster Quarters">Westminster Chimes</a> every quarter hour. The largest and most famous of the bells is <a href="/wiki/Big_Ben.html" title="Big Ben">Big Ben</a> (officially, the Great Bell of Westminster), which strikes the hour. This is the third heaviest bell in England, weighing 13 tons 10 cwt 99 lb (about 13.8 t). Although the term "Big Ben" properly refers only to the bell, it is often colloquially applied to the whole tower.</p>

<p>The Palace of Westminster includes approximately 1,100 rooms, 100 staircases, and 3 miles (5 km) of passageways. The building includes four floors; the ground floor includes offices, dining rooms, and bars. The 'first floor' (known as the <b>principal floor</b>) houses the main rooms of the Palace, including the Chambers, the lobbies, and the libraries. The Robing Room, the Royal Gallery, the Prince's Chamber, the Lords' Chamber, the Peers' Lobby, the Central Lobby, the Members' Lobby, and the Commons' Chamber all lie in a straight line on this floor, from south to north, in the order noted. (Westminster Hall lies to a side at the Commons end of the Palace.) The top two floors are used for committee rooms and offices.</p>
<p>Formerly, the Palace was controlled by the <a href="/wiki/Lord_Great_Chamberlain.html" title="Lord Great Chamberlain">Lord Great Chamberlain</a>, as it was (and formally remains) a <a href="/wiki/Royal_residence.html" title="Royal residence">royal residence</a>. In 1965, however, it was decided that each House should control its own rooms. The Speaker and Lord Chancellor exercise control on behalf of their respective Houses. The Lord Great Chamberlain retains custody of certain ceremonial rooms.</p>

The old House of Lords chamber in the early 19th century. Benches in the House of Lords are coloured red. The Sovereign's Throne and Canopy are located at one end of the chamber.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The Chamber of the House of Lords is located in the southern part of the Palace of Westminster. The lavishly decorated room measures 14 by 24 m (45 by 80 ft). The benches in the Chamber, as well as other furnishings in the Lords' side of the Palace, are coloured red. The upper part of the Chamber is decorated by stained glass windows and by six allegorical frescoes representing religion, chivalry and law. The upper part, or the viewing gallery, features a small curtain, around ten inches high. This was constructed in the 1920s to hide the ankles and lower legs of viewing women; fashion was becoming increasingly promiscuous, as they saw it, and the sight of bare legs was deemed unsuitable for Lords.</p>
<p>At one end of the Chamber are the ornate gold Canopy and Throne; although the Sovereign may theoretically occupy the Throne during any sitting, he or she attends only the State Opening of Parliament. Other members of the Royal Family who attend the State Opening use Chairs of State next to the Throne. In front of the Throne is the <a href="/wiki/Woolsack.html" title="Woolsack">Woolsack</a>, a backless and armless red cushion stuffed with <a href="/wiki/Wool.html" title="Wool">wool</a>, representing the historical importance of the wool trade. The Woolsack is used by the officer presiding over the House (the <a href="/wiki/Lord_Speaker.html" title="Lord Speaker">Lord Speaker</a> since <a href="/wiki/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>, but historically the <a href="/wiki/Lord_Chancellor.html" title="Lord Chancellor">Lord Chancellor</a> or a deputy). The House's <a href="/wiki/Ceremonial_mace.html" title="Ceremonial mace">mace</a>, which represents royal authority, is placed on the back of the Woolsack. In front of the Woolsack are the Judges' Woolsack (a larger red cushion occupied by the <a href="/wiki/Lords_of_Appeal_in_Ordinary.html" title="Lords of Appeal in Ordinary">Law Lords</a> during the State Opening) and the Table of the House (at which the clerks sit).</p>
<p>Members of the House occupy red benches on three sides of the Chamber. The benches on the Lord Chancellor's right form the Spiritual Side and those to his left form the Temporal Side. The <a href="/wiki/Lords_Spiritual.html" title="Lords Spiritual">Lords Spiritual</a> (archbishops and bishops of the established <a href="/wiki/Church_of_England.html" title="Church of England">Church of England</a>) all occupy the Spiritual Side. The <a href="/wiki/Lords_Temporal.html" title="Lords Temporal">Lords Temporal</a> (nobles) sit according to party affiliation: members of the Government party sit on the Spiritual Side, whilst those of the Opposition sit on the Temporal Side. Some peers, who have no party affiliation, sit on the benches in the middle of the House opposite the Woolsack; they are accordingly known as <a href="/wiki/Cross-bencher.html" title="Cross-bencher">cross-benchers</a>.</p>
<p>The Lords' Chamber is the site of important ceremonies, the most important of which is the State Opening of Parliament, which occurs at the beginning of each annual parliamentary session. The Sovereign, seated on the Throne, delivers the <a href="/wiki/Speech_from_the_Throne.html" title="Speech from the Throne">Speech from the Throne</a>, outlining the Government's legislative agenda for the forthcoming parliamentary session. The Commons do not enter the Chamber; instead, they watch the proceedings from the Bar of the House, just inside the Chamber. A similar ceremony is held at the end of a parliamentary session; the Sovereign, however, does not normally attend, and is instead represented by a group of <a href="/wiki/Lords_Commissioners.html" title="Lords Commissioners">Lords Commissioners</a>.</p>

Benches in the House of Commons Chamber are coloured green.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The Chamber of the House of Commons, which was opened in 1950 after the Victorian chamber had been destroyed in <a href="/wiki/1941.html" title="1941">1941</a> (architect: <a href="/wiki/Giles_Gilbert_Scott.html" title="Giles Gilbert Scott">Giles Gilbert Scott</a>) is at the northern end of the Palace of Westminster. The Chamber measures 14 by 21 m (46 by 68 ft). It is far more austere than the grand Lords' Chamber; the benches, as well as other furnishings in the Commons side of the Palace, are coloured green. It is illegal for a member of the public to sit on the green benches. Other parliaments in <a href="/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Nations.html" title="Commonwealth of Nations">Commonwealth</a> nations have copied the colour scheme under which the Lower House is associated with green, and the Upper House with red.</p>
<p>At one end of the Chamber is the <a href="/wiki/Speaker_of_the_British_House_of_Commons.html" title="Speaker of the British House of Commons">Speaker</a>'s Chair, a present to Parliament from <a href="/wiki/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australia</a>. In front of the Speaker's Chair is the Table of the House, at which the clerks sit, and on which is placed the Commons' ceremonial mace. The dispatch boxes, which front bench MPs often lean on or rest notes on during Questions and speeches, are a gift from <a href="/wiki/New_Zealand.html" title="New Zealand">New Zealand</a>. There are green benches on either side of the house; members of the Government party occupy benches on the Speaker's right, whilst those of the Opposition occupy benches on the Speaker's left. There are no cross-benches as in the House of Lords. The Chamber is relatively small, and can accommodate only 427 of the 646 Members of Parliament. During <a href="/wiki/Prime_Minister%27s_Questions.html" title="Prime Minister's Questions">Prime Minister's Questions</a> and in major debates Members of Parliament stand at either end of the House.</p>
<p>By tradition, the British Sovereign does not enter the Chamber of the House of Commons. The last monarch to enter the Chamber was <a href="/wiki/Charles_I_of_England.html" title="Charles I of England">King Charles I</a> (in 1642); he sought to arrest five Members of Parliament on charges of <a href="/wiki/High_treason.html" title="High treason">high treason</a>. When the King asked the Speaker, <a href="/wiki/William_Lenthall.html" title="William Lenthall">William Lenthall</a>, if he had any knowledge of the whereabouts of these individuals, Lenthall famously replied: "May it please your Majesty, I have neither eyes to see nor tongue to speak in this place but as the House is pleased to direct me, whose servant I am here."</p>
<p>The two red lines on the floor of the House of Commons are, by (probably apocryphal) tradition, two sword lengths and one foot (0.3 m) apart. Protocol dictates that MPs may not cross these lines when speaking. Historically, this was to prevent disputes in the house from devolving into duels.</p>

Westminster Hall in the early 19th century.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Westminster Hall, the oldest existing part of the Palace of Westminster, was erected in 1097. The roof was originally supported by pillars but, during the reign of <a href="/wiki/Richard_II_of_England.html" title="Richard II of England">King Richard II</a>, it was replaced by a <a href="/wiki/Hammerbeam_roof.html" title="Hammerbeam roof">hammerbeam roof</a> designed by <a href="/wiki/Henry_Yevele.html" title="Henry Yevele">Henry Yevele</a> and <a  class="new" title="Hugh Herland">Hugh Herland</a>. Westminster Hall is one of the largest halls in Europe with an unsupported roof; it measures 21 by 73 m (68 by 240 ft). An Essex legend has it that the oak timber came from woods in <a href="/wiki/Thundersley.html" title="Thundersley">Thundersley</a>, Essex.</p>
<p>Westminster Hall has served numerous functions. It was primarily used for judicial purposes, housing three of the most important courts in the land: the <a href="/wiki/King%27s_Bench.html" title="King's Bench">Court of King's Bench</a>, the <a  class="new" title="Court of Common Pleas (England)">Court of Common Pleas</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/Chancery.html" title="Chancery">Court of Chancery</a>. In 1873, these courts were amalgamated into the <a href="/wiki/High_Court_of_Justice_of_England_and_Wales.html" title="High Court of Justice of England and Wales">High Court of Justice</a>, which continued to meet in Westminster Hall until it moved to the <a href="/wiki/Royal_Courts_of_Justice.html" title="Royal Courts of Justice">Royal Courts of Justice</a> in 1882. In addition to regular courts, Westminster Hall also housed important state trials, including <a href="/wiki/Impeachment.html" title="Impeachment">impeachment</a> trials and the trial of King Charles I at the end of the <a href="/wiki/English_Civil_War.html" title="English Civil War">English Civil War</a>.</p>
<p>Westminster Hall has also served ceremonial functions. From the twelfth century to the nineteenth, <a href="/wiki/Coronation_banquet.html" title="Coronation banquet">coronation banquets</a> honouring new monarchs were held here. The last coronation banquet was that of <a href="/wiki/George_IV_of_the_United_Kingdom.html" title="George IV of the United Kingdom">King George IV</a> (1821); his successor, <a href="/wiki/William_IV_of_the_United_Kingdom.html" title="William IV of the United Kingdom">William IV</a>, abandoned the idea because he deemed it too expensive. Westminster Hall has also been used for <a href="/wiki/Lying-in-state.html" title="Lying-in-state">lyings-in-state</a> during <a href="/wiki/State_funeral.html" title="State funeral">state funerals</a> and ceremonial funerals. Such an honour is usually reserved for the Sovereign and for their consorts; the only non-royals to receive it in the twentieth century were <a href="/wiki/Frederick_Sleigh_Roberts%2C_1st_Earl_Roberts.html" title="Frederick Sleigh Roberts, 1st Earl Roberts">Frederick Sleigh Roberts, 1st Earl Roberts</a> (1914) and <a href="/wiki/Winston_Churchill.html" title="Winston Churchill">Sir Winston Churchill</a> (1965). The most recent lying-in-state was that of <a href="/wiki/Elizabeth_Bowes-Lyon.html" title="Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon">Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother</a> in 2002.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>In 1999 and 2003, the staff of the Palace were given special permission to return the Hall to its original purpose, by the holding of two Grand Parties there.</p>
<p>The two Houses have presented ceremonial Addresses to the Crown in Westminster Hall on important public occasions. For example, Addresses have been presented at <a href="/wiki/Elizabeth_II_of_the_United_Kingdom.html" title="Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom">Elizabeth II</a>'s Silver Jubilee (1977) and Golden Jubilee (2002), the 300th anniversary of the <a href="/wiki/Glorious_Revolution.html" title="Glorious Revolution">Glorious Revolution</a> (1988), and the fiftieth anniversary of the end of the Second World War (1995).</p>
<p>Under reforms made in 1999, the House of Commons uses a specially converted room next to Westminster Hall (not the main hall) as an additional debating chamber. (Usually, however, the room is spoken of as a part of Westminster Hall.) The room is shaped like an elongated horseshoe; it stands in contrast with the main Chamber, in which the benches are placed opposite each other. This pattern is meant to reflect the non-partisan nature of the debates held in Westminster Hall. Westminster Hall sittings occur thrice each week; important or controversial matters are not usually discussed.</p>

<h3>Other rooms</h3>
<p>There are several other important rooms that lie on the first floor of the Palace. At the extreme southern end of the Palace is the Robing Room, the room in which the Sovereign prepares for the State Opening of Parliament by donning official robes and wearing the <a href="/wiki/Imperial_State_Crown.html" title="Imperial State Crown">Imperial State Crown</a>. Paintings by <a href="/wiki/William_Dyce.html" title="William Dyce">William Dyce</a> in the Robing Room depict scenes from the legend of <a href="/wiki/King_Arthur.html" title="King Arthur">King Arthur</a>. Immediately next to the Robing Room is the Royal Gallery, which is sometimes used by foreign dignitaries who wish to address both Houses. The walls are decorated by two enormous paintings by <a href="/wiki/Daniel_Maclise.html" title="Daniel Maclise">Daniel Maclise</a>: "The Death of Nelson" (depicting <a href="/wiki/Horatio_Nelson%2C_1st_Viscount_Nelson.html" title="Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson">Lord Nelson</a>'s demise at the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Trafalgar.html" title="Battle of Trafalgar">Battle of Trafalgar</a>) and "The Meeting of Wellington and Blücher" (showing the <a href="/wiki/Arthur_Wellesley%2C_1st_Duke_of_Wellington.html" title="Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington">Duke of Wellington</a> meeting <a href="/wiki/Gebhard_Leberecht_von_Bl%C3%BCcher.html" title="Gebhard Leberecht von Blücher">Gebhard Leberecht von Blücher</a> at the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Waterloo.html" title="Battle of Waterloo">Battle of Waterloo</a>).</p>
<p>To the immediate south of the Lords Chamber is the Prince's Chamber, a small <a  class="new" title="Ante-room">ante-room</a> used by Members of the Lords. The Prince's Chamber is decorated with paintings of members of the <a href="/wiki/Tudor_dynasty.html" title="Tudor dynasty">Tudor dynasty</a>. To the immediate north of the Lord's Chamber is the Peers' Lobby, where Lords informally discuss or negotiate matters during sittings of the House.</p>
<p>The centrepiece of the Palace of Westminster is the octagonal Central Lobby, which lies immediately beyond the Peers' Lobby. The lobby, which lies immediately below the Central Tower, is adorned with statues of statesmen and with <a href="/wiki/Mosaic.html" title="Mosaic">mosaics</a> representing the United Kingdom's constituent nations' patron saints: <a href="/wiki/St_George.html" title="St George">St George</a> for England, <a href="/wiki/St_Andrew.html" title="St Andrew">St Andrew</a> for Scotland, <a href="/wiki/St_David.html" title="St David">St David</a> for Wales, and <a href="/wiki/St_Patrick.html" title="St Patrick">St Patrick</a> for Ireland (these predate the secession of the Republic). Constituents may meet their Members of Parliament in the Central Lobby. Beyond the Central Lobby, next to the Commons Chamber, lies the Members' Lobby, in which Members of Parliament hold discussions or negotiations. The Members' Lobby contains statues of several former Prime Ministers, including <a href="/wiki/David_Lloyd_George.html" title="David Lloyd George">David Lloyd George</a>, <a href="/wiki/Winston_Churchill.html" title="Winston Churchill">Sir Winston Churchill</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Clement_Attlee.html" title="Clement Attlee">Clement Attlee</a>.</p>
<p>There are two suites of libraries on the Principal Floor, overlooking the river, for the House of Lords and <a href="/wiki/House_of_Commons_Library.html" title="House of Commons Library">House of Commons Library</a>.</p>
<p>The Palace of Westminster also includes state apartments for the presiding officers of the two Houses. The <a href="/wiki/Official_residence.html" title="Official residence">official residence</a> of the Speaker stands at the northern end of the Palace, whilst the Lord Chancellor's apartments are at the southern end. Each day, the Speaker and Lord Chancellor take part in formal processions from their apartments to their respective Chambers.</p>

<p>Probably the most famous attempt to breach the security of the Palace of Westminster was the <a href="/wiki/Gunpowder_Plot.html" title="Gunpowder Plot">Gunpowder Plot</a> of 1605. The plot was an attempt by <a href="/wiki/Roman_Catholic.html" title="Roman Catholic">Roman Catholic</a> extremists to cause an explosion in the Palace of Westminster during the State Opening of Parliament, thereby killing the Protestant <a href="/wiki/James_I_of_England.html" title="James I of England">King James I</a>, his family, and most of the aristocracy. The plot was discovered, however, when a Roman Catholic nobleman, <a href="/wiki/William_Parker%2C_4th_Baron_Monteagle.html" title="William Parker, 4th Baron Monteagle">William Parker, 4th Baron Monteagle</a>, received an anonymous letter warning him not to attend the State Opening. The authorities conducted a search of the Palace, discovered the gunpowder, as well as one of the conspirators, <a href="/wiki/Guy_Fawkes.html" title="Guy Fawkes">Guy Fawkes</a>. The conspirators were later tried for high treason in Westminster Hall, and were <a href="/wiki/Hanging%2C_drawing_and_quartering.html" title="Hanging, drawing and quartering">hanged, drawn and quartered</a>. Since 1605, the <a href="/wiki/Yeomen_of_the_Guard.html" title="Yeomen of the Guard">Yeomen of the Guard</a> have conducted a ceremonial search of the Palace's cellars prior to each State Opening of Parliament.</p>
<p>The previous Palace of Westminster was also the site of a prime ministerial assassination in 1812. Whilst in the lobby of the House of Commons, on his way to a parliamentary inquiry, <a href="/wiki/Spencer_Perceval.html" title="Spencer Perceval">Spencer Perceval</a> was shot and killed by <a href="/wiki/John_Bellingham.html" title="John Bellingham">John Bellingham</a>. Perceval remains the only British Prime Minister to have been assassinated.</p>
<p>On the <a href="/wiki/June_17.html" title="June 17">17 June</a> <a href="/wiki/1974.html" title="1974">1974</a> a 20 pound (9 kg) bomb planted by the <a href="/wiki/Provisional_Irish_Republican_Army.html" title="Provisional Irish Republican Army">Provisional IRA</a> exploded in Westminster Hall.

Both the <a href="/wiki/Irish_National_Liberation_Army.html" title="Irish National Liberation Army">Irish National Liberation Army</a> and the Provisional IRA claimed responsibility for the murder; security forces believe the former were responsible. With rising concern about the possibility of a truck full of explosives being driven into the building (despite the effective cessation by that time of Northern Irish terrorism), a series of concrete blocks was placed in the roadway in 2003.</p>

Concern about such attacks and a possible chemical or biological attack led to the construction of a glass screen across the Strangers' Gallery in early 2004.</p>
<p>The new barrier did not cover the front three rows, which are termed the "Distinguished Strangers' Gallery" and in May of that year protesters from <a href="/wiki/Fathers_4_Justice.html" title="Fathers 4 Justice">Fathers 4 Justice</a> attacked Prime Minister Tony Blair with <a href="/wiki/Fathers_4_Justice_House_of_Commons_protest#House_of_Commons_protest.html" title="Fathers 4 Justice House of Commons protest">flour bombs</a> from this part. In September, five protesters opposed to the proposed ban on <a href="/wiki/Fox_hunting.html" title="Fox hunting">fox hunting</a> disrupted the proceedings of the House of Commons by running into the Chamber.</p>
<p>Despite the recent security breaches, members of the public continue to have access to the Gallery. Visitors are heavily vetted.</p>
<p>Large numbers of heavily armed police guard the building and security checks take place before people are allowed to enter the building. When ministers are present their personal security also attend.</p>

<h2>Culture and tourism</h2>
<p>The exterior of the Palace of Westminster—especially the Clock Tower—is one of the most visited tourist attractions in London. The <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_Educational%2C_Scientific_and_Cultural_Organization.html" title="United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization">United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization</a> (UNESCO) classifies the Palace of Westminster as a <a href="/wiki/World_Heritage_Site.html" title="World Heritage Site">World Heritage Site</a>. It is also a <a href="/wiki/Listed_building.html" title="Listed building">Grade I listed building</a>. There is no casual access to the interior, but it may be seen in a number of ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Viewing debates from the <i>public galleries</i> of the House of Commons or the House of Lords: UK residents may obtain tickets in advance from their MP. It is also possible for both UK residents and overseas visitors to queue for admission on the day, but capacity is limited and there is no guarantee of admission. Only a very small part of the Palace's interior may be seen. Either House may exclude "strangers" if it desires to sit in private.</li>
<li><i>Tours during Parliamentary sessions</i>: UK residents may apply to their MP or a peer for a place on a guided tour of Parliament while it is in session. British educational institutions may also arrange a tour through their MP. The system for issuing overseas visitors with permits to tour the Palace while Parliament is in session has been suspended temporarily.</li>
<li><i>Summer opening</i>: tours are available during a two-month period during the summer when Parliament is not sitting. These tours are open to both UK residents and overseas visitors. Advance bookings are recommended. <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.parliament.uk/visiting/summer_opening.cfm">[1]</a></li>
<li><i>Television Viewing</i>: live broadcasts of Parliamentary sessions can be viewed on <a href="/wiki/BBC_Parliament.html" title="BBC Parliament">BBC Parliament</a>, recorded footage is shown whilst Parliament is not in session.</li>
</ul>
<p>Since <a href="/wiki/August_1.html" title="August 1">1 August</a> <a href="/wiki/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>, under a provision of the <a href="/wiki/Serious_Organised_Crime_and_Police_Act_2005.html" title="Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005">Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005</a> it has been illegal to hold a protest, without the prior permission of the Metropolitan Police, within a designated area extending half a mile around the Palace.</p>
