<p><b>Buckingham Palace</b> is the official <a href="/wiki/London.html" title="London">London</a> residence of the <a href="/wiki/British_monarch.html" title="British monarch">British monarch</a>. The Palace is a setting for state occasions and royal entertaining, a base for all officially visiting <a href="/wiki/Head_of_State.html" title="Head of State">Heads of State</a>, and a major tourist attraction. It has been a rallying point for British people at times of national rejoicing, crisis or grief. "Buckingham Palace" or simply "The Palace" commonly refers to the source of Press statements issued by the offices of the <a href="/wiki/Royal_Household.html" title="Royal Household">Royal Household</a>.</p>
<p>In the Middle Ages, Buckingham Palace's site formed part of the Manor of Ebury. It had several Royal owners from <a href="/wiki/Edward_the_Confessor.html" title="Edward the Confessor">Edward the Confessor</a> onwards and was also the object of much property speculation. (A loophole in the lease of <a href="/wiki/Charles_I_of_England.html" title="Charles I of England">Charles I</a> allowed the area to revert back to royal hands in the 18th century.) Precursors of Buckingham Palace were Blake House, Goring House, and Arlington House.</p>
<p>Originally known as Buckingham House, the building forming the core of today's palace was formerly a large <a href="/wiki/Townhouse.html" title="Townhouse">townhouse</a> built for the <a href="/wiki/John_Sheffield%2C_1st_Duke_of_Buckingham_and_Normanby.html" title="John Sheffield, 1st Duke of Buckingham and Normanby">Duke of Buckingham</a> in 1703 and acquired by <a href="/wiki/George_III_of_the_United_Kingdom.html" title="George III of the United Kingdom">King George III</a> in 1762 as a private <a href="/wiki/Residence.html" title="Residence">residence</a>. It was enlarged over the next 75 years, principally by <a href="/wiki/Architect.html" title="Architect">architects</a> <a href="/wiki/John_Nash_%28architect%29.html" title="John Nash (architect)">John Nash</a> and <a href="/wiki/Edward_Blore.html" title="Edward Blore">Edward Blore</a>, forming three wings around a central courtyard. Buckingham Palace finally became the official royal palace of the British monarch on the accession of <a href="/wiki/Victoria_of_the_United_Kingdom.html" title="Victoria of the United Kingdom">Queen Victoria</a> in 1837. The last major structural additions were made in the late 19th and early 20th Century, when the large East wing facing <a href="/wiki/The_Mall_%28London%29.html" title="The Mall (London)">The Mall</a> was added, and the former State entrance, <a href="/wiki/Marble_Arch.html" title="Marble Arch">Marble Arch</a>, was removed to its present position near <a href="/wiki/Speakers%27_Corner.html" title="Speakers' Corner">Speakers' Corner</a> in <a href="/wiki/Hyde_Park%2C_London.html" title="Hyde Park, London">Hyde Park</a>. The East Front was refaced in <a href="/wiki/Portland_stone.html" title="Portland stone">Portland stone</a> in 1913 as a backdrop to the <a href="/wiki/Victoria_Memorial_%28London%29.html" title="Victoria Memorial (London)">Victoria Memorial</a>, creating the present-day 'public face' of Buckingham Palace, including the famous balcony.</p>
<p>The original early 19th century interior designs, many of which still survive, included widespread use of brightly coloured <a href="/wiki/Scagliola.html" title="Scagliola">scagliola</a> and blue and pink <a href="/wiki/Lapis_lazuli.html" title="Lapis lazuli">lapis</a>, on the advice of Sir <a href="/wiki/Charles_Long.html" title="Charles Long">Charles Long</a>. <a href="/wiki/Edward_VII_of_the_United_Kingdom.html" title="Edward VII of the United Kingdom">King Edward VII</a> oversaw a partial redecoration in a <a href="/wiki/Belle_epoque.html" title="Belle epoque">Belle epoque</a> cream and gold colour scheme. Many smaller reception rooms are furnished in the <a href="/wiki/China.html" title="China">Chinese</a> <a href="/wiki/Chinoiserie.html" title="Chinoiserie">regency</a> style with furniture and fittings brought from the <a href="/wiki/Royal_Pavilion.html" title="Royal Pavilion">Royal Pavilion</a> at <a href="/wiki/Brighton.html" title="Brighton">Brighton</a> and from <a href="/wiki/Carlton_House.html" title="Carlton House">Carlton House</a> following the death of <a href="/wiki/George_IV_of_the_United_Kingdom.html" title="George IV of the United Kingdom">King George IV</a>. The <a href="/wiki/Buckingham_Palace_Gardens.html" title="Buckingham Palace Gardens">Buckingham Palace Gardens</a> are the largest private gardens in London, originally landscaped by <a href="/wiki/Capability_Brown.html" title="Capability Brown">Capability Brown</a>, but redesigned by <a  class="new" title="William Townsend Ailton">William Townsend Ailton</a> of <a href="/wiki/Royal_Botanic_Gardens%2C_Kew.html" title="Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew">Kew Gardens</a> and John Nash. The artificially-created lake was completed in 1828 and is supplied with water from the <a href="/wiki/Serpentine_%28lake%29.html" title="Serpentine (lake)">Serpentine</a>, a lake in <a href="/wiki/Hyde_Park%2C_London.html" title="Hyde Park, London">Hyde Park</a>.</p>
<p>The State Rooms form the nucleus of the working Palace and are used regularly by The Queen and members of the Royal family for official and State entertaining. Buckingham Palace is one of the world's most familiar buildings and more than 50,000 people visit the Palace each year as guests to banquets, lunches, dinners, receptions and the Royal Garden Parties.</p>

<h3>The site</h3>
<p>In the Middle Ages, Buckingham Palace's site formed part of the Manor of Ebury (also called Eia). The marshy ground was watered by the river <a href="/wiki/Tyburn_%28stream%29.html" title="Tyburn (stream)">Tyburn</a>, which still flows below the courtyard and south wing of the palace. Where the river was fordable - Cow Ford - a village, Eye Cross, grew up. Ownership of the site changed hands many times, including <a href="/wiki/Edward_the_Confessor.html" title="Edward the Confessor">Edward the Confessor</a> and his wife <a href="/wiki/Edith_of_Wessex.html" title="Edith of Wessex">Queen Edith</a>, and, after the Norman Conquest, <a href="/wiki/William_the_Conqueror.html" title="William the Conqueror">William the Conqueror</a>, who gave it to <a href="/wiki/Geoffrey_de_Mandeville.html" title="Geoffrey de Mandeville">Geoffrey de Mandeville</a>. Mandeville bequeathed it to the monks of <a href="/wiki/Westminster_Abbey.html" title="Westminster Abbey">Westminster Abbey</a>. <sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a  title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 1531 <a href="/wiki/King_Henry_VIII.html" title="King Henry VIII">King Henry VIII</a> acquired from <a href="/wiki/Eton_College.html" title="Eton College">Eton College</a> the Hospital of St James (later <a href="/wiki/St_James%27s_Palace.html" title="St James's Palace">St James's Palace</a>), and in 1536 he received the Manor of Ebury from Westminster Abbey. These transfers brought the site of Buckingham Palace back into royal hands for the first time since William the Conqueror had given it away almost 500 years earlier.</p>
<p>Various owners leased it from Royal landlords and the <a href="/wiki/Freehold_%28real_property%29.html" title="Freehold (real property)">freehold</a> was the subject of frenzied speculation in the 17th century. By then, the old village of Eye Cross had long ago fallen into decay and the area was mostly wasteland.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a  title="">[2]</a></sup> Needing money, <a href="/wiki/James_I_of_England.html" title="James I of England">King James I</a> sold part of the Crown freehold off but retained part of the site on which he established a 4-acre Mulberry Garden for the production of silk. (This is at the northwest corner of today's palace.) Clement Walker in <i>Anarchia Anglicana</i> (1649) refers to "new-erected sodoms and spintries at the Mulberry Garden at S. James's", suggesting it may have been a place of debauchery.</p>
<p>Eventually, in the late 17th century, the freehold was inherited from the property tycoon Sir Hugh Audley by the great heiress Mary Davies.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a  title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: The first houses on the site">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="The_first_houses_on_the_site" id="The_first_houses_on_the_site"></a></p>
<h3>The first houses on the site</h3>
<p>Possibly the first house erected within the site was that of a Sir William Blake, around 1624.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a  title="">[4]</a></sup> The next owner was <a href="/wiki/George_Goring%2C_1st_Earl_of_Norwich.html" title="George Goring, 1st Earl of Norwich">Lord Goring</a>, who from 1633 extended Blake's house and developed much of today's garden, then known as Goring Great Garden. He did not, however, manage to obtain freehold interest in the Mulberry Garden. Unbeknown to Goring, in 1640 the document "failed to pass the great seal before <a href="/wiki/King_Charles_I_of_England.html" title="King Charles I of England">King Charles I</a> fled London, which it needed to do for legal execution."<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a  title="">[5]</a></sup> (It was this critical omission that helped the British Royal Family regain the freehold under <a href="/wiki/George_III_of_Great_Britain.html" title="George III of Great Britain">King George III</a>.)</p>
<p>The improvident Goring defaulted on his rents; <a href="/wiki/Henry_Bennet%2C_1st_Earl_of_Arlington.html" title="Henry Bennet, 1st Earl of Arlington">Henry Bennet, 1st Earl of Arlington</a> obtained and was occupying the mansion, now known as Goring House, when it burnt down in 1674. Arlington House rose on the site - the southern wing of today's Palace - the following year, and its freehold was sold on in 1702.</p>
<p>The house which forms the architectural core of the present palace was built for the first <a href="/wiki/John_Sheffield%2C_1st_Duke_of_Buckingham_and_Normanby.html" title="John Sheffield, 1st Duke of Buckingham and Normanby">Duke of Buckingham and Normanby</a> in 1703 to the design of <a href="/wiki/William_Winde.html" title="William Winde">William Winde</a>. The style chosen was of a large, three-floored central block with two smaller flanking service wings.</p>
<p>Buckingham House, as it was known, was eventually sold by Buckingham's descendant, Sir Charles Sheffield, in 1762 to King <a href="/wiki/George_III.html" title="George III">George III</a> for <a href="/wiki/%C2%A3.html" title="£">£</a>21,000.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a  title="">[6]</a></sup> (Like his grandfather, George II, George III refused to sell the Mulberry Garden interest, so that Sheffield had been unable to purchase the full freehold of the site.) The house was originally intended as a private retreat for the Royal Family, and in particular for <a href="/wiki/Charlotte_of_Mecklenburg-Strelitz.html" title="Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz">Queen Charlotte</a>, and was known as "The Queen's House." <a href="/wiki/St._James%27s_Palace.html" title="St. James's Palace">St. James's Palace</a> remained the official and ceremonial royal residence; indeed, the tradition continues to date of foreign <a href="/wiki/Ambassador.html" title="Ambassador">ambassadors</a> being formally accredited to "the <a href="/wiki/Court_of_St._James%27s.html" title="Court of St. James's">Court of St. James's</a>", even though it is at Buckingham Palace that they present their credentials and staff to the Queen upon their appointment.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>Queen Charlotte died in 1818 and <a href="/wiki/George_III_of_the_United_Kingdom.html" title="George III of the United Kingdom">George III</a> in 1820. The <a href="/wiki/Spendthrift.html" title="Spendthrift">spendthrift</a> <a href="/wiki/George_IV_of_the_United_Kingdom.html" title="George IV of the United Kingdom">King George IV</a> decided to enlarge Buckingham House to use in conjunction with St. James's Palace as had his father, but by 1826 he had decided to convert the house to a fully equipped royal palace. He commissioned <a href="/wiki/John_Nash_%28architect%29.html" title="John Nash (architect)">John Nash</a> to realise his vision. The palace which arose formed three sides of an open <a href="/wiki/Cour_d%27honneur.html" title="Cour d'honneur">cour d'honneur</a>, with the former Buckingham House as the <a href="/wiki/Corps_de_logis.html" title="Corps de logis">corps de logis</a>. The new work was faced in <a href="/wiki/Bath.html" title="Bath">Bath</a> stone, with exquisite detailing in the <a href="/wiki/France.html" title="France">French</a> <a href="/wiki/Neoclassicism.html" title="Neoclassicism">neoclassical</a> style. This is the palace much as it is today, but without the great East Front (facing <a href="/wiki/The_Mall_%28London%29.html" title="The Mall (London)">The Mall</a>) which now encloses the quadrangle. On the future site of the present East Front, between the two projecting wings, was a colossal triumphal arch of <a  class="new" title="Racaccione">Racaccione</a> <a href="/wiki/Marble.html" title="Marble">marble</a>, modelled on the <a href="/wiki/Arch_of_Constantine.html" title="Arch of Constantine">Arch of Constantine</a> in <a href="/wiki/Rome.html" title="Rome">Rome</a>. This arch, which had cost <a href="/wiki/Pound_sterling.html" title="Pound sterling">£</a>34,450 to erect, served as the State entrance. George IV had intended it to be crowned by a <a href="/wiki/Bronze.html" title="Bronze">bronze</a> equestrian statue of himself, but he died before its completion, and when <a href="/wiki/Parliament.html" title="Parliament">Parliament</a> reluctantly paid the bill for it, they decided to erect it in <a href="/wiki/Hyde_Park.html" title="Hyde Park">Hyde Park</a>, where it remains today. The interiors of the palace were to be of unparalleled splendour. George IV was advised on the interior design by Sir <a href="/wiki/Charles_Long.html" title="Charles Long">Charles Long</a>, who advocated the widespread use of brightly coloured <a href="/wiki/Scagliola.html" title="Scagliola">scagliola</a> and blue and pink <a href="/wiki/Lapis_lazuli.html" title="Lapis lazuli">lapis</a>, with sculptured plaster panels set in the ceilings. George IV died in 1830, and the colourful and heavily gilded present <a href="/wiki/State_room.html" title="State room">state and semi-state rooms</a> were not completed until the reign of <a href="/wiki/William_IV_of_the_United_Kingdom.html" title="William IV of the United Kingdom">King William IV</a>.</p>

<p>By the time of George IV's death, the escalating cost of the still unfinished palace was causing concern in both Parliament and the Press. William IV dismissed Nash as architect and employed <a href="/wiki/Edward_Blore.html" title="Edward Blore">Edward Blore</a>, who suited admirably the more restrained tastes of the new king. A less idealistic but more businesslike architect than Nash, Blore retained Nash's contributions and completed the palace in a similar, if more solid and less picturesque, vein. The final cost to the nation of rebuilding Buckingham Palace was in excess of £719,000.</p>
<p>Though William IV and <a href="/wiki/Adelaide_of_Saxe-Meiningen.html" title="Adelaide of Saxe-Meiningen">Queen Adelaide</a> held receptions and courts in the State rooms, they never lived in the palace, preferring to remain at <a href="/wiki/Clarence_House.html" title="Clarence House">Clarence House</a>, the more modest London <a href="/wiki/Mansion.html" title="Mansion">mansion</a> they had commissioned to be built before their succession. Moreover, when the <a href="/wiki/Palace_of_Westminster.html" title="Palace of Westminster">Houses of Parliament</a> burned down in 1834, the King offered the incomplete palace to the nation as a replacement seat of government. (The offer was declined and the old <a href="/wiki/Palace_of_Westminster.html" title="Palace of Westminster">Palace of Westminster</a> rebuilt.)</p>
<p>Many of the smaller reception rooms were furnished during William IV's reign - as they remain today - in the Chinese Regency style, utilising many of the fireplaces, decorations, and furniture brought from George IV's palaces, the <a href="/wiki/Royal_Pavilion.html" title="Royal Pavilion">Royal Pavilion</a> at <a href="/wiki/Brighton.html" title="Brighton">Brighton</a> and from <a href="/wiki/Carlton_House.html" title="Carlton House">Carlton House</a>, following his death.</p>

A garden party at Buckingham Palace in 1868.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>At the rear of the palace is the large park-like <a href="/wiki/Buckingham_Palace_Gardens.html" title="Buckingham Palace Gardens">garden</a>, the largest private garden in London. The landscape design was by <a href="/wiki/Capability_Brown.html" title="Capability Brown">Capability Brown</a> but the garden was redesigned at the time of the palace rebuilding by <a href="/wiki/William_Aiton.html" title="William Aiton">William Aiton</a> of <a href="/wiki/Kew_Gardens.html" title="Kew Gardens">Kew Gardens</a> and John Nash.

<p>Like the palace itself, the <a href="/wiki/Buckingham_Palace_Gardens.html" title="Buckingham Palace Gardens">Buckingham Palace Gardens</a> are rich in works of art. One of the most notable is the <a href="/wiki/Waterloo_Vase.html" title="Waterloo Vase">Waterloo Vase</a>, the great urn commissioned by <a href="/wiki/Napoleon.html" title="Napoleon">Napoleon</a> to commemorate his anticipated victories, which in 1815 was presented unfinished to <a href="/wiki/George_IV_of_the_United_Kingdom.html" title="George IV of the United Kingdom">the Prince Regent</a> by <a href="/wiki/Ferdinand_III%2C_Grand_Duke_of_Tuscany.html" title="Ferdinand III, Grand Duke of Tuscany">Ferdinand, Grand Duke of Tuscany</a>. The king had the vase completed by the sculptor <a href="/wiki/Richard_Westmacott.html" title="Richard Westmacott">Richard Westmacott</a>, intending it to be the focal point of the new Waterloo chamber at Windsor Castle. But at 15 ft high and weighing 15 tons, no floor could bear the weight, and it was presented to the <a href="/wiki/National_Gallery%2C_London.html" title="National Gallery, London">National Gallery</a>. The Gallery finally returned the <a href="/wiki/White_elephant.html" title="White elephant">white elephant</a> to the Sovereign in 1906. <a href="/wiki/Edward_VII_of_the_United_Kingdom.html" title="Edward VII of the United Kingdom">Edward VII</a> then solved the problem by placing the vase outside in the garden where it now remains. Also in the gardens is a small summerhouse attributed to <a href="/wiki/William_Kent.html" title="William Kent">William Kent</a>, circa 1740.</p>
<p>In June 2002 the Queen invited the public into her Garden for entertainment for the first time during her reign. As part of her <a href="/wiki/Golden_Jubilee_Weekend.html" title="Golden Jubilee Weekend">Golden Jubilee Weekend</a> thousands of Britons were invited to apply for tickets to <a href="/wiki/Party_at_the_Palace.html" title="Party at the Palace">Party at the Palace</a> where the guitarist <a href="/wiki/Brian_May.html" title="Brian May">Brian May</a> of the band <a href="/wiki/Queen_%28band%29.html" title="Queen (band)">Queen</a> performed his "<a href="/wiki/God_Save_The_Queen.html" title="God Save The Queen">God Save The Queen</a>" guitar solo on top of Buckingham Palace. This concert was preceded the previous evening by a <a href="/wiki/Prom_at_the_Palace.html" title="Prom at the Palace">Prom at the Palace</a>. During the Queen's 80th birthday celebrations in 2006 the Garden was the scene of <a href="/wiki/Children%27s_Party_at_the_Palace.html" title="Children's Party at the Palace">Children's Party at the Palace</a> for an audience of 2000 children.</p>
<p>The garden is the setting for the many garden Parties held by the Queen each summer. However, guests, while numerous and from all stations in life, are usually those who hold a public position, or are in some way of national interest.</p>
<p>Adjacent to the palace is the <a href="/wiki/Royal_Mews.html" title="Royal Mews">Royal Mews</a>, also designed by Nash, where the royal carriages, including the <a href="/wiki/Gold_State_Coach.html" title="Gold State Coach">Gold State Coach</a>, are housed.

<p>Buckingham Palace finally became the principal Royal residence in 1837 on the accession of <a href="/wiki/Victoria_of_the_United_Kingdom.html" title="Victoria of the United Kingdom">Queen Victoria</a>. While the State Rooms were a riot of gilt and colour, the necessities of the new palace were somewhat less luxurious. It was reported the chimneys smoked so much that the fires had to be allowed to die, and consequently the court shivered in icy magnificence. Ventilation was so bad that the interior smelled, and when a decision was taken to install gas lamps there was a serious worry about the build up of gas on the lower floors. It was also said that the staff were lax and lazy and the palace was dirty. Following the Queen's marriage in 1840, her husband, <a href="/wiki/Prince_Albert_of_Saxe-Coburg-Gotha.html" title="Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha">Prince Albert</a>, concerned himself with a reorganization of the household offices and staff, and with the design faults of the palace. The problems were rectified, the builders finally leaving the palace in 1840.</p>
<p>By 1847, the couple had found the palace too small for Court life and their growing family, and consequently the new wing, designed by <a href="/wiki/Edward_Blore.html" title="Edward Blore">Edward Blore</a>, was built, enclosing the central quadrangle. This large east wing, facing <a href="/wiki/The_Mall_%28London%29.html" title="The Mall (London)">The Mall</a> is today the 'public face' of Buckingham Palace and contains the balcony from which the <a href="/wiki/Royal_Family.html" title="Royal Family">Royal Family</a> acknowledge the crowds on momentous occasions and annually following <a href="/wiki/Trooping_the_Colour.html" title="Trooping the Colour">Trooping the Colour</a>. The <a href="/wiki/Ballroom.html" title="Ballroom">ballroom</a> wing and a further suite of state rooms were also built in this period, designed by Nash's student Sir <a href="/wiki/James_Pennethorne.html" title="James Pennethorne">James Pennethorne</a>.</p>
<p>Before Prince Albert's demise, Queen Victoria was known to love music and dancing, and the greatest contemporary musicians entertained at Buckingham Palace. <a href="/wiki/Felix_Mendelssohn.html" title="Felix Mendelssohn">Felix Mendelssohn</a> is known to have played there on three occasions. <a href="/wiki/Johann_Strauss_II.html" title="Johann Strauss II">Johann Strauss II</a> and his <a href="/wiki/Orchestra.html" title="Orchestra">orchestra</a> played there when in England. Strauss' 'Alice Polka' was first performed at the palace in 1849 in honour of the Queen's daughter, <a href="/wiki/Princess_Alice_of_the_United_Kingdom.html" title="Princess Alice of the United Kingdom">Princess Alice</a>. Under Victoria, Buckingham Palace was frequently the scene of lavish costume balls, in addition to the routine royal ceremonies, investitures and presentations.</p>
<p>Queen Victoria had <a href="/wiki/Marble_Arch.html" title="Marble Arch">Marble Arch</a>, the former State entrance to the palace, moved to its present position near <a href="/wiki/Speakers%27_Corner.html" title="Speakers' Corner">Speakers' Corner</a> in <a href="/wiki/Hyde_Park%2C_London.html" title="Hyde Park, London">Hyde Park</a>. When widowed in 1861, the griefstricken Queen withdrew from public life and left Buckingham Palace to live at <a href="/wiki/Windsor_Castle.html" title="Windsor Castle">Windsor Castle</a>, <a href="/wiki/Balmoral_Castle.html" title="Balmoral Castle">Balmoral Castle</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Osborne_House.html" title="Osborne House">Osborne House</a>. For many years the palace was seldom used, and even neglected. Eventually public opinion forced her to return to London, though even then she preferred to live elsewhere whenever possible. Court functions were still held at Windsor Castle rather than at the palace, presided over by the sombre Queen habitually dressed in mourning black.</p>

</div>
<p>The principal rooms of the Palace are contained on the <i><a href="/wiki/Piano_nobile.html" title="Piano nobile">piano nobile</a></i> behind the west-facing garden facade at the rear of the Palace. The centre of this ornate suite of State Rooms is the Music Room, its large bow the dominant feature of the facade. Flanking the Music Room are the Blue and the White <a href="/wiki/Drawing_room.html" title="Drawing room">Drawing rooms</a>. At the centre of the suite, serving as a corridor to link the state rooms, is the Picture Gallery, which is top lit and 55 yards (50 m) long. The Gallery is hung with works by <a href="/wiki/Rembrandt_Harmenszoon_van_Rijn.html" title="Rembrandt Harmenszoon van Rijn">Rembrandt</a>, <a href="/wiki/Anthony_van_Dyck.html" title="Anthony van Dyck">van Dyck</a>, <a href="/wiki/Peter_Paul_Rubens.html" title="Peter Paul Rubens">Rubens</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Johannes_Vermeer.html" title="Johannes Vermeer">Vermeer</a>, among many others. Other rooms leading from the Picture Gallery are the <a href="/wiki/Throne_Room.html" title="Throne Room">Throne Room</a> and the Green Drawing Room. The Green Drawing room serves as a huge anteroom to the Throne Room, and is part of the ceremonial route to the Throne from the Guard Room at the top of the Grand Staircase. The Guard Room contains a white marble statue of Prince Albert, in Roman costume set in a <a href="/wiki/Tribune_%28architecture%29.html" title="Tribune (architecture)">tribune</a> lined with tapestries. These very formal rooms are used only for ceremonial and official entertaining.</p>
<p>Directly underneath the State Apartments is a suite of slightly less grand rooms known as the semi-state apartments. Opening from the marble hall, these rooms are used for less-formal entertaining, such as luncheon parties and private audiences. Some of the rooms are named and decorated for particular visitors, such as the '1844 Room', which was decorated in that year for the State visit of <a href="/wiki/Tsar.html" title="Tsar">Emperor</a> <a href="/wiki/Nicholas_I_of_Russia.html" title="Nicholas I of Russia">Nicholas I</a> of <a href="/wiki/Russia.html" title="Russia">Russia</a>. At the centre of this suite is the Bow Room, through which thousands of guests pass annually to the Queen's Garden Parties in the Gardens beyond. The Queen uses privately a smaller suite of rooms in the North wing.</p>
<p>Between 1847 and 1850, when Blore was building the new east wing, the Brighton Pavilion was once again plundered of its fittings. As a result many of the rooms in the new wing have a distinctly oriental atmosphere. The red and blue Chinese Luncheon Room is made up from parts of the Brighton banqueting and music rooms, but has a chimney piece, also from Brighton, in design more Indian than Chinese. The Yellow Drawing Room has 18th century wall paper, which was supplied in 1817 for the Brighton Saloon, and the chimney piece in this room is a European vision of what the Chinese equivalent would look like, complete with nodding <a href="/wiki/Mandarin_%28bureaucrat%29.html" title="Mandarin (bureaucrat)">mandarins</a> in <a href="/wiki/Niche.html" title="Niche">niches</a> and fearsome winged <a href="/wiki/Chinese_dragon.html" title="Chinese dragon">dragons</a>.</p>

Running the length of the <i>piano nobile</i> of the east wing is an immense gallery, modestly known as the Principal Corridor.

</div>
<p>During the current reign court <a href="/wiki/Ceremony.html" title="Ceremony">ceremony</a> has undergone a radical change, and entry to the palace is no longer the prerogative of just the upper class.</p>
<p>There has been a progressive relaxation of the dress code governing formal <a href="/wiki/Court_uniform_and_dress.html" title="Court uniform and dress">court uniform and dress</a>. In previous reigns, men not wearing military <a href="/wiki/Uniform.html" title="Uniform">uniform</a> wore knee <a href="/wiki/Breeches.html" title="Breeches">breeches</a> of an 18th-century design. Women's evening dress included obligatory trains and <a href="/wiki/Tiara.html" title="Tiara">tiaras</a> and/or feathers in their hair. After <a href="/wiki/World_War_I.html" title="World War I">World War I</a>, when Queen Mary wished to follow <a href="/wiki/Fashion.html" title="Fashion">fashion</a> by raising her skirts a few inches from the ground, she requested a Lady-in-Waiting to shorten her own skirt first to gauge the King's reaction. King George V was horrified and Queen Mary's hemline remained unfashionably low. Subsequently, <a href="/wiki/George_VI_of_the_United_Kingdom.html" title="George VI of the United Kingdom">King George VI</a> and Queen Elizabeth allowed daytime skirts to rise.</p>
<p>In 1924 <a href="/wiki/Labour_Party_%28UK%29.html" title="Labour Party (UK)">Labour</a> <a href="/wiki/Prime_Minister.html" title="Prime Minister">Prime Minister</a> <a href="/wiki/Ramsay_MacDonald.html" title="Ramsay MacDonald">Ramsay MacDonald</a> was the first man to be received by a monarch inside the palace wearing a lounge <a href="/wiki/Suit.html" title="Suit">suit</a>; however, this was a one-off concession. Prescribed evening court dress remained obligatory until World War II.</p>
<p>Today there is no official dress code. Most men invited to Buckingham Palace in the daytime choose to wear service uniform or morning coats, and in the evening, depending on the formality of the occasion, <a href="/wiki/Black_tie.html" title="Black tie">black tie</a> or <a href="/wiki/White_tie.html" title="White tie">white tie</a>. If the occasion is 'white tie' then women, if they possess one, wear a tiara.</p>
<p>One of the first major changes was in 1958 when the Queen abolished the presentation parties for <a href="/wiki/Debutante.html" title="Debutante">debutantes</a>. These court presentations of <a href="/wiki/Aristocrat.html" title="Aristocrat">aristocratic</a> girls to the monarch took place in the <a href="/wiki/Throne_Room.html" title="Throne Room">Throne Room</a>. Debutantes wore full court dress, with three tall <a href="/wiki/Ostrich.html" title="Ostrich">ostrich</a> <a href="/wiki/Feather.html" title="Feather">feathers</a> in their hair. They entered, curtsied, performed a choreographed backwards walk and a further curtsey, while manoeuvring a dress train of prescribed length. The ceremony corresponded to the "<a href="/wiki/Drawing_room.html" title="Drawing room">court drawing rooms</a>" of earlier reigns, and Queen Elizabeth II replaced the presentations with large and frequent palace garden parties for an invited cross-section of British society. The late <a href="/wiki/Princess_Margaret%2C_Countess_of_Snowdon.html" title="Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon">Princess Margaret</a> is reputed to have remarked of the debutante presentations: "We had to put a stop to it, every tart in London was getting in" <sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a  title="">[7]</a></sup>.

<p>State <a href="/wiki/Banquet.html" title="Banquet">banquets</a> also take place in the Ballroom. These formal dinners take place on the first evening of a state visit by a visiting Head of State. On these occasions, often over 150 guests in formal "white tie and decorations" including tiaras for women, dine off gold plate. The largest and most formal reception at Buckingham Palace takes place every November, when the Queen entertains members of the foreign <a href="/wiki/Diplomat.html" title="Diplomat">diplomatic</a> corps resident in London. On this occasion all the state rooms are in use, as the entire Royal Family proceed through them, beginning their procession through the great north doors of the Picture Gallery. As Nash had envisaged, all the large, double-mirrored doors stand open, reflecting the numerous crystal chandeliers and sconces, causing a deliberate optical illusion of space and light.</p>
<p>Smaller ceremonies such as the reception of new ambassadors take place in the '1844 Room'. Here too the Queen holds small lunch parties, and often meetings of the <a href="/wiki/Privy_Council_of_the_United_Kingdom.html" title="Privy Council of the United Kingdom">Privy Council</a>. Larger lunch parties often take place in the curved and <a href="/wiki/Dome.html" title="Dome">domed</a> Music Room, or the State Dining Room. On all formal occasions the ceremonies are attended by the <a href="/wiki/Yeomen_of_the_Guard.html" title="Yeomen of the Guard">Yeomen of the Guard</a> in their anachronistic uniforms, and other officers of the court such as the <a href="/wiki/Lord_Chamberlain.html" title="Lord Chamberlain">Lord Chamberlain</a>.</p>
<p>Since the bombing of the palace chapel in World War II, royal christenings have sometimes taken place in the Music Room. The Queen's first three children were all baptised here, in a special gold font. <a href="/wiki/Prince_William_of_Wales.html" title="Prince William of Wales">Prince William</a> was christened in the Music Room; however, his brother, Prince Harry, was christened at <a href="/wiki/St_George%27s_Chapel%2C_Windsor.html" title="St George's Chapel, Windsor">St George's Chapel, Windsor</a>.</p>
<p>The largest functions of the year are the garden parties for up to 8,000 invitees, taking tea and sandwiches outdoors in a series of marquees. The guests first assemble, then as a military band plays the <a href="/wiki/National_Anthem.html" title="National Anthem">National Anthem</a>, the Queen emerges from the Bow Room, and slowly walks through the guests, greeting those previously selected for the honour, to her own more private tea tent. If the guests at these functions do not actually have the opportunity to meet the Queen, they at least have the consolation of being able to admire the gardens.</p>

The east front of Buckingham Palace was completed in 1850. Seen here in 1910, it was remodelled to its present form in 1913</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>In 1901 the accession of <a href="/wiki/King_Edward_VII_of_the_United_Kingdom.html" title="King Edward VII of the United Kingdom">Edward VII</a> saw new life breathed into the palace. The new King and his wife <a href="/wiki/Alexandra_of_Denmark.html" title="Alexandra of Denmark">Queen Alexandra</a> had always been at the forefront of London high society, and their friends, known as "the <a href="/wiki/Marlborough_House.html" title="Marlborough House">Marlborough House</a> Set", were considered to be the most eminent and fashionable of the age. Buckingham Palace—the Ballroom, Grand Entrance, Marble Hall, Grand Staircase, vestibules and galleries redecorated in the <a href="/wiki/Belle_epoque.html" title="Belle epoque">Belle epoque</a> cream and gold colour scheme they retain today—once again became the focal point of the <a href="/wiki/British_Empire.html" title="British Empire">British Empire</a> and a setting for entertaining on a majestic scale. Many people feel King Edward's heavy redecoration of the palace does not complement Nash's original work.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a  title="">[8]</a></sup> However, it has been allowed to remain for one hundred years.</p>
<p>The last major building work took place during the reign of <a href="/wiki/George_V_of_the_United_Kingdom.html" title="George V of the United Kingdom">King George V</a> when, in 1913, <a href="/wiki/Aston_Webb.html" title="Aston Webb">Sir Aston Webb</a> redesigned Blore's 1850 East Front to resemble in part <a href="/wiki/Giacomo_Leoni.html" title="Giacomo Leoni">Giacomo Leoni</a>'s <a href="/wiki/Lyme_Park.html" title="Lyme Park">Lyme Park</a> in <a href="/wiki/Cheshire.html" title="Cheshire">Cheshire</a>. This new, refaced principal facade (of <a href="/wiki/Portland_stone.html" title="Portland stone">Portland stone</a>) was designed to be the backdrop to the <a href="/wiki/Victoria_Memorial_%28London%29.html" title="Victoria Memorial (London)">Victoria Memorial</a>, a large memorial statue of Queen Victoria, placed outside the main gates. George V, who had succeeded Edward VII in 1910, had a more serious personality than his father; greater emphasis was now placed on official entertaining and royal duties than on lavish parties. George V's wife <a href="/wiki/Mary_of_Teck.html" title="Mary of Teck">Queen Mary</a> was a <a href="/wiki/Connoisseur.html" title="Connoisseur">connoisseur</a> of the arts, and took a keen interest in the Royal collection of furniture and art, both restoring and adding to it. Queen Mary also had many new fixtures and fittings installed, such as the pair of marble <a href="/wiki/Empire_style.html" title="Empire style">Empire-style</a> chimneypieces by <a  class="new" title="Benjamin Vulliamy">Benjamin Vulliamy</a>, dating from 1810, which the Queen had installed in the ground floor Bow Room, the huge low room at the centre of the garden facade. Queen Mary was also responsible for the decoration of the Blue Drawing Room. This room, 69 <a href="/wiki/Foot_%28unit_of_length%29.html" title="Foot (unit of length)">feet</a> (21 <a href="/wiki/Metre.html" title="Metre">m</a>) long, previously known as the South Drawing Room, has one of Nash's finest ceilings, coffered with huge gilt <a href="/wiki/Console.html" title="Console">console</a> brackets, and is referred to by the author and historian <a  class="new" title="Olwen Hedley">Olwen Hedley</a> in her book <i>Buckingham Palace</i> as the most beautiful in the palace, grander and more lavish than either the <a href="/wiki/Throne_Room.html" title="Throne Room">Throne Room</a> or the Ballroom, which was built to take over the Blue Drawing Room's original function.</p>

<p>The last major extension to the palace was in 1850. In 1999 it was stated <sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a  title="">[9]</a></sup>the palace contained 19 state rooms, 52 principal bedrooms, 188 staff bedrooms, 92 offices, and 78 bathrooms. While this may seem large, it is small compared with the <a href="/wiki/Tsar.html" title="Tsar">Tsar</a>'s palaces in <a href="/wiki/Saint_Petersburg.html" title="Saint Petersburg">St. Petersburg</a> and at <a href="/wiki/Tsarskoe_Selo.html" title="Tsarskoe Selo">Tsarskoe Selo</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Papal_Palace.html" title="Papal Palace">Papal Palace</a> in <a href="/wiki/Rome.html" title="Rome">Rome</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Royal_Palace_of_Madrid.html" title="Royal Palace of Madrid">Royal Palace of Madrid</a>, or indeed the former <a href="/wiki/Palace_of_Whitehall.html" title="Palace of Whitehall">Palace of Whitehall</a>, and tiny compared to the <a href="/wiki/Forbidden_City.html" title="Forbidden City">Forbidden City</a> and <a href="/wiki/Potala_Palace.html" title="Potala Palace">Potala Palace</a>. The relative smallness of the palace may be best appreciated from within, looking out over the inner quadrangle. A minor extension was made in 1938, in which the north-west pavilion, designed by Nash, was converted into a swimming pool.</p>
<p>During <a href="/wiki/World_War_I.html" title="World War I">World War I</a> the Palace, then the home of King George V and Queen Mary, escaped unscathed. Its more valuable contents were evacuated to Windsor but the Royal family remained <i>in situ</i>. The largest change to court life at this time was that the Government persuaded the King to ostentatiously and publicly lock the wine cellars and refrain from alcohol for the duration of the war, to set a good example to the supposedly inebriated lower classes. The lower classes continued to imbibe and the King was left reputedly furious at his enforced abstinence. Edward VIII later told a biographer that his father had a furtive glass of port each evening, while the Queen secretly laced her fruit cup with <a href="/wiki/Champagne_%28beverage%29.html" title="Champagne (beverage)">champagne</a>. The King's children were photographed at this time serving tea to wounded officers in the adjacent Royal Mews.</p>
<p>During <a href="/wiki/World_War_II.html" title="World War II">World War II</a> the Palace fared worse: it was bombed no less than seven times, and was a deliberate target, as it was thought by the <a href="/wiki/Nazism.html" title="Nazism">Nazis</a> that the destruction of Buckingham Palace would demoralise the nation. One bomb fell in the palace quadrangle while King George VI and Queen Elizabeth were in residence, but while many windows were blown in, no serious damage was reported. However, war time coverage of such incidents was severely restricted. The most serious and publicised bombing was the destruction of the Palace chapel in 1940: coverage of this event was played in cinemas all over England to show the common suffering of rich and poor. The King and Queen were filmed inspecting their bombed home, the smiling Queen immaculate in a hat and matching coat. It was at this time the Queen famously declared: "I'm glad we have been bombed. Now I can look the East End in the face". The Royal family were seen as sharing their subjects' hardship, as <a  class="new" title="The Sunday Graphic">The Sunday Graphic</a> reported:-</p>

<h4>Security</h4>
<p>Today though Royal security is high, it is better known for a series of high-profile intrusions, both at the Palace and elsewhere. The famous armed <a href="/wiki/Sentry.html" title="Sentry">sentries</a> on <a href="/wiki/Queen%27s_Guard.html" title="Queen's Guard">guard</a> at the front of the palace are commonly thought to be ceremonial, but they have always had a security role.

<p>Most lapses of security have been outside the palace: In 1974, <a  class="new" title="Ian Ball">Ian Ball</a> attempted to kidnap <a href="/wiki/Anne%2C_Princess_Royal.html" title="Anne, Princess Royal">the Princess Royal</a> at gunpoint in <a href="/wiki/The_Mall_%28London%29.html" title="The Mall (London)">the Mall</a> while she was returning to the palace, wounding several people in the process. In 1981, three <a href="/wiki/Germany.html" title="Germany">German</a> tourists camped in the <a href="/wiki/Buckingham_Palace_Gardens.html" title="Buckingham Palace Gardens">gardens of the palace</a>, after climbing over the heavily barbwired wall, purportedly believing the area to be <a href="/wiki/Hyde_Park.html" title="Hyde Park">Hyde Park</a>. In 1993, anti-nuclear protestors also scaled the palace walls and held a sit down protest on the palace lawn. Most notably, in 1994, a naked <a href="/wiki/Paraglider.html" title="Paraglider">paraglider</a> landed on the roof of the building. In 1995 a student, <a  class="new" title="John Gillard">John Gillard</a>, was able to deliberately ram the gates of the palace, knocking one of the great <a href="/wiki/Wrought_iron.html" title="Wrought iron">wrought iron</a> gates weighing 3,300 pounds (1.5 tonnes) off its hinges. In 1997, an absconded mentally ill patient was found wandering the palace grounds, which ordered another security review.</p>
<p>Most recently, in <a href="/wiki/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>, <a href="/wiki/Fathers_4_Justice_Buckingham_Palace_protest#Buckingham_Palace_protest.html" title="Fathers 4 Justice Buckingham Palace protest">a protester</a> advocating the legal rights of <a href="/wiki/Fathers_4_Justice.html" title="Fathers 4 Justice">single fathers</a>, received wide press coverage when he climbed onto a ledge near the ceremonial balcony on the east front dressed as <a href="/wiki/Batman.html" title="Batman">Batman</a>. In the same incident, a second protester, dressed as <a href="/wiki/Robin_%28comics%29.html" title="Robin (comics)">Robin</a>, was apprehended before he managed to climb onto the building; <a  class="external text" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4035987.stm">he returned</a> the following November dressed as <a href="/wiki/Father_Christmas.html" title="Father Christmas">Father Christmas</a> to chain himself to a lamp on one of the main gateposts.</p>
<p>Historically, there have been many other lapses. Probably the most incredible was in 1837, when a 12-year-old boy known to history as <a  class="new" title="The boy Cotton">The boy Cotton</a> managed to live for a year undetected inside the palace.

<p>Today, Buckingham Palace is not only the home of the Queen and Prince Philip but also the London residence of the <a href="/wiki/Prince_Andrew_of_the_United_Kingdom.html" title="Prince Andrew of the United Kingdom">Duke of York</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Prince_Edward%2C_Earl_of_Wessex.html" title="Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex">Earl and Countess of Wessex</a>. The palace also houses the office of the monarchy and its associated functions.</p>
<p>In addition to being the weekday home of the Queen and the <a href="/wiki/Prince_Philip%2C_Duke_of_Edinburgh.html" title="Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh">Duke of Edinburgh</a>, the palace is the workplace of 450 people. Every year some 50,000 people are entertained at garden parties, receptions, audiences, and banquets. The forecourt of Buckingham Palace is used for <a href="/wiki/Changing_of_the_Guard.html" title="Changing of the Guard">Changing of the Guard</a>, a major ceremony and tourist attraction (daily during the summer months; every other day during the winter).</p>
<p>The palace is not the private property of the Queen; Windsor Castle and Buckingham Palace and their art collections belong to the nation. The priceless furnishings, paintings, fittings and other artefacts, many by <a href="/wiki/Peter_Carl_Faberg%C3%A9.html" title="Peter Carl Fabergé">Fabergé</a>, from Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle are known collectively as the <a href="/wiki/Royal_Collection.html" title="Royal Collection">Royal Collection</a>; owned by the <a href="/wiki/Nation.html" title="Nation">nation</a>, they can be viewed by the public when the palace and castle are open to the public at various times of the year. The <a href="/wiki/Queen%27s_Gallery.html" title="Queen's Gallery">Queen's Gallery</a> near the <a href="/wiki/Royal_Mews.html" title="Royal Mews">Royal Mews</a> is open all year and displays a changing selection of items from the collection. The rooms containing the Queen's Gallery are on the site of the former chapel, which was damaged by one of the seven bombs to fall on the Palace during <a href="/wiki/World_War_II.html" title="World War II">World War II</a>.</p>

The tarmac's reddish colour recalls the red carpets of former times.

The processions pass through Admiralty Arch and into the Mall, which is always closed for the occasion.</p>
<p>The Summer Opening of the Palace <a  class="new" title="State Room">State Rooms</a> to the public was a huge change to tradition in the 1990s. The money raised in entry fees was originally put towards the rebuilding of <a href="/wiki/Windsor_Castle.html" title="Windsor Castle">Windsor Castle</a> following the fire that destroyed many of its State Rooms. Each Summer, during August and September, the West Wing of the Palace is opened to the public. A staff of about 200, mainly students, is employed to run the Opening in such areas as 'Queue', 'Visitor Entrance', 'Security', 'Baggage', 'State Rooms', 'Access' and 'Garden'. The visitor route for 2006 onwards is currently being updated for reasons of presentation and security.</p>

<h2>Big Royal Dig Graphic Reconstructions of Buckingham Palace History</h2>
<p>As part of the Queen's 80th birthday celebrations, the Big Royal Dig carried out by the <a href="/wiki/Time_Team.html" title="Time Team">Time Team</a> of archaeologists (see <a href="/wiki/Buckingham_Palace_Gardens.html" title="Buckingham Palace Gardens">Buckingham Palace Gardens</a> for full findings) from 25th-28th August 2006 produced some spectacular graphic reconstructions of Buckingham Palace history.</p>
<p><a  class="external text" title="http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/B/big_royal_dig/buck_pal/gallery_11_buck_maps3.html">Graphic Reconstruction 1</a> shows the familiar East Front of Buckingham Palace removed (in the background of the picture). The processional arch designed by architect <a href="/wiki/John_Nash_%28architect%29.html" title="John Nash (architect)">John Nash</a>, which was resited at <a href="/wiki/Marble_Arch.html" title="Marble Arch">Marble Arch</a> in London, has been digitally replaced in its <a  class="external text" title="http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/B/big_royal_dig/buck_pal/gallery_6_buck_maps.html">original site</a>. (It was removed as being too small for Queen Victoria's carriage.)</p>
<p><a  class="external text" title="http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/B/big_royal_dig/buck_pal/gallery_12_buck_maps3.html">Graphic Reconstruction 2</a> combines architect John Nash's Palace building with the original Buckingham House wing. (The more familiar East Front of the Palace is out of frame on the right of shot.)</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the Big Royal Dig did not succeed in unearthing traces of three prior residences erected on the Palace site, namely Buckingham House (1703), Arlington House (1674) and Goring House (1633).</p>
