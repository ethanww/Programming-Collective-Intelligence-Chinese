<p>The <b>Polish–Soviet War</b> (February 1919 – March 1921) was an armed conflict between <a href="/wiki/Russian_SFSR.html" title="Russian SFSR">Soviet Russia</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Second_Polish_Republic.html" title="Second Polish Republic">Second Polish Republic</a>, two nascent states in post-<a href="/wiki/World_War_I.html" title="World War I">World War I</a> <a href="/wiki/Europe.html" title="Europe">Europe</a>. The war was a result of conflicting expansionist attempts — by Poland, whose statehood had just been re-established following the <a href="/wiki/Partitions_of_Poland.html" title="Partitions of Poland">Partitions of Poland</a> in the late 18th century, to secure territories which she had lost at the time of partitions or earlier — and by the Soviets, who aimed at control of the same territories, which had been part of <a href="/wiki/Imperial_Russia.html" title="Imperial Russia">Imperial Russia</a> until the turbulent events of the <a href="/wiki/World_War_I.html" title="World War I">Great War</a>. Both states claimed victory<sup id="_ref-result_1" class="reference"><a  title="">[1]</a></sup> in the war: the Poles claimed a successful defense of their state, while the Soviets claimed a repulse of the Polish <a href="/wiki/Kiev_Offensive.html" title="Kiev Offensive">eastward invasion of Ukraine</a> and Belarus viewed by them as a part of <a href="/wiki/Allied_Intervention_in_the_Russian_Civil_War.html" title="Allied Intervention in the Russian Civil War">foreign interventions in the Russian Civil War</a>.</p>
<p>The frontiers between Poland and Soviet Russia had not been defined in the <a href="/wiki/Treaty_of_Versailles.html" title="Treaty of Versailles">Treaty of Versailles</a> and were further rendered chaotic by the <a href="/wiki/Russian_Revolution_of_1917.html" title="Russian Revolution of 1917">Russian Revolution of 1917</a>, crumbling of the <a href="/wiki/Imperial_Russia.html" title="Imperial Russia">Russian</a>, <a href="/wiki/German_Empire.html" title="German Empire">German</a> and <a href="/wiki/Austria-Hungary.html" title="Austria-Hungary">Austrian</a> empires, the <a href="/wiki/Russian_Civil_War.html" title="Russian Civil War">Russian Civil War</a>, <a href="/wiki/Central_Powers.html" title="Central Powers">Central Powers</a>' withdrawal from the <a href="/wiki/Eastern_Front_%28World_War_I%29.html" title="Eastern Front (World War I)">eastern front</a>, and the attempts of <a href="/wiki/Ukrainian_People%27s_Republic.html" title="Ukrainian People's Republic">Ukraine</a> and <a href="/wiki/Belarusian_National_Republic.html" title="Belarusian National Republic">Belarus</a> to establish their independence. Poland's <a href="/wiki/Chief_of_State.html" title="Chief of State">Chief of State</a>, <a href="/wiki/J%C3%B3zef_Pi%C5%82sudski.html" title="Józef Piłsudski">Józef Piłsudski</a>, realized the expediency of using the moment to expand the Polish borders as much to the east as feasible followed by the creation of the Polish-led federation (<a href="/wiki/Mi%C4%99dzymorze.html" title="Międzymorze">Międzymorze</a>) of several states in the rest of East-Central Europe as a bulwark against the potential reemergence of both German and Russian <a href="/wiki/Imperialism.html" title="Imperialism">imperialism</a>. On the other hand, <a href="/wiki/Vladimir_Lenin.html" title="Vladimir Lenin">Lenin</a> saw Poland as the bridge that the <a href="/wiki/Red_Army.html" title="Red Army">Red Army</a> would have to cross in order to assist <a href="/wiki/Communist_Party_of_Germany.html" title="Communist Party of Germany">other communist movements</a> and help conduct other European revolutions.</p>
<p>By 1919, the Polish forces had taken control over much of Western Ukraine, <a href="/wiki/Polish-Ukrainian_War.html" title="Polish-Ukrainian War">having won the conflict</a> with <a href="/wiki/West_Ukrainian_People%27s_Republic.html" title="West Ukrainian People's Republic">West Ukrainian People's Republic</a> that tried to create a Ukrainian state on territories to which both Poles and the Ukrainians laid claim. Meanwhile, the Bolsheviks began to gain the upper hand in the Russian Civil War and advance westward towards the disputed territories and by the end of 1919 a clear front had formed. Border skirmishes then escalated into open warfare following Piłsudski's <a href="/wiki/Kiev_Offensive.html" title="Kiev Offensive">major incursion further east into Ukraine</a> (April 1920). He was met by a nearly simultaneous Red Army <a href="/wiki/Counterattack.html" title="Counterattack">counterattack</a>, initially very successful. The Soviet operation threw the Polish forces back westward all the way to the Polish capital, <a href="/wiki/Warsaw.html" title="Warsaw">Warsaw</a>. Meanwhile, western fears of Soviet troops arriving at the German frontiers <a href="/wiki/Interallied_Mission_to_Poland.html" title="Interallied Mission to Poland">increased the interest of Western powers</a> in the war. In midsummer, the fall of Warsaw seemed certain but in mid-August the tide had turned again as the Polish forces achieved an unexpected and decisive victory at the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Warsaw_%281920%29.html" title="Battle of Warsaw (1920)">Battle of Warsaw</a>. In the wake of the Polish advance eastward, Soviets sued for peace and the war ended with a <a href="/wiki/Ceasefire.html" title="Ceasefire">ceasefire</a> in October 1920. A formal <a href="/wiki/Peace_treaty.html" title="Peace treaty">peace treaty</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Peace_of_Riga.html" title="Peace of Riga">Peace of Riga</a>, was signed on <a href="/wiki/March_18.html" title="March 18">18 March</a> <a href="/wiki/1921.html" title="1921">1921</a>, dividing the disputed territories between Poland and Soviet Russia. Thus, this 1919–1920 war has largely determined the Soviet-Polish border for the <a href="/wiki/Interbellum.html" title="Interbellum">period between the World Wars</a>.</p>

<p><a name="Names_and_dates_of_the_war" id="Names_and_dates_of_the_war"></a></p>
<h2>Names and dates of the war</h2>
<p>The war is referred to by several names. "Polish–Soviet War" may be the most common, but is potentially confusing since "Soviet" is usually thought of as relating to the <a href="/wiki/Soviet_Union.html" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a>, which (by contrast with "<a href="/wiki/Russian_Soviet_Federated_Socialist_Republic.html" title="Russian Soviet Federated Socialist Republic">Soviet Russia</a>") did not officially come into being until December 1922. Alternative names include "Russo-Polish War<sup id="_ref-EB_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[2]</a></sup> [or Polish-Russian War] of 1919–20/21" (to distinguish it from earlier Polish-Russian wars) and "Polish-Bolshevik War." This second term (or just "Bolshevik War" (<a href="/wiki/Polish_language.html" title="Polish language">Polish</a>: <i>Wojna bolszewicka</i>)) is most common in Polish sources. In some Polish sources it has also come down as the "War of 1920" (Polish: <i>Wojna 1920 roku</i>), while Soviet historians often either called it the "War against White Poland" or considered it a part of the <a href="/wiki/Allied_Intervention_in_the_Russian_Civil_War.html" title="Allied Intervention in the Russian Civil War">Allied Intervention in the Russian Civil War</a> or of the <a href="/wiki/Russian_Civil_War.html" title="Russian Civil War">Civil War</a> itself.</p>
<p>A second controversy revolves around the starting date of the war. For example, <a href="/wiki/Encyclopedia_Britannica.html" title="Encyclopedia Britannica">Encyclopedia Britannica</a> considers the <a href="/wiki/Kiev_Offensive.html" title="Kiev Offensive">Polish thrust into Ukraine</a> as the starting point of the war.<sup id="_ref-EB_1" class="reference"><a  title="">[2]</a></sup>, while some historians — like <a href="/wiki/Norman_Davies.html" title="Norman Davies">Norman Davies</a><sup id="_ref-Davies_WERS_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[3]</a></sup> — give the year 1919 as the starting year of the war. Finally, the ending dates are given as either 1920 or 1921; this confusion stems from the fact that while the <a href="/wiki/Ceasefire.html" title="Ceasefire">ceasefire</a> was put in force in fall 1920, the <a href="/wiki/Treaty_of_Riga.html" title="Treaty of Riga">official treaty ending the war</a> was signed months later, in 1921.</p>
<p>While the events of 1919 can be described as a border conflict and only in early 1920 did both sides realize that they were in fact engaged in an all-out war, the conflicts that took place in 1919 are closely related to the war that began in earnest a year later. In the end, the events of 1920 were only a logical, though unforeseen, consequence of the 1919 prelude.</p>

Rebirth of Poland, March 1919</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>In 1919, with the end of the <a href="/wiki/World_War_I.html" title="World War I">First World War</a>, the map of <a href="/wiki/Central_Europe.html" title="Central Europe">Central</a> and <a href="/wiki/Eastern_Europe.html" title="Eastern Europe">Eastern Europe</a> had drastically changed. As Germany's defeat rendered its plans for the creation of the <a href="/wiki/Mitteleuropa.html" title="Mitteleuropa">Mitteleuropa</a> <a href="/wiki/Puppet_state.html" title="Puppet state">puppet states</a> obsolete, and as Russia sank into the depths of the <a href="/wiki/Russian_Civil_War.html" title="Russian Civil War">Russian Civil War</a>, many nations of that region saw a chance for real independence and were not prepared to easily relinquish this rare opportunity.</p>
<p>At the same time, the Russians saw these territories as rebellious Russian provinces, vital for Russian security, <sup id="_ref-Cienciala_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[4]</a></sup> but were unable to react swiftly, as, weakened by the World War, their Empire collapsed into the <a href="/wiki/Russian_Revolution_of_1917.html" title="Russian Revolution of 1917">Revolution</a> and <a href="/wiki/Russian_Civil_War.html" title="Russian Civil War">Civil War</a> that raged there from 1917.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, with the success of the <a href="/wiki/Wielkopolska_Uprising_%281918%E2%80%931919%29.html" title="Wielkopolska Uprising (1918–1919)">Greater Poland Uprising in 1918</a>, Poland had reestablished its <a href="/wiki/Statehood.html" title="Statehood">statehood</a> for the first time since the <a href="/wiki/Partitions_of_Poland#Third_Partition.html" title="Partitions of Poland">1795 partition</a> which brought 123 years of Poland being ruled by its three imperial neighbors. The country reborn as a <a href="/wiki/Second_Polish_Republic.html" title="Second Polish Republic">Second Polish Republic</a> proceeded to carve out its borders from the territories of its former partitioners, <a href="/wiki/Imperial_Russia.html" title="Imperial Russia">Russia</a>, <a href="/wiki/German_Empire.html" title="German Empire">Germany</a> and <a href="/wiki/Austria-Hungary.html" title="Austria-Hungary">Austria-Hungary</a>.</p>
<p>Poland, however, was not alone in its newfound opportunities and troubles. Soon, virtually all of the newly independent neighbours began fighting over borders: <a href="/wiki/Kingdom_of_Romania.html" title="Kingdom of Romania">Romania</a> fought with <a href="/wiki/Hungary.html" title="Hungary">Hungary</a> over <a href="/wiki/Transylvania.html" title="Transylvania">Transylvania</a>, <a href="/wiki/Kingdom_of_Yugoslavia.html" title="Kingdom of Yugoslavia">Yugoslavia</a> with <a href="/wiki/Italy.html" title="Italy">Italy</a> over <a href="/wiki/Rijeka.html" title="Rijeka">Rijeka</a>, Poland with <a href="/wiki/Czechoslovakia.html" title="Czechoslovakia">Czechoslovakia</a> over <a href="/wiki/Cieszyn.html" title="Cieszyn">Cieszyn/Těšín</a>, with Germany over <a href="/wiki/Pozna%C5%84.html" title="Poznań">Poznań</a> and <a href="/wiki/Polish-Ukrainian_War.html" title="Polish-Ukrainian War">with Ukrainians</a> over <a href="/wiki/Eastern_Galicia.html" title="Eastern Galicia">Eastern Galicia</a>. <a href="/wiki/Ukrainian_People%27s_Republic.html" title="Ukrainian People's Republic">Ukrainians</a>, Belarusians, <a href="/wiki/Freedom_wars_of_Lithuania.html" title="Freedom wars of Lithuania">Lithuanians</a>, <a href="/wiki/Estonian_Liberation_War.html" title="Estonian Liberation War">Estonians</a> and <a href="/wiki/Latvian_War_of_Liberation.html" title="Latvian War of Liberation">Latvians</a> fought against themselves and against the Russians, who were <a href="/wiki/Russian_Civil_War.html" title="Russian Civil War">just as divided</a>. Spreading communist influences also added to this mix, resulting in communists revolutions in <a href="/wiki/Munich.html" title="Munich">Munich</a>, <a href="/wiki/Berlin.html" title="Berlin">Berlin</a>, <a href="/wiki/Budapest.html" title="Budapest">Budapest</a> and <a href="/wiki/Ko%C5%A1ice.html" title="Košice">Košice</a>. <a href="/wiki/Winston_Churchill.html" title="Winston Churchill">Winston Churchill</a> commented on this situation: <i>The war of giants has ended, the wars of the pygmies begin</i><sup id="_ref-AHP_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[5]</a></sup>. He was mostly correct; all of those engagements – with the sole exception of the Polish-Soviet war – would be shortlived border conflicts, insignificant in the greater scheme of things.</p>
<p>The Polish-Soviet war likely happened more by accident than by design. It is unlikely that anyone in Soviet Russia or in the new Second Republic of Poland would have deliberately planned a major foreign war. Poland, its territory a major frontline of the First World War, was unstable politically and having just won a difficult <a href="/wiki/Polish-Ukrainian_War.html" title="Polish-Ukrainian War">conflict with Ukrainians for Eastern Galicia</a> was already engaged in new conflicts with Germany (the <a href="/wiki/Silesian_Uprisings.html" title="Silesian Uprisings">Silesian Uprisings</a>) and <a href="/wiki/Border_conflicts_between_Poland_and_Czechoslovakia.html" title="Border conflicts between Poland and Czechoslovakia">with Czechoslovakia</a>, while the attention and policies of revolutionary Russia were predominantly directed at <a href="/wiki/Russian_Civil_War.html" title="Russian Civil War">dealing with counter-revolution</a> and with <a href="/wiki/Allied_Intervention_in_the_Russian_Civil_War.html" title="Allied Intervention in the Russian Civil War">intervention by the western powers</a>. While the first clashes between Polish and Soviet forces occurred in February 1919, it would be almost a year before both sides fully realised that they were engaged in an all-out war.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>All began to change in late 1919, when <a href="/wiki/Vladimir_Lenin.html" title="Vladimir Lenin">Vladimir Lenin</a>, leader of Russia's new <a href="/wiki/Communist.html" title="Communist">communist</a> government, inspired by the Red Army's civil-war victories over <a href="/wiki/White_Russian.html" title="White Russian">White Russian</a> anticommunist forces and their western allies on Russian territory started to see the future of the revolution with the greater optimism. The Bolsheviks, although they still had lots of internal problems, acted on a conviction<i><sup>(<a  title="Wikipedia:Disputed statement">dubious assertion</a><font class="metadata">—see <a  title="Talk:Polish-Soviet War">talk page</a></font>)</sup></i> that historical processes would soon lead to rule of the <a href="/wiki/Proletariat.html" title="Proletariat">proletariat</a> in all nations, and that the withering away of <a href="/wiki/Nation.html" title="Nation">national</a> <a href="/wiki/State.html" title="State">states</a> would eventually bring about a worldwide communist community. One of the arguments for the inevitability of the coming war with Poland laid in the Bolsheviks’ avowed intent to link their revolution in Russia with an expected <a href="/wiki/German_Revolution.html" title="German Revolution">revolution in Germany</a>. Poland, due to its geographical location, was the bridge that the <a href="/wiki/Red_Army.html" title="Red Army">Red Army</a> would have to cross in order to link the two revolutions and to assist other communist movements in <a href="/wiki/Western_Europe.html" title="Western Europe">Western Europe</a><sup id="_ref-Cienciala_1" class="reference"><a  title="">[4]</a></sup>. As Lenin himself remarked, "That was the time when everyone in Germany, including the darkest reactionaries and monarchists, declared that the Bolsheviks would be their salvation."<sup title="The text in the vicinity of this tag needs citation." class="noprint">[<a  title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><i>citation&#160;needed</i></a>]</sup> The Bolshevik government claimed to support the "<a href="/wiki/Self-determination.html" title="Self-determination">self-determination</a>" of all the non-Russian peoples of the former Russian Empire. However, they meant self-determination by workers and peasants led by native communists sent in from Moscow.<sup id="_ref-Cienciala_2" class="reference"><a  title="">[4]</a></sup> Lenin’s aim was to infiltrate the borderlands, set up communist governments there as well as in Poland, and reach Germany where he expected a socialist revolution to break out. He also expected revolutions elsewhere, including Italy, but the German revolution was most important to him for he believed that Soviet Russia could not survive without the support of a socialist Germany and the help of its industrial know-how to modernize Russia.<sup id="_ref-Cienciala_3" class="reference"><a  title="">[4]</a></sup> By 1918 the Soviets managed to take over most of Ukraine, driving out the Ukrainian government from Kiev, and they also set up a "<a href="/wiki/Lithuanian-Belorussian_Republic.html" title="Lithuanian-Belorussian Republic">Lithuanian-Belorussian Republic</a>" (Litbel) in early 1919, with its government in <a href="/wiki/Vilnius.html" title="Vilnius">Vilnius</a>. It was run by native communists sent there by Moscow and supported by Red Army units. This government made itself very unpopular due to confiscation of food and goods for the army, as well as terror.<sup id="_ref-Cienciala_4" class="reference"><a  title="">[4]</a></sup> It was however not until the Soviet victories in the first half of 1920 that some of the Soviet leaders would see the war as the real opportunity to spread the revolution westwards. <sup id="_ref-Cienciala_5" class="reference"><a  title="">[4]</a></sup> <sup id="_ref-Suny_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>In the meantime, Polish politics were under the strong influence of Piłsudski, chief of state (<i><a href="/wiki/Naczelnik_pa%C5%84stwa.html" title="Naczelnik państwa">naczelnik państwa</a></i>)<sup id="_ref-Enc_Pils_1" class="reference"><a  title="">[6]</a></sup>. Piłsudski at that time wanted to create a Polish-led<sup id="_ref-Roshwald1_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[8]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Debo1_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[9]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Billington1_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[10]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Pacz1_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[11]</a></sup> "<a href="/wiki/Mi%C4%99dzymorze.html" title="Międzymorze">Międzymorze</a> Federation" comprised of an expanded Poland, <a href="/wiki/Lithuania.html" title="Lithuania">Lithuania</a> and <a href="/wiki/Ukraine.html" title="Ukraine">Ukraine</a> and other <a href="/wiki/Central_Europe.html" title="Central Europe">Central</a> and <a href="/wiki/East_Europe.html" title="East Europe">East European</a> countries now emerging out of crumbling empires after the First World War.<sup id="_ref-Brzez_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[12]</a></sup> While some scholars take the proclaimed democracy, freedom and the voluntarily principles of the federation planned by Pilsudski at face value<sup id="_ref-AvRo_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[13]</a></sup> others view such proclamations with scepticism pointing out that in his later life Piłsudski himself becomed increasingly disillusioned with the <a href="/wiki/Democracy.html" title="Democracy">democracy</a>.<sup id="_ref-Cohen2_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[14]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Billington1_1" class="reference"><a  title="">[10]</a></sup>. Many Ukrainian writers, both modern and contemporary saw the federation as the project of mega-Poland where the interests of non-Poles, particularly the Ukrainians, were to be disregarded.<sup id="_ref-Derh_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[15]</a></sup> According to its originator, this new union was to become a counterweight to any potential <a href="/wiki/Imperialist.html" title="Imperialist">imperialist</a> intentions on the part of Russia or Germany. However, Piłsudski's vision was opposed not only by foreign nationalist and imperialist politics<sup id="_ref-Polonica_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[16]</a></sup> but even in reborn Poland where he was opposed by <a href="/wiki/Roman_Dmowski.html" title="Roman Dmowski">Roman Dmowski</a>, who prevailed with his view of a smaller, ethnically purer Poland, where all minorities would be <a href="/wiki/Polonized.html" title="Polonized">Polonized</a>.<sup id="_ref-BFG_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[17]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-DmowskiQuote_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[18]</a></sup> Piłsudski, who specifically argued that "There can be no independent Poland without an independent Ukraine", really meant Ukraine being split from Russia rather than had any real concern for the fate of the Ukrainians.<sup id="_ref-PolSize_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[19]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-FreeFromRU_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[20]</a></sup> He did not hesitate to use military force to <a href="/wiki/Polish-Ukrainian_War.html" title="Polish-Ukrainian War">expand the Polish borders</a> to <a href="/wiki/Galicia_%28Central_Europe%29.html" title="Galicia (Central Europe)">Galicia</a> and <a href="/wiki/Volhynia.html" title="Volhynia">Volhynia</a>, crushing a <a href="/wiki/West_Ukrainian_People%27s_Republic.html" title="West Ukrainian People's Republic">Ukrainian attempt at self-determination</a> in the disputed territories east of the <a href="/wiki/Western_Bug.html" title="Western Bug">Western Bug</a> river, which contained a significant Polish minority<sup id="_ref-Cienciala_6" class="reference"><a  title="">[4]</a></sup>, mainly in cities like <a href="/wiki/Lw%C3%B3w.html" title="Lwów">Lwów</a> (Lviv), but a Ukrainian majority in the countryside.

<p>In 1918 the German Army in the east, under the command of <a href="/wiki/Max_Hoffmann.html" title="Max Hoffmann">Max Hoffmann</a>, began to retreat westwards. The areas abandoned by the <a href="/wiki/Central_Powers.html" title="Central Powers">Central Powers</a> became a field of conflict among local governments created by Germany, other local governments that independently sprang up after the German withdrawal, and the Bolsheviks, who hoped to incorporate those areas into Soviet Russia. Many of those groups were fragmented, merged, divided, formed short alliances with others, and almost constantly fought. Almost all of Eastern Europe was in chaos.</p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/November_18.html" title="November 18">November 18</a>, <a href="/wiki/1918.html" title="1918">1918</a>, Vladimir Lenin issued orders to the <a href="/wiki/Western_Army_%28Russia%29.html" title="Western Army (Russia)">Western Army</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Red_Army.html" title="Red Army">Red Army</a> to begin <a href="/wiki/Russian_westward_offensive_of_1918-1919.html" title="Russian westward offensive of 1918-1919">movement westwards</a> that would follow the withdrawing German troops of Oberkommando Ostfront (<a href="/wiki/Ober-Ost.html" title="Ober-Ost">Ober-Ost</a>). The basic aim of the operation was to drive through eastern and central Europe, institute Soviet governments in the newly independent countries of that region and support communist revolutions in Germany and Austria-Hungary. At the start of 1919, fighting broke out almost by accident and without any orders from the respective governments, when self-organized Polish military units in <a href="/wiki/Vilnius.html" title="Vilnius">Vilnius</a> (Wilno) clashed with Bolshevik forces of <a href="/wiki/Litbel.html" title="Litbel">Litbel</a>, each trying to secure the territories for its own incipient government. Eventually the more organized Soviet forces quelled most of the resistance and drove the remaining Polish forces west. On 5 January 1919, the Red Army entered <a href="/wiki/Minsk.html" title="Minsk">Minsk</a> almost unopposed, thus putting an end to the short-lived <a href="/wiki/Belarusian_People%27s_Republic.html" title="Belarusian People's Republic">Belarusian People's Republic</a>. At the same time, more and more self-defense units, mostly led by Poles, sprang up across western Belarus and Lithuania (<a  class="new" title="Lithuanian and Belarusian Self-Defence">Lithuanian and Belarusian Self-Defence</a>)<sup id="_ref-Samoobrona_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[23]</a></sup>. A series of local skirmishes ensued between them and pro-Bolshevik groups operating in the area. The newly organized <a href="/wiki/Polish_Army.html" title="Polish Army">Polish Army</a> began sending the first of their units east to assist the self-defense forces, while the Russians sent their own units west. Open conflict seemed inevitable.</p>
<p>In the spring of 1919, Soviet conscription produced a Red Army of 2,300,000. However, few of these were sent west that year, as the majority of Red Army forces were engaged against the Russian <a href="/wiki/White_movement.html" title="White movement">White movement</a>. In September 1919, the Polish army had 540,000 men under arms, 230,000 of these on the Soviet <a href="/wiki/Front_%28military%29.html" title="Front (military)">front</a>.</p>
<p>At the same time the Polish forces had been advancing eastwards. By <a href="/wiki/February_14.html" title="February 14">14 February</a>, the Poles had secured positions along the line of <a href="/wiki/Kobryn.html" title="Kobryn">Kobryn</a>, <a href="/wiki/Pruzhany.html" title="Pruzhany">Pruzhany</a>, rivers <a  class="new" title="Zalewianka">Zalewianka</a> and <a href="/wiki/Neman_River.html" title="Neman River">Neman</a>. Around <a href="/wiki/February_14.html" title="February 14">14 February</a>, the first organised Polish units made contact with the advance units of the Red Army, and a border frontline slowly began to form from Lithuania, through Belarus to Ukraine.</p>

Central and Eastern Europe in December 1919</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>In early March 1919, Polish units started an offensive, crossing the <a href="/wiki/Neman_River.html" title="Neman River">Neman River</a>, taking <a href="/wiki/Pinsk.html" title="Pinsk">Pinsk</a> and reaching the outskirts of <a href="/wiki/Lida.html" title="Lida">Lida</a>. Both the Russian and Polish advances began around the same time in April, resulting in increasing numbers of troops being brought into the area. That month the Bolsheviks captured <a href="/wiki/Grodno.html" title="Grodno">Grodno</a> and <a href="/wiki/Vilnius.html" title="Vilnius">Vilnius</a>, but were pushed out by a Polish counteroffensive. The newly-formed Polish Army had proven to be a far more difficult opponent than the Russians had assumed. Unable to accomplish their objectives and facing strengthening offensives from the White forces, the Red Army withdrew from their positions and reorganized. Soon the Polish-Soviet War would begin in earnest.</p>
<p>Polish forces recaptured Vilnius on <a href="/wiki/April_19.html" title="April 19">April 19</a>, driving the <a href="/wiki/Litbel.html" title="Litbel">Litbel</a> government from their proclaimed capital<sup id="_ref-Cienciala_9" class="reference"><a  title="">[4]</a></sup>, and steadily continued advancing east. On 28 August, Polish forces for the first time used <a href="/wiki/Tank.html" title="Tank">tanks</a> and after heavy fighting captured the town of <a href="/wiki/Babruysk.html" title="Babruysk">Babruysk</a> near the <a href="/wiki/Berezina_River.html" title="Berezina River">Berezina River</a>.

<p>Until early 1920, the Polish offensive was quite successful.

<p>At the same time, the Russian civil war raged on.

As such, by his refusal to join the attack on Lenin's struggling government, ignoring the strong pressure from the <a href="/wiki/Entente.html" title="Entente">Entente</a>, Piłsudski had likely saved the Bolshevik government in Summer–Fall 1919.

<p>In 1919, several attempts at peace negotiations had been made by various Polish-Russian factions, but to no avail. In the meantime, Polish-Lithuanian relations worsened as Polish politicians found it hard to accept the Lithuanians' demand for complete independence and their territorial demands, especially on ceding the city of <a href="/wiki/Vilnius.html" title="Vilnius">Vilnius</a> (Wilno), Lithuania's historical capital which had nonetheless a Polish ethnic majority. Polish negotiators made progress in negotiations with the <a href="/wiki/Latvia.html" title="Latvia">Latvian</a> Provisional Government, and in early 1920 Polish and Latvian forces were conducting some joint operations against Russia.</p>
<p>The main Polish diplomatic success was the signing of an agreement with the exiled Ukrainian nationalist leader <a href="/wiki/Symon_Petlura.html" title="Symon Petlura">Symon Petlura</a> who formally represented the defunct <a href="/wiki/Ukrainian_People%27s_Republic.html" title="Ukrainian People's Republic">Ukrainian People's Republic</a> by then de-facto defeated by Bolsheviks. Petlura, along with some Ukrainian forces that fled with him to Poland, found <a href="/wiki/Political_asylum.html" title="Political asylum">asylum</a> there. By concluding an agreement with Piłsudski, Petlura accepted the Polish territorial gains in Western Ukraine and the future Polish-Ukrainian border along the <a href="/wiki/Zbruch_River.html" title="Zbruch River">Zbruch River</a>. In exchange, he was promised Polish military assistance in reinstalling his government in Kiev, where he would again assume the authority of the already twice-unsuccessful Ukrainian People's Republic.<sup id="_ref-Cienciala_10" class="reference"><a  title="">[4]</a></sup> Following the formal restoration of Ukrainian independence, the Ukrainian republic was then supposed to join the Polish-led "<a href="/wiki/Mi%C4%99dzymorze.html" title="Międzymorze">Międzymorze</a>" federation of East-Central European states, as Piłsudski wanted Ukraine to be a buffer between Poland and Russia.<sup id="_ref-Suny_1" class="reference"><a  title="">[7]</a></sup> rather than seeing Ukraine again dominated by Russia right at the Polish border.<sup id="_ref-PolSize_1" class="reference"><a  title="">[19]</a></sup> For Piłsudski, this alliance was an important step towards Międzymorze, at the same time securing part of the Polish eastward border and laying a foundation for a Ukrainian buffer state between Poland and Russia.

<h4>Opposing forces</h4>
<p>By early 1920, the Soviet forces had been very successful against the <a href="/wiki/White_movement.html" title="White movement">White armies</a>, defeating <a href="/wiki/Denikin.html" title="Denikin">Denikin</a>, and signed peace treaties with Latvia and Estonia. The Polish front became the most important war theater and the majority of Soviet resources and forces were diverted to it. In January 1920, the Red Army began concentrating a 700,000-strong force near the <a href="/wiki/Berezina_River.html" title="Berezina River">Berezina River</a> and on Belarus. In the course of 1920, almost 800,000 Red Army personnel were sent to fight in the Polish war, of whom 402,000 went to the Western front and 355,000 to the armies of the South-West front in <a href="/wiki/Galicia_%28Central_Europe%29.html" title="Galicia (Central Europe)">Galicia</a>. The Soviets had at their disposal many military depots left by German armies withdrawing from eastern Europe in 1918-19, and modern French armaments captured in great numbers from the White Russians and the Allied expeditionary forces in the Russian Civil War. With the new forces, the Soviet High Command planned a new offensive in late April/May.</p>
<p>Bolshevik commanders in the Red Army's coming offensive would include <a href="/wiki/Mikhail_Tukhachevsky.html" title="Mikhail Tukhachevsky">Mikhail Tukhachevsky</a> (new commander of the Western Front), <a href="/wiki/Leon_Trotsky.html" title="Leon Trotsky">Leon Trotsky</a>, the future Soviet ruler <a href="/wiki/Joseph_Stalin.html" title="Joseph Stalin">Joseph Stalin</a>, and the future founder of the <a href="/wiki/Cheka.html" title="Cheka">Cheka</a> secret police, <a href="/wiki/Felix_Edmundovich_Dzerzhinsky.html" title="Felix Edmundovich Dzerzhinsky">Felix Edmundovich Dzerzhinsky</a>.</p>
<p>The Polish Army was made up of soldiers who had formerly served in the various partitioning empires, supported by inexperienced volunteers (including 20,000 Americans) and recruits. <a href="/wiki/Boris_Savinkov.html" title="Boris Savinkov">Boris Savinkov</a> was at the head of an army of 20,000 to 30,000 largely Russian POWs, and accompanied by <a href="/wiki/Dmitry_Merezhkovsky.html" title="Dmitry Merezhkovsky">Dmitry Merezhkovsky</a> and <a href="/wiki/Zinaida_Gippius.html" title="Zinaida Gippius">Zinaida Gippius</a> <a href="/wiki/Logistics.html" title="Logistics">Logistics</a> were very bad, relying on whatever equipment was left over from World War I and could be captured. The Polish Army employed guns made in five countries, and <a href="/wiki/Rifle.html" title="Rifle">rifles</a> manufactured in six, each using different ammunition. The Polish forces grew from approximately 100,000 in 1918 to over 500,000 in early 1920. On <a href="/wiki/August_20.html" title="August 20">20 August</a> <a href="/wiki/1920.html" title="1920">1920</a>, the Polish army had reached the total strength of 737,000, so there was rough numerical parity between the two armies - 950,000 on the Soviet side. Although Soviet Russia had reserves totaling 4 million soldiers, due to shortage of arms they were not at the front as Russia could only produce 100,000 rifles per month.</p>
<p>From March 1919 Polish intelligence was aware that the Soviets had prepared for a new offensive and the Polish High Command decided to launch their own offensive before their opponents.<sup id="_ref-Cienciala_11" class="reference"><a  title="">[4]</a></sup> The plan for <a href="/wiki/Operation_Kiev.html" title="Operation Kiev">Operation Kiev</a> was to beat the Red Army on Poland's southern flank and install a Polish-friendly Petlura government in Ukraine.<sup id="_ref-Cienciala_12" class="reference"><a  title="">[4]</a></sup></p>

<p>Until April, the Polish forces had been slowly but steadily advancing eastward.

By March, Polish forces had driven a wedge between Soviet forces to the north (Byelorussia) and south (Ukraine).</p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/April_24.html" title="April 24">April 24</a>, Poland began its main offensive, <a href="/wiki/Operation_Kiev.html" title="Operation Kiev">Operation Kiev</a>, whose stated goal was the creation of independent Ukraine<sup id="_ref-Cienciala_13" class="reference"><a  title="">[4]</a></sup> that would become part of Piłsudski's project of a "<a href="/wiki/Mi%C4%99dzymorze.html" title="Międzymorze">Międzymorze</a>" Federation. Poland was assisted by the small force of the exiled <a href="/wiki/Symon_Petlura.html" title="Symon Petlura">Symon Petlura</a>, nominally representing the <a href="/wiki/Ukrainian_People%27s_Republic.html" title="Ukrainian People's Republic">Ukrainian People's Republic</a>.

<p>The Polish 3rd Army easily won border clashes with the Red Army in Ukraine.

Polish forces in the area, preparing for an offensive towards <a  class="new" title="Žlobin">Žlobin</a>, managed to push the Soviets back, but were unable to start their own planned offensive. In the north, Polish forces had fared much worse. The Polish 1st Army was defeated and forced to retreat, pursued by the Russian 15th Army which recaptured territories between the <a href="/wiki/Western_Dvina.html" title="Western Dvina">Western Dvina</a> and <a href="/wiki/Berezina.html" title="Berezina">Berezina</a> rivers.

At the end of May, the front had stabilised near the small river <a  class="new" title="Auta">Auta</a>, and Soviet forces began preparing for the next push.</p>

<p>Due to insufficient forces, Poland's 200-mile-long front was manned by a thin line of 120,000 troops backed by some 460 artillery pieces with no strategic reserves.

<p>Against the Polish line the Red Army gathered their Northwest Front led by the young General <a href="/wiki/Mikhail_Tukhachevski.html" title="Mikhail Tukhachevski">Mikhail Tukhachevski</a>. Their numbers exceeded 108,000 infantry and 11,000 cavalry, supported by 722 artillery pieces and 2,913 machine guns. The Russians at some crucial places outnumbered the Poles four-to-one.</p>
<p>Tukhachevski launched his offensive <a href="/wiki/July_4.html" title="July 4">July 4</a>, along the axis <a href="/wiki/Smolensk.html" title="Smolensk">Smolensk</a>-<a href="/wiki/Brest-Litovsk.html" title="Brest-Litovsk">Brest-Litovsk</a>, crossing the Auta and <a href="/wiki/Berezina.html" title="Berezina">Berezina</a>. The northern 3rd Cavalry Corps of <a href="/wiki/Gayk_Bzhishkyan.html" title="Gayk Bzhishkyan">Gayk Bzhishkyan</a> (Gay Dmitrievich Gay, Gaj-Chan) was to envelope Polish forces from the north, moving near the Lithuanian and Prussian border (both of these belonging to nations hostile to Poland). 4th, 15th and 3rd Armies were to push decisively west, supported from the south by the 16th Army and Grupa Mozyrska. For three days the outcome of the battle hung in the balance, but the Russians' numerical superiority finally became apparent. Due to the stubborn defense by Polish units, Tukhachevsky's plan to break through the front and push the defenders southwest into the <a href="/wiki/Pinsk_Marshes.html" title="Pinsk Marshes">Pinsk Marshes</a> failed, but from <a href="/wiki/July_7.html" title="July 7">July 7</a>, the Polish forces were in full retreat along the entire front.</p>
<p>Polish resistance was offered again on a line of "German trenches," a heavily fortified line of World War I field fortifications that presented a unique opportunity to stem the Russian offensive. Once again, however, the Polish troops were insufficient in number. Soviet forces selected a weakly defended part of the front and broke through. Gej-Chan forces, supported by Lithuanian forces, captured Wilno on <a href="/wiki/July_14.html" title="July 14">14 July</a>, forcing the Poles to retreat again. In the south, in <a href="/wiki/Galicia_%28Central_Europe%29.html" title="Galicia (Central Europe)">Galicia</a>, General <a href="/wiki/Semyon_Budyonny.html" title="Semyon Budyonny">Semyon Budyonny</a>'s cavalry advanced far into the Polish rear, capturing <a  class="new" title="Brodno">Brodno</a> and approaching <a href="/wiki/Lw%C3%B3w.html" title="Lwów">Lwów</a> and <a href="/wiki/Zamo%C5%9B%C4%87.html" title="Zamość">Zamość</a>.

The <a href="/wiki/Brest-Litovsk_fortress.html" title="Brest-Litovsk fortress">Brest-Litovsk fortress</a> which was to be the headquarters of the planned Polish counteroffensive fell to the 16th Army in the first attack.

The way to the Polish capital lay open. Polish Galicia's Lviv (Lwów) was soon <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Lw%C3%B3w_%281920%29.html" title="Battle of Lwów (1920)">besieged</a>, and five Russian armies were approaching Warsaw.

<p>Polish forces in Galicia near Lviv launched a successful counteroffensive to slow the Soviets down.

<p>Western public opinion was strongly pro-Soviet. Britain's Prime Minister, <a href="/wiki/David_Lloyd_George.html" title="David Lloyd George">David Lloyd George</a>, who wanted to negotiate a favourable trade agreement with the Bolsheviks<sup id="_ref-Cienciala_17" class="reference"><a  title="">[4]</a></sup> pressed Poland to make peace on Soviet terms and refused any assistance to Poland which would alienate the Whites in the Russian Civil War. In July 1920, Britain announced it would send huge quantities of World War One surplus military supplies to Poland, but a threatened general strike by the <a href="/wiki/Trades_Union_Congress.html" title="Trades Union Congress">Trades Union Congress</a>, who objected to British support of "White Poland", ensured that none of the weapons destined for Poland went any further than British ports. David Lloyd George had never been enthusiastic about supporting the Poles, and had been pressured by his more right-wing Cabinet members such as <a href="/wiki/Lord_Curzon.html" title="Lord Curzon">Lord Curzon</a> and <a href="/wiki/Winston_Churchill.html" title="Winston Churchill">Winston Churchill</a> into offering the supplies. On the 11th of July, 1920, the government of Great Britain issued a <i>de facto</i> ultimatum to the Soviets<sup title="The text in the vicinity of this tag needs citation." class="noprint">[<a  title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><i>citation&#160;needed</i></a>]</sup>. The Soviets were ordered to stop hostilities against Poland and the Russian Army (the White Army in Southern Russia lead by Baron Wrangel), and to accept what later was called the "<a href="/wiki/Curzon_line.html" title="Curzon line">Curzon line</a>" as a temporary border with Poland, until a permanent border could be established in negotiations. In case of Soviet refusal, the British threatened to assist Poland with all the means available, which, in reality, were limited by the internal political situation in the United Kingdom. On the 17th of July, the Bolsheviks refused and made a counter-offer to negotiate a peace treaty directly with Poland. The British responded by a threat to cut off the on-going trade negotiations if the Soviets conducted further offensives against Poland. These threats were ignored.</p>
<p>The threatened general strike was for Lloyd George a convenient excuse for backing out of his commitments. On <a href="/wiki/August_6.html" title="August 6">August 6</a>, 1920, the British <a href="/wiki/Labour_Party_%28UK%29.html" title="Labour Party (UK)">Labour Party</a> published a pamphlet stating that British workers would never take part in the war as Poland's allies, and labour unions blocked supplies to the British expeditionary force assisting Russian Whites in <a href="/wiki/Arkhangelsk.html" title="Arkhangelsk">Arkhangelsk</a>. French Socialists, in their newspaper <i><a href="/wiki/L%27Humanit%C3%A9.html" title="L'Humanité">L'Humanité</a></i>, declared: "Not a man, not a <a href="/wiki/Sou.html" title="Sou">sou</a>, not a shell for reactionary and capitalist Poland. Long live the Russian Revolution! Long live the Workmen's International!" Poland suffered setbacks due to sabotage and delays in deliveries of war supplies, when workers in Austria, Czechoslovakia and Germany refused to transit such materials to Poland.<sup id="_ref-Cienciala_18" class="reference"><a  title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Lithuania.html" title="Lithuania">Lithuania</a>'s stance was mostly anti-Polish and the country eventually joined the Soviet side in the war against Poland in July 1919. Lithuania's decision was dictated by a desire to incorporate the city of <a href="/wiki/Wilno.html" title="Wilno">Wilno</a> (in Lithuanian, Vilnius) and the nearby areas into Lithuania and to a smaller extent by Soviet diplomatic pressure backed by the threat of the Red Army stationed on Lithuania's borders.</p>
<p>Polish allies were few. <a href="/wiki/France.html" title="France">France</a>, continuing her policy of countering Bolshevism, now that the Whites in Russia proper had been almost completely defeated, sent in 1919 a 400-strong <a href="/wiki/French_Military_Mission_to_Poland.html" title="French Military Mission to Poland">small advisory group to Poland's aid</a>. This group was comprised mostly of French officers, although it also included <a href="/wiki/British_Military_Mission_to_Poland.html" title="British Military Mission to Poland">a few British advisers</a> led by Lieutenant General Sir <a href="/wiki/Adrian_Carton_De_Wiart.html" title="Adrian Carton De Wiart">Adrian Carton De Wiart</a>. The French effort was vital to improving the organization and logistics of the Polish Army, which until 1919 had used diverse manuals, organizational structures and equipment, mostly drawn from the armies of Poland's former partitioners. The French officers included a future President of France, <a href="/wiki/Charles_de_Gaulle.html" title="Charles de Gaulle">Charles de Gaulle</a>, who during that war won Poland's highest military decoration, the <a href="/wiki/Virtuti_Militari.html" title="Virtuti Militari">Virtuti Militari</a>. In addition to the Allied advisors, France also facilitated in 1919 the transit to Poland from France of the "<a href="/wiki/Blue_Army.html" title="Blue Army">Blue Army</a>": a force of troops, mostly of Polish origin plus some international volunteers, formerly under French command in World War I. The army was commanded by the Polish general, <a href="/wiki/J%C3%B3zef_Haller.html" title="Józef Haller">Józef Haller</a>. <a href="/wiki/Hungary.html" title="Hungary">Hungary</a> offered to send a 30,000 cavalry corps to Poland's aid, but the Czechoslovakian government refused to allow them through; some trains with weapon supplies from Hungary did however arrive in Poland.</p>
<p>In mid-1920, the Allied Mission was expanded by some new advisers (the <a href="/wiki/Interallied_Mission_to_Poland.html" title="Interallied Mission to Poland">Interallied Mission to Poland</a>). They included the French diplomat, <a href="/wiki/Jean_Jules_Jusserand.html" title="Jean Jules Jusserand">Jean Jules Jusserand</a>; <a href="/wiki/Maxime_Weygand.html" title="Maxime Weygand">Maxime Weygand</a>, chief of staff to Marshal <a href="/wiki/Ferdinand_Foch.html" title="Ferdinand Foch">Ferdinand Foch</a>, Supreme Commander of the victorious Entente; and the British diplomat, Lord <a href="/wiki/Edgar_Vincent_D%27Abernon.html" title="Edgar Vincent D'Abernon">Edgar Vincent D'Abernon</a>. The newest members of the mission achieved little; indeed, the crucial Battle of Warsaw was fought and won by the Poles before the mission could return and make its report. Subsequently, for many years, the <a href="/wiki/Mythology.html" title="Mythology">myth</a> persisted that it was the timely arrival of Allied forces that had saved Poland, a myth in which Weygand occupied the central role.<sup id="_ref-Cienciala_19" class="reference"><a  title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>Eventually, on the 21st of February, 1921, France and Poland entered into <a href="/wiki/Franco-Polish_Military_Alliance.html" title="Franco-Polish Military Alliance">a formal military alliance</a>, which became an important factor during the subsequent Soviet-Polish negotiations.</p>

<p>On <a href="/wiki/August_10.html" title="August 10">August 10</a>, <a href="/wiki/1920.html" title="1920">1920</a>, Russian <a href="/wiki/Cossack.html" title="Cossack">Cossack</a> units under the command of <a href="/wiki/Gay_Dimitrievich_Gay.html" title="Gay Dimitrievich Gay">Gay Dimitrievich Gay</a> crossed the <a href="/wiki/Vistula.html" title="Vistula">Vistula</a> river, planning to take Warsaw from the west while the main attack came from the east. On <a href="/wiki/August_13.html" title="August 13">August 13</a>, an initial Russian attack was repulsed. The Polish 1st Army resisted a direct <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Warsaw_%281920%29.html" title="Battle of Warsaw (1920)">assault on Warsaw</a> as well as stopping the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Radzymin.html" title="Battle of Radzymin">assault at Radzymin</a>.</p>
<p>The Soviet <a href="/wiki/Commander-in-chief.html" title="Commander-in-chief">commander-in-chief</a>, <a href="/wiki/Mikhail_Tukhachevsky.html" title="Mikhail Tukhachevsky">Mikhail Tukhachevsky</a>, feeling certain that all was going according to his plan, was actually falling into the trap set by Piłsudski. The Russian advance across the Vistula River in the north was advancing into an operational vacuum, as there were no sizable Polish forces in the area. On the other hand, south of Warsaw, where the fate of the war was about to be decided, Tukhachevski had left only token forces to guard the vital link between the Russian northwest and southwest fronts. Another factor that influenced the outcome of the war was the effective neutralization of Budionny's 1st Cavalry Army, much feared by Piłsudski and other Polish commanders, in the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Lw%C3%B3w_%281920%29.html" title="Battle of Lwów (1920)">battles around Lwów</a>. The Soviet High Command, at Tukhachevski's insistence, had ordered the 1st Cavalry Army to march north toward Warsaw and <a href="/wiki/Lublin.html" title="Lublin">Lublin</a>, but Budionny disobeyed the order due to a grudge between Tukhachevski and <a href="/wiki/Aleksandr_Yegorov.html" title="Aleksandr Yegorov">Yegorov</a>, commander of the southwest front. Additionally, the political games of <a href="/wiki/Joseph_Stalin.html" title="Joseph Stalin">Joseph Stalin</a>, chief political <a href="/wiki/Commissar.html" title="Commissar">commissar</a> of the Southwest Front, decisively influenced the disobedience of Yegorov and Budionny<sup id="_ref-Adam_Bruno_Ulam_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[35]</a></sup>. Stalin, seeking a personal triumph, was focused on capturing <a href="/wiki/Lw%C3%B3w.html" title="Lwów">Lwów</a>—far to the southeast of Warsaw—besieged by Bolshevik forces but still resisting their assaults.</p>
<p>The Polish 5th Army under General <a href="/wiki/W%C5%82adys%C5%82aw_Sikorski.html" title="Władysław Sikorski">Władysław Sikorski</a> counterattacked <a href="/wiki/August_14.html" title="August 14">August 14</a> from the area of the <a href="/wiki/Modlin_fortress.html" title="Modlin fortress">Modlin fortress</a>, crossing the <a href="/wiki/Wkra.html" title="Wkra">Wkra</a> River. It faced the combined forces of the numerically and materially superior Soviet 3rd and 15th Armies. In one day the Soviet advance toward Warsaw and Modlin had been halted and soon turned into retreat. Sikorski's 5th Army pushed the exhausted Soviet formations away from Warsaw in a lightning operation. Polish forces advanced at a speed of thirty kilometers a day, soon destroying any Soviet hopes for completing their enveloping maneuver in the north. By <a href="/wiki/August_16.html" title="August 16">August 16</a>, the Polish counteroffensive had been fully joined by Marshal Piłsudski's "Reserve Army." Precisely executing his plan, the Polish force, advancing from the south, found a huge gap between the Russian fronts and exploited the weakness of the Soviet "Mozyr Group" that was supposed to protect the weak link between the Soviet fronts. The Poles continued their northward offensive with two armies following and destroying the surprised enemy. They reached the rear of Tukhachevski's forces, the majority of which were encircled by <a href="/wiki/August_18.html" title="August 18">August 18</a>. Only that same day did Tukhachevski, at his <a href="/wiki/Minsk.html" title="Minsk">Minsk</a> headquarters 300 miles east of Warsaw, become fully aware of the proportions of the Soviet defeat and ordered the remnants of his forces to retreat and regroup. He hoped to straighten his front line, halt the Polish attack, and regain the initiative, but the orders either arrived too late or failed to arrive at all.</p>
<p>The Soviet armies in the center of the front fell into chaos. Tukhachevski ordered a general retreat toward the <a href="/wiki/Bug_River.html" title="Bug River">Bug River</a>, but by then he had lost contact with most of his forces near Warsaw, and all the Bolshevik plans had been thrown into disarray by communication failures.</p>
<p>The Bolshevik armies retreated in a disorganised fashion, entire divisions panicking and disintegrating. The Red Army's defeat was so great and so unexpected that, at the instigation of Piłsudski's detractors, the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Warsaw_%281920%29.html" title="Battle of Warsaw (1920)">Battle of Warsaw</a> is often referred to in Poland as the "<a href="/wiki/Miracle_at_the_Vistula.html" title="Miracle at the Vistula">Miracle at the Vistula</a>." Current investigation in Poland concluded that the "Miracle at the Vistula" was caused by a big net of Polish spies within the Red Army. Piłsudski knew about all the moves by the Red Army while the Soviets were left in the dark.</p>

<p>The Bolsheviks sued for peace soon after the Battle of Warsaw, and the Poles, exhausted and constantly pressured by the Western governments and <a href="/wiki/League_of_Nations.html" title="League of Nations">League of Nations</a>, with the Polish army now controlling the majority of the disputed territories, were willing to negotiate. In September in Riga, the Soviets made two offers: on September 21st and 28th. The Polish delegation made a counteroffer on the 2nd of October. On the 5th, the Soviets offered amendments to the Polish offer. Poland accepted. The <a href="/wiki/Armistice.html" title="Armistice">armistice</a> between Poland on one side and Soviet Ukraine and Soviet Russia on the other was signed on the 12th and went into effect on the 18th of October. Long negotiations of the peace treaty ensued.</p>

<p>According to the British historian <a href="/wiki/A.J.P._Taylor.html" title="A.J.P. Taylor">A.J.P. Taylor</a>, the Polish-Bolshevik War "largely determined the course of European history for the next twenty years or more. […] Unavowedly and almost unconsciously, Soviet leaders abandoned the cause of international revolution." It would be twenty years before the Bolsheviks would send their armies abroad to 'make revolution'<sup id="_ref-Suny_5" class="reference"><a  title="">[7]</a></sup>. The Bolsheviks' defeat in the war prevented Poland from becoming another Soviet republic and possibly spared Germany, Czechoslovakia and other nearby states from a similar fate<sup id="_ref-Gella_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[36]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Much of what Piłsudski had won during the 1920 war was lost in the ensuing peace negotiations. Due to their disastrous military defeat, the Bolsheviks offered the Polish peace delegation substantial territorial concessions in the contested borderland areas. However, Polish resources were exhausted, Polish public opinion divided, the Polish government was pressured by the <a href="/wiki/League_of_Nations.html" title="League of Nations">League of Nations</a>, and most vitally, the negotiations were controlled by Dmowski's National Democrats: Piłsudski might have controlled the military, but parliament (<a href="/wiki/Sejm.html" title="Sejm">Sejm</a>) was controlled by Dmowski, and the peace negotiations fell into the political realm. National Democrats, like <a href="/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_Grabski.html" title="Stanisław Grabski">Stanisław Grabski</a>, who earlier resigned his post to protest the Polish–Ukrainian alliance<sup id="_ref-Snyder_1" class="reference"><a  title="">[27]</a></sup> and now wielded much influence over the Polish negotiators, cared little for <a href="/wiki/Mi%C4%99dzymorze.html" title="Międzymorze">Międzymorze</a> or the Ukrainians, and wanted only the territory which they viewed as 'ethnically or historically Polish', and possible to <a href="/wiki/Polonize.html" title="Polonize">polonize</a><sup id="_ref-BFG_1" class="reference"><a  title="">[17]</a></sup>. To many observers it seemed as though the Polish side was conducting the Riga talks as if Poland had not won but lost the war; <a href="/wiki/Adolf_Joffe.html" title="Adolf Joffe">Adolf Joffe</a>, the Russian chief negotiator, was pleased to gain territories for Moscow that were controlled by Polish forces.

<p>The <a href="/wiki/Polish-Lithuanian_War.html" title="Polish-Lithuanian War">Polish military successes in the autumn of 1920</a> allowed Poland to capture the <a href="/wiki/Vilnius_region.html" title="Vilnius region">Wilno (Vilnius) region</a>, where a Polish-dominated Governance Committee of <a href="/wiki/Central_Lithuania.html" title="Central Lithuania">Central Lithuania</a> (<i>Komisja Rządząca Litwy Środkowej</i>) was formed.

<p>Military strategy in the Polish–Soviet War influenced <a href="/wiki/Charles_de_Gaulle.html" title="Charles de Gaulle">Charles de Gaulle</a>, then an instructor with the Polish Army who fought in several of the battles. He and <a href="/wiki/W%C5%82adys%C5%82aw_Sikorski.html" title="Władysław Sikorski">Władysław Sikorski</a> were the only military officers who, based on their experiences of this war, correctly predicted how the next one would be fought. Although they failed in the <a href="/wiki/Interbellum.html" title="Interbellum">interbellum</a> to convince their respective militaries to heed those lessons, early in <a href="/wiki/World_War_II.html" title="World War II">World War II</a> they rose to command of their armed forces in exile. The Polish-Soviet War also influenced Polish military doctrine, which for the next 20 years would place emphasis on the mobility of elite cavalry units.</p>
<p>Among the technical advances associated with the Polish-Soviet War was one that would, two decades later, <a href="/wiki/Bomba_%28cryptography%29.html" title="Bomba (cryptography)">affect the course of World War II</a>. <a href="/wiki/Marshal_of_Poland.html" title="Marshal of Poland">Poland's Marshal</a> Piłsudski and his staff enjoyed a vast advantage from their <a href="/wiki/Military_intelligence.html" title="Military intelligence">military intelligence</a> <a href="/wiki/Cryptanalysis.html" title="Cryptanalysis">decrypting</a> ("breaking") Red Army radio messages.

The Polish <a href="/wiki/Cryptologist.html" title="Cryptologist">cryptologists</a> and commanders were thus regularly able to look over the shoulders of the Soviet commanders, including <a href="/wiki/Mikhail_Tukhachevski.html" title="Mikhail Tukhachevski">Mikhail Tukhachevski</a>, and their superior, <a href="/wiki/Leon_Trotsky.html" title="Leon Trotsky">Leon Trotsky</a>.<sup id="_ref-.C5.9Acie.C5.BCy.C5.84ski_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[39]</a></sup> <sup id="_ref-Wro.C5.84ski_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[40]</a></sup> <sup id="_ref-Bury_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[41]</a></sup></p>

<p>Both sides raised charges of other violations of the laws of war mostly to sway the governments and public opinion in <a href="/wiki/Entente.html" title="Entente">Entente</a> countries whose help in the war was crucial for Poland.</p>
<p>The Polish side claimed that during the Soviet retreat from <a href="/wiki/Berdychiv.html" title="Berdychiv">Berdychiv</a>, <a href="/wiki/Kiev.html" title="Kiev">Kiev</a> and <a href="/wiki/Zhytomyr.html" title="Zhytomyr">Zhytomyr</a> mass hostage-taking of civilians occurred, with hostages forced to go with the Reds all the way to the rear of the front.<sup id="_ref-Melt_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[46]</a></sup> Similar claims were made that returning to Berdychiv the Bolsheviks threw out the sick and wounded from the hospital "disregarding the lives and honor of the medical personnel"<sup id="_ref-Melt_1" class="reference"><a  title="">[46]</a></sup> and that in general the Soviet advance into Ukraine was characterized by mass killing of civilians and the burning of entire villages, especially by <a href="/wiki/Budyonny.html" title="Budyonny">Budyonny</a>'s cossacks, designed to instill a sense of fear in the Ukrainian population. Behind Polish lines, the Soviet forces destroyed railroads, hanged suspected enemies on the spot, and cut telegraph wires.<sup id="_ref-WattQuote_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[47]</a></sup> Ultimately, in the pacification of Ukraine that began during the Soviet counteroffensive in 1920 and which would not end until 1922, the Soviets would take 10,000s of Ukrainian lives.<sup id="_ref-BlackBook_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[48]</a></sup></p>
<p>Some first hand accounts from participants may support the claim that such behavior was found on both sides.

The bandit and the murderer and his comrades - subordinates are just like that. They know no shame and are similar to barbarians... I witnessed throwing the cut-off heads of Bolsheviks under his feet... I drank with him all night long and in the morning he with his group and me with my regiment went to the fighting. The massacre of Bolsheviks was horrific".<sup id="_ref-Melt_2" class="reference"><a  title="">[46]</a></sup> There is evidence that the bands of Cossack "Colonel" <a href="/wiki/Vadim_Yakovlev.html" title="Vadim Yakovlev">Vadim Yakovlev</a> were similarly cruel.

<li id="_note-Derh"><b><a  title="">^</a></b> "<i>No less influential and popular than the concept of [national democrats] was the "federalist" program of Josef Pilsudski, a socialist and the most authoritative Polish politicial of the 20th century. The essence of that program was that after the ovethrowal of tsardom and the disintegration of the Russian empire, the large, strong and mighty Poland was to be created in Eastern Europe. It was the reincarnation of the Rzeczpospolita on "federative" principles. It was to include the Polish, Lithuanian, Belarusian and Ukrainian lands. The leadin role, of course, was to be given to the Polish ethnic, political, economic and cultural element. Despite the program failed to address the question on what to do if the people would not want to join into the Rzeczpospolita, the socialists declared the voluntaraly entry into the future state. So, two influential and popular Polish political doctrines in regard to Ukraine, the "incorporative" and the "federalist", even before the creation of the Polish state were based on the disregard of the rights of the Ukrainian people for self-determination and on the claims on the Ukrainian lands. Other concept did not play a significant role"</i><br />

<li id="_note-ZerkDestiny">^ <a  title=""><sup><i><b>a</b></i></sup></a>&#160;<a  title=""><sup><i><b>b</b></i></sup></a> "In September 1919 the armies of the Ukrainian Directory in Podolia found themselves in the "death triangle". They were squeezed between the Red Russians of Lenin and Trotsky in the north-east, White Russians of Denikin in south-east and the Poles in the West. Death were looking into their eyes. And not only to the people but to the nascent Ukrainian state. Therefore, the chief ataman Petlura had no choice but to accept the union offered by Piłsudski, or, as an alternative, to capitulate to the Bolsheviks, as Volodymyr Vinnychenko or Mykhailo Hrushevsky did at the time or in a year or two. The decision was very hurtful. The Polish Szlachta was a historic enemy of the Ukrainian people. A fresh wound was bleeding, the West Ukrainian People's Republic, as the Pilsudchiks were suppressing the East Galicians at that very moment. However, Petlura agreed to peace and the union, accepting the Ukrainian-Polish border, the future Soviet-Polish one. It's also noteworthy that Piłsudski also obtained less territories than offered to him by Lenin, and, in addition, the war with immense Russia. The Dnieper Ukrainians then were abandoning their brothers, the Galicia Ukrainians, to their fate. However, Petlura wanted to use his last chance to preserve the statehood - in the union with the Poles. Attempted, however, without luck."<br />

<li id="_note-Polonica_quote2"><b><a  title="">^</a></b> "The Bolsheviks had flooded the Ukraine, forcing Ataman Semyon Petlura (a Ukrainian bookkeeper turned national hero) to sign an alliance with Pilsudski, securing Lwow for Poland and possibly Pilsudski's envisioned federation. On 7 May the Polish army liberated Kiev in the intention of giving it to Petlura in a Polish-Ukrainian-Federation. On 5 June the Bolsheviks were back in Kiev. The major problem which prevented Pilsudski from securing Kiev and creating his federation was the unwillingness of the inhabitants of Ukraine, to rush to the aid of Petlura and his Ukrainian nationalist forces. Most Ukrainians had no idea what Bolshevism was and were easily manipulated by the Russians. Besides, many of the Ukrainian peasants were very simple people who still had memories of serfdom, which was imposed on them by the Polish Szlachta (Nobility). They believed Pilsudski to be another Polish Magnate, as from the 18th century. Thus, Petlura could not foster more than 30,000 troops.".

<li id="_note-LeninSpeach"><b><a  title="">^</a></b> At a closed meeting of the 9th Conference of the Russian Communist Party on September 22, 1920, Lenin said: "We confronted the question: whether [...] to take advantage of the enthusiasm in our army and the advantage which we enjoyed to sovietize Poland... the defensive war against imperialism was over, we won it... We could and should take advantage of the military situation to begin an offensive war... we should poke about with bayonets to see whether the socialist revolution of the proletariat had not ripened in Poland... that somewhere near Warsaw lies not [only] the center of the Polish bourgeois government and the republic of capital, but the center of the whole contemporary system of international imperialism, and that circumstances enabled us to shake that system, and to conduct politics not in Poland but in Germany and England. In this manner, in Germany and England we created a completely new zone of proletarian revolution against global imperialism... By destroying the Polish army we are destroying the Versailles Treaty on which nowadays the entire system of international relations is based.....Had Poland become Soviet....the Versailles Treaty ...and with it the whole international system arising from the victories over Germany, would have been destroyed."<br />
