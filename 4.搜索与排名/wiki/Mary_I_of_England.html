<p>Mary was the second daughter and fifth child of <a href="/wiki/Henry_VIII_of_England.html" title="Henry VIII of England">Henry VIII</a> and his first wife, <a href="/wiki/Catherine_of_Aragon.html" title="Catherine of Aragon">Catherine of Aragon</a>. A <a href="/wiki/Stillbirth.html" title="Stillbirth">stillborn</a> sister and three short-lived brothers, including the prince Henry, had preceded her. Through her mother, she was a granddaughter of <a href="/wiki/Ferdinand_II_of_Aragon.html" title="Ferdinand II of Aragon">King Ferdinand</a> and <a href="/wiki/Isabella_of_Castille.html" title="Isabella of Castille">Queen Isabella</a> of Spain, famous for driving the Muslims from the Iberian Peninsula, uniting modern <a href="/wiki/Spain.html" title="Spain">Spain</a>, and funding <a href="/wiki/Christopher_Columbus.html" title="Christopher Columbus">Christopher Columbus</a>'s voyage to the New World.</p>
<p>She was born at the <a href="/wiki/Palace_of_Placentia.html" title="Palace of Placentia">Palace of Placentia</a> in <a href="/wiki/Greenwich%2C_London.html" title="Greenwich, London">Greenwich</a>, <a href="/wiki/London.html" title="London">London</a>, on Monday <a href="/wiki/February_18.html" title="February 18">18 February</a> <a href="/wiki/1516.html" title="1516">1516</a>. She was <a href="/wiki/Baptism.html" title="Baptism">baptised</a> on the following Thursday with <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Wolsey.html" title="Thomas Wolsey">Thomas Cardinal Wolsey</a> standing as her godfather. The Princess Mary was a precocious but sickly child who had poor eyesight, sinus conditions and bad <a href="/wiki/Headache.html" title="Headache">headaches</a>.</p>
<p>Some authors believe that her poor health was from congenital <a href="/wiki/Syphilis.html" title="Syphilis">syphilis</a> transferred to her from her mother, who presumably would have contracted the disease from Mary's father. Whether or not she had the disease is debated, however, as the story emerged long after his death. Henry VIII doted on his daughter and would boast in company "This girl never cries."</p>
<p>Henry gave the Princess Mary her own court at <a href="/wiki/Ludlow_Castle.html" title="Ludlow Castle">Ludlow Castle</a> and many of the <a  class="new" title="Prerogatives">prerogatives</a> normally only given to a <a href="/wiki/Prince_of_Wales.html" title="Prince of Wales">Prince of Wales</a>, as she was acknowledged the Princess of Wales at the age of 9, even though he was deeply disappointed that she (failure to bear children was always blamed on the wife - <a href="/wiki/Haldane%27s_rule.html" title="Haldane's rule">Haldane's rule</a> was not understood) had again failed to produce a healthy son; Catherine's sixth and last child was a stillborn daughter.</p>
<p>In July 1521, when scarcely five and a half years old, she entertained some visitors with a performance on the <a href="/wiki/Harpsichord.html" title="Harpsichord">virginals</a> (a smaller harpsichord). A great part of the credit of her early education was undoubtedly due to her mother, who not only consulted the Spanish scholar <a href="/wiki/Juan_Lu%C3%ADs_Vives.html" title="Juan Luís Vives">Juan Luís Vives</a> upon the subject, but was herself the Princess Mary's first teacher in Latin. She also studied <a href="/wiki/Greek_language.html" title="Greek language">Greek</a>, <a href="/wiki/Science.html" title="Science">science</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Music.html" title="Music">music</a>.</p>
<p>Even when she was a young child, the Princess Mary's marital future was being negotiated by her father. When she was but two years old, she was promised to the <a href="/wiki/Fran%C3%A7ois%2C_Dauphin_of_France.html" title="François, Dauphin of France">Dauphin Francis</a>, son of <a href="/wiki/Francis_I_of_France.html" title="Francis I of France">Francis I, King of France</a>. After three years, the contract was repudiated; in 1522, the Princess Mary was instead contracted to her first cousin, the <a href="/wiki/Holy_Roman_Emperor.html" title="Holy Roman Emperor">Holy Roman Emperor</a> <a href="/wiki/Charles_V%2C_Holy_Roman_Emperor.html" title="Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor">Charles V</a>, then 22, by the <a href="/wiki/Treaty_of_Windsor_1522.html" title="Treaty of Windsor 1522">Treaty of Windsor</a>. Within a few years, however, the engagement was broken off. In 1526, the Princess Mary was sent to <a href="/wiki/Wales.html" title="Wales">Wales</a> to preside over the <a href="/wiki/Council_of_Wales_and_the_Marches.html" title="Council of Wales and the Marches">Council of Wales and the Marches</a>.</p>
<p>It was then suggested that the Princess Mary wed, not the Dauphin, but his father Francis I, who was eager for an alliance with England. A marriage treaty was signed; it provided that the Princess Mary should marry either Francis or his second son, <a href="/wiki/Henry_II_of_France.html" title="Henry II of France">Henry, Duke of Orléans</a>. Cardinal Wolsey, Henry VIII's chief advisor, managed to secure an alliance without a marriage.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the marriage of the Princess Mary's parents was in jeopardy. Queen Catherine had failed to provide Henry the male heir he desired; consequently, the King attempted to have his marriage to her annulled. In 1533, Henry secretly married another woman, <a href="/wiki/Anne_Boleyn.html" title="Anne Boleyn">Anne Boleyn</a>. Shortly thereafter, <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Cranmer.html" title="Thomas Cranmer">Thomas Cranmer</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Archbishop_of_Canterbury.html" title="Archbishop of Canterbury">Archbishop of Canterbury</a>, formally declared the marriage with Catherine void and the marriage with Anne valid.</p>
<p>As the <a href="/wiki/Pope_Clement_VII.html" title="Pope Clement VII">Pope</a> had previously denied him the annulment, Henry broke with the <a href="/wiki/Roman_Catholic_Church.html" title="Roman Catholic Church">Roman Catholic Church</a>. All appeals from the decisions of English ecclesiastical courts to the Pope were abolished.</p>
<p>Mary, meanwhile, was deemed illegitimate, as Henry claimed that his marriage to Catherine was officially null and void from the beginning. He claimed a biblical passage that pronounced his marriage as unclean and childless, as Catherine of Aragon (his wife) was once the child bride (at age 16) of his brother Arthur. She lost the dignity of being a Queen, being demoted to Princess Dowager of Wales. Mary's place in the line of succession was transferred to her half-sister, the Princess Elizabeth (daughter of <a href="/wiki/Anne_Boleyn.html" title="Anne Boleyn">Anne Boleyn</a>).</p>
<p>The Lady Mary was expelled from the Royal Court; her servants were dismissed from her service, and she was forced to serve as a lady-in-waiting under the Queen Anne's aunt, the <a  class="new" title="Lady Shelton">Lady Shelton</a>, to her own infant half-sister Elizabeth, then living in <a href="/wiki/Hatfield%2C_Hertfordshire.html" title="Hatfield, Hertfordshire">Hatfield</a>. She was not permitted to see her mother Catherine, or attend her funeral in 1536. Her treatment and the hatred Queen Anne had for her was perceived as unjust; all <a href="/wiki/Europe.html" title="Europe">Europe</a>, furthermore, regarded her as the only true heir and daughter of Henry VIII, although she was illegitimate under English law.</p>
<p>Mary confidently expected her troubles to end when Queen Anne lost royal favour and was beheaded in 1536. The Princess Elizabeth was also degraded to a Lady and removed from the line of succession. Henry married <a href="/wiki/Jane_Seymour.html" title="Jane Seymour">Jane Seymour</a>, who died shortly after giving birth to a son, the <a href="/wiki/Edward_VI_of_England.html" title="Edward VI of England">Prince Edward, the true Prince of Wales and Duke of Cornwall</a>. Edward lived to his mid-teens.</p>
<p>The Lady Mary's privy purse expenses for nearly the whole of this period have been published, and show that Hatfield, Beaulieu or Newhall in Essex, Richmond and Hunsdon were among her principal places of residence.</p>
<p>However, it quickly transpired that it had been Mary's father Henry, not Anne alone, who had been persecuting Mary. The only way he would grant her his favour was if she accepted humiliating attacks on her religion and royal position. The Lady Mary was tricked into reconciling with her father by submitting to him as head of the Church of England under <a href="/wiki/Jesus.html" title="Jesus">Jesus</a>, thus repudiating Papal authority, and acknowledging that the marriage between her mother and father was unlawful, thus making her illegitimate.</p>
<p>She also became godmother to her half-brother Edward and was chief mourner at Queen Jane's funeral. In turn, Henry agreed to grant her a household, and the Lady Mary was permitted to reside in royal palaces. Henry's sixth and last wife, <a href="/wiki/Catherine_Parr.html" title="Catherine Parr">Catherine Parr</a>, was able to bring the family closer together, again improving the Lady Mary's position.</p>
<p>There were several attempts to marry her off to European princes, but none of them succeeded. In 1544, Henry, through an <a href="/wiki/Act_of_Parliament.html" title="Act of Parliament">Act of Parliament</a>, returned the Lady Mary and the Lady Elizabeth to the line of succession (after their half-brother, the Prince Edward, Duke of Cornwall). Both women, however, remained legally illegitimate.</p>
<p>In 1547, Henry died, to be succeeded by Edward VI. Edward was England's first Protestant monarch; his Parliament's <a href="/wiki/Act_of_Uniformity.html" title="Act of Uniformity">Act of Uniformity</a> prescribed Protestant rites for church services, such as the use of <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Cranmer.html" title="Thomas Cranmer">Thomas Cranmer</a>'s new <i><a href="/wiki/Book_of_Common_Prayer.html" title="Book of Common Prayer">Book of Common Prayer</a></i>. The Lady Mary, desirous of maintaining the old Roman Catholic form, asked to be allowed to worship in private in her own <a href="/wiki/Chapel.html" title="Chapel">chapel</a>. After she was ordered to stop her practices, she appealed to her cousin and former matrimonial prospect, the Emperor Charles V. Charles threatened war with England if the Lady Mary's religious liberty were infringed; consequently, the Protestants at court ceased to interfere with her private rituals.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Accession">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Accession" id="Accession"></a></p>
<h2>Accession</h2>
<p>Edward VI did not desire that the Crown go to either the Lady Mary or the Lady Elizabeth; consequently, he excluded them from the line of succession in his will, which was unlawful, because it contradicted an Act of Parliament passed in 1544 restoring the Lady Mary and the Lady Elizabeth to the line of succession, and because it was made by a minor. Under the guidance of <a href="/wiki/John_Dudley%2C_1st_Duke_of_Northumberland.html" title="John Dudley, 1st Duke of Northumberland">John Dudley, 1st Duke of Northumberland</a>, Edward VI instead devised the Crown to the <a href="/wiki/Lady_Jane_Grey.html" title="Lady Jane Grey">Lady Jane Grey</a>, a descendant of Henry VIII's younger sister.</p>
<p>Thus, after Edward died on <a href="/wiki/July_6.html" title="July 6">6 July</a> <a href="/wiki/1553.html" title="1553">1553</a>, the Lady Jane Grey was proclaimed Queen. Jane's accession was met with popular disapproval, which was suppressed by the use of force. A young boy so bold as to hail "Queen Mary" was punished by having his <a href="/wiki/Ear.html" title="Ear">ears</a> cut off. Still, the country remained devoted to Mary. On <a href="/wiki/July_19.html" title="July 19">19 July</a>, Jane's accession proclamation was deemed to have been made under coercion and was revoked; instead, Mary was proclaimed Queen.</p>
<p>All support for the Lady Jane vanished and Mary rode into London triumphantly and unchallenged, with her half-sister, the Lady Elizabeth, at her side, on <a href="/wiki/August_3.html" title="August 3">3 August</a> <a href="/wiki/1553.html" title="1553">1553</a>.</p>
<p>Since the <b>Act of Succession</b> passed in 1544 recognised only Mary as Edward's heir, and since Edward's will was never authorised by statute, Mary's <i><a href="/wiki/De_jure.html" title="De jure">de jure</a></i> reign dates to <a href="/wiki/July_6.html" title="July 6">6 July</a> 1553, the date of Edward's death. Her <i><a href="/wiki/De_facto.html" title="De facto">de facto</a></i> reign, however, dates to <a href="/wiki/July_19.html" title="July 19">19 July</a> <a href="/wiki/1553.html" title="1553">1553</a>, when Jane was deposed. One of her first actions as <a href="/wiki/Monarch.html" title="Monarch">monarch</a> was to order the release of the Catholic <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Howard%2C_3rd_Duke_of_Norfolk.html" title="Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk">Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk</a> and <a href="/wiki/Stephen_Gardiner.html" title="Stephen Gardiner">Stephen Gardiner</a> from imprisonment in the <a href="/wiki/Tower_of_London.html" title="Tower of London">Tower of London</a>.</p>
<p>Originally, Mary was inclined to exercise clemency, and initially set the Lady Jane Grey free, recognising that the young girl was forced to take the Crown by her father-in-law.

<h2>Reign</h2>
<p>Mary's first act of Parliament retroactively validated Henry VIII's marriage to Catherine of Aragon, and legitimated the Queen.</p>
<p>Now 37, Mary turned her attention to procuring a husband to father an heir in order to prevent her half-sister, the Lady Elizabeth, from succeeding to the throne. She rejected <a href="/wiki/Edward_Courtenay%2C_1st_Earl_of_Devon_%281553_creation%29.html" title="Edward Courtenay, 1st Earl of Devon (1553 creation)">Edward Courtenay, 1st Earl of Devon</a>, as a prospect when her first cousin, the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, suggested that she marry his only son, the <a href="/wiki/Spain.html" title="Spain">Spanish</a> prince <a href="/wiki/Philip_II_of_Spain.html" title="Philip II of Spain">Philip</a>.</p>
<p>The marriage, a purely political alliance for Philip, who admired her dignity but felt "no carnal love for her", was extremely unpopular with the English. Lord Chancellor Gardiner and the <a href="/wiki/British_House_of_Commons.html" title="British House of Commons">House of Commons</a> petitioned her to consider marrying an Englishman, fearing that England would be relegated to a dependency of Spain. The fear of dependency was due in large part to the inexperience of having a <a href="/wiki/Queen_regnant.html" title="Queen regnant">queen regnant</a>, as Mary was truly England's first (Lady Jane had only reigned nine days).</p>
<p>Insurrections broke out across the country when she refused. The Duke of Suffolk once again proclaimed that his daughter, the Lady Jane Grey, was Queen. The young <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Wyatt_the_younger.html" title="Thomas Wyatt the younger">Sir Thomas Wyatt</a> led a force from <a href="/wiki/Kent.html" title="Kent">Kent</a>, and was not defeated until he had arrived at London's gates. After the rebellions were crushed, both the Duke of Suffolk and the Lady Jane Grey were convicted of <a href="/wiki/High_treason.html" title="High treason">high treason</a> and executed. Since the rebellion was designed to put her on the throne, the Lady Elizabeth was imprisoned in the <a href="/wiki/Tower_of_London.html" title="Tower of London">Tower of London</a>, but was put under house arrest in <a href="/wiki/Woodstock_Palace.html" title="Woodstock Palace">Woodstock Palace</a> after two months.</p>

</div>
<p>Mary married Philip on <a href="/wiki/July_25.html" title="July 25">25 July</a> <a href="/wiki/1554.html" title="1554">1554</a>, at <a href="/wiki/Winchester_Cathedral.html" title="Winchester Cathedral">Winchester Cathedral</a>. Under the terms of the marriage treaty, Philip was to be styled "King of England", all official documents (including Acts of Parliament) were to be dated with both their names and Parliament was to be called under the joint authority of the couple. Philip's powers, however, were extremely limited; he and Mary were not true joint Sovereigns.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Philip was the only man to take the crown matrimonial upon his marriage to a reigning Queen of England; <a href="/wiki/William_III_of_England.html" title="William III of England">William III</a> became jointly sovereign with his wife, <a href="/wiki/Mary_II_of_England.html" title="Mary II of England">Mary II</a>, pursuant to Act of Parliament, rather than matrimonial right. <a href="/wiki/Coin.html" title="Coin">Coins</a> were to also show the head of both Mary and Philip. The marriage treaty further provided that England would not be obliged to provide military support to Philip's father, the Holy Roman Emperor, in any war.</p>
<p>Mary fell in love with Philip and, thinking she was pregnant, had thanksgiving services at the diocese of London in November 1554. But Philip found his queen, who was eleven years his senior, to be physically unattractive and after only fourteen months left for Spain under a false excuse. Mary suffered a <a href="/wiki/False_pregnancy.html" title="False pregnancy">false pregnancy</a>; Philip released the Lady Elizabeth from house arrest probably so that he could be viewed favourably by her in case Mary died during childbirth.</p>
<p>Mary then turned her attention to religious issues. She had always rejected the break with Rome instituted by her father. Her half-brother, Edward, had established Protestantism; Mary wished to revert to Roman Catholicism. England was reconciled with Rome, and <a href="/wiki/Reginald_Cardinal_Pole.html" title="Reginald Cardinal Pole">Reginald Cardinal Pole</a> (once considered as her suitor and son of her own governess the Countess of Salisbury), who would become an adviser Mary very heavily depended upon, became <a href="/wiki/Archbishop_of_Canterbury.html" title="Archbishop of Canterbury">Archbishop of Canterbury</a>, after Mary had his predecessor executed.</p>
<p>Edward's religious laws were abolished by Mary's first Parliament and numerous Protestant leaders were executed in the so-called <a href="/wiki/Marian_Persecutions.html" title="Marian Persecutions">Marian Persecutions</a>. The first to die were <a href="/wiki/John_Rogers_%28religious%29.html" title="John Rogers (religious)">John Rogers</a> (<a href="/wiki/February_4.html" title="February 4">4 February</a> <a href="/wiki/1555.html" title="1555">1555</a>), <a href="/wiki/Laurence_Saunders.html" title="Laurence Saunders">Laurence Saunders</a> (<a href="/wiki/February_8.html" title="February 8">8 February</a> <a href="/wiki/1555.html" title="1555">1555</a>), <a href="/wiki/Rowland_Taylor.html" title="Rowland Taylor">Rowland Taylor</a> (<a href="/wiki/February_9.html" title="February 9">9 February</a> <a href="/wiki/1555.html" title="1555">1555</a>), and <a href="/wiki/John_Hooper.html" title="John Hooper">John Hooper</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Bishop_of_Gloucester.html" title="Bishop of Gloucester">Bishop of Gloucester</a> (<a href="/wiki/February_9.html" title="February 9">9 February</a> <a href="/wiki/1555.html" title="1555">1555</a>). The persecution lasted for three and three-quarter years.</p>
<p>Having inherited the throne of Spain upon his father's abdication, Philip returned to England from March to July 1557 to persuade Mary to join with Spain in a war against France in the <a href="/wiki/Italian_Wars.html" title="Italian Wars">Italian Wars</a>. Meanwhile, England was full of faction, and seditious pamphlets of Protestant origin inflamed the people with hatred against the Spaniards.</p>
<p>But perhaps the strangest thing about the situation was that <a href="/wiki/Pope_Paul_IV.html" title="Pope Paul IV">Pope Paul IV</a> sided with France against Spain. English forces fared badly in the conflict, and as a result the Kingdom lost <a href="/wiki/Calais.html" title="Calais">Calais</a>, its last remaining continental possession. Mary later lamented that when she lay dead the words "Philip" and "Calais" would be found inscribed on her <a href="/wiki/Heart.html" title="Heart">heart</a>.</p>
<p>Mary persuaded Parliament to repeal the Protestant religious laws passed by Edward and Henry before her. But it took several years to persuade Parliament to go all the way. And to get their agreement, she had to make a major concession: tens of thousands of acres of monastery lands confiscated under Henry were not returned to the monasteries. The new group of landowners that had been set up by this distribution remained very influential.</p>
<p>Mary also set in motion currency reform to counteract the dramatic devaluation of the currency overseen by <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Gresham.html" title="Thomas Gresham">Thomas Gresham</a> that characterized the last few years of Henry VIII's reign and the reign of Edward VI. These measures, however, were largely unsuccessful. Mary's deep religious convictions also inspired her to institute social reforms, although these were unsuccessful as well.</p>
<p>Under her reign, in another of the <a href="/wiki/Plantations_of_Ireland.html" title="Plantations of Ireland">Plantations of Ireland</a>, English colonists were settled in the Irish midlands to reduce the attacks on <a href="/wiki/The_Pale.html" title="The Pale">the Pale</a> (the colony around <a href="/wiki/Dublin.html" title="Dublin">Dublin</a>).</p>
<p>Two counties were created in Ireland and, in her honour, were named <a href="/wiki/County_Laois.html" title="County Laois">Queens County</a> (now Laois) and, for Philip, <a href="/wiki/County_Offaly.html" title="County Offaly">Kings County</a> (now Offaly). The county town of Queens County was called <a href="/wiki/Portlaoise.html" title="Portlaoise">Maryborough</a> (now Portlaoise).</p>

<h2>Death</h2>
<p>During her reign, Mary's weak health led her to suffer two false pregnancies. After such a delusion in 1558, Mary decreed in her will that her husband Philip should be the regent during the minority of her child. No child, however, was born, and Mary died at the age of forty-two, most probably of ovarian cancer at St. James's Palace on <a href="/wiki/November_17.html" title="November 17">17 November</a> <a href="/wiki/1558.html" title="1558">1558</a>.</p>
<p>She was succeeded by her half-sister, who became <a href="/wiki/Elizabeth_I_of_England.html" title="Elizabeth I of England">Elizabeth I</a>. Mary was interred in Westminster Abbey on <a href="/wiki/December_14.html" title="December 14">14 December</a>, in a tomb she would eventually share with her sister, Elizabeth.</p>
<p>The Latin inscription on a marble plaque on their tomb (affixed there during the reign of <a href="/wiki/King_James_I.html" title="King James I">King James I</a>) translates to "Partners both in Throne and grave, here rest we two sisters, Elizabeth and Mary, in the hope of one resurrection".</p>

<h2>Legacy</h2>
<p>Although Mary enjoyed tremendous popular support and sympathy for her mistreatment during the earliest parts of her reign, she lost almost all of it after marrying Philip. Many English viewed the marriage as a breach of English independence; they felt that it would make England a mere dependency of Spain. The marriage treaty clearly specified that England was not to be drawn into any Spanish wars, but this guarantee proved meaningless. Philip spent most of his time governing his Spanish and European territories, and little of it with his wife in England. After Mary's death, Philip became a suitor for Elizabeth's hand, but Elizabeth refused him.</p>
<p>The persecution of Protestants earned Mary the appellation "Bloody Mary", although her successor and half-sister, Elizabeth, more than balanced the number killed under Mary with Catholic persecution, both in total and frequency.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a  title="">[1]</a></sup> During Mary's five-year reign, 283 individuals were <a href="/wiki/Burning_at_the_stake.html" title="Burning at the stake">burnt at the stake</a>, twice as many as had suffered the same fate during the previous century and a half of English history, and at a greater rate than under the contemporary <a href="/wiki/Spanish_Inquisition.html" title="Spanish Inquisition">Spanish Inquisition</a>. Several notable clerics were executed; among them were the former Archbishop of Canterbury <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Cranmer.html" title="Thomas Cranmer">Thomas Cranmer</a>, the former <a href="/wiki/Bishop_of_London.html" title="Bishop of London">Bishop of London</a> <a href="/wiki/Nicholas_Ridley_%28martyr%29.html" title="Nicholas Ridley (martyr)">Nicholas Ridley</a> and the reformist <a href="/wiki/Hugh_Latimer.html" title="Hugh Latimer">Hugh Latimer</a>. <a href="/wiki/John_Foxe.html" title="John Foxe">John Foxe</a> vilified her in a book entitled "<i>The Actes and Monuments of these latter and perilous Dayes, touching matters of the Church, wherein are comprehended and described the great Persecution and horrible Troubles that have been wrought and practised by the Romishe Prelates, Epeciallye in this Realme of England and Scotland, from the yeare of our Lorde a thousande to the time now present</i>," commonly called "<i>The Book of Martyrs</i>." It is said that the Spanish ambassadors were aghast at how the English people reviled her and at the jubilation and celebration of the people upon her death. Many historians believe, however, that Mary does not deserve all the blame that has been cast upon her.</p>
<p>Mary did not have many successes. She was, however, known for her "common touch". Mary would dress up in a certain country's dress when meeting that country's ambassador. And all of those who waited upon her personally later expressed great love and loyalty to her.</p>
<p>One popular tradition traces the <a href="/wiki/Nursery_rhyme.html" title="Nursery rhyme">nursery rhyme</a> <i><a href="/wiki/Mary%2C_Mary%2C_Quite_Contrary.html" title="Mary, Mary, Quite Contrary">Mary, Mary, Quite Contrary</a></i> to Mary's attempts to bring Roman Catholicism back to England, identifying the "<a href="/wiki/Cockle.html" title="Cockle">cockle</a> <a href="/wiki/Animal_shell.html" title="Animal shell">shells</a>", for example, with the symbol of <a href="/wiki/Pilgrimage.html" title="Pilgrimage">pilgrimage</a> to the <a href="/wiki/Shrine.html" title="Shrine">shrine</a> of <a href="/wiki/Saint_James_the_Great.html" title="Saint James the Great">Saint James</a> in <a href="/wiki/Santiago_de_Compostela.html" title="Santiago de Compostela">Spain</a> and the "pretty maids all in a row" with <a href="/wiki/Nun.html" title="Nun">nuns</a>. Another tradition has it that the rhyme was based on the life of Mary's cousin, <a href="/wiki/Mary_I_of_Scotland.html" title="Mary I of Scotland">Mary, Queen of Scots</a>. There is however no proof that the rhyme was known before the 18th century: see its article for more information.</p>

(Historically, Mary was not present at the time.)</p>
<p>In 1971, the <a href="/wiki/BBC.html" title="BBC">British Broadcasting Corporation</a> broadcast the six-part television series <i><a href="/wiki/The_Six_Wives_of_Henry_VIII.html" title="The Six Wives of Henry VIII">The Six Wives of Henry VIII</a></i>.

<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Style and arms">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Style_and_arms" id="Style_and_arms"></a></p>
<h2>Style and arms</h2>
<p>Like Henry VIII and Edward VI, Mary used the style "Majesty", as well as "Highness" and "Grace". "Majesty", which Henry VIII first used on a consistent basis, did not become exclusive until the reign of Elizabeth I's successor, <a href="/wiki/James_I_of_England.html" title="James I of England">James I</a>.</p>
<p>When Mary ascended the throne, she was proclaimed under the same official style as Henry VIII and Edward VI: "Mary, by the Grace of <a href="/wiki/God.html" title="God">God</a>, <a href="/wiki/List_of_monarchs_of_England.html" title="List of monarchs of England">Queen of England</a>, <a href="/wiki/English_Kings_of_France.html" title="English Kings of France">France</a> and <a href="/wiki/Kingdom_of_Ireland.html" title="Kingdom of Ireland">Ireland</a>, <a href="/wiki/Fidei_defensor.html" title="Fidei defensor">Defender of the Faith</a>, and of the <a href="/wiki/Church_of_England.html" title="Church of England">Church of England</a> and also of <a href="/wiki/Church_of_Ireland.html" title="Church of Ireland">Ireland</a> in <a href="/wiki/Earth.html" title="Earth">Earth</a> Supreme Head".</p>
<p>The "supremacy phrase" at the end of the style was repugnant to Mary's <a href="/wiki/Catholic.html" title="Catholic">Catholic</a> <a href="/wiki/Faith.html" title="Faith">faith</a>; from 1554 onwards, she omitted the phrase without statutory authority, which was not retroactively granted by Parliament until 1555.</p>
<p>Under Mary's marriage treaty with <a href="/wiki/Philip_II_of_Spain.html" title="Philip II of Spain">Philip II of Spain</a>, the couple were jointly styled King and Queen. The official joint style reflected not only Mary's but also Philip's dominions and claims; it was "Philip and Mary, by the grace of God, King and Queen of England, France, <a href="/wiki/Kingdom_of_Naples.html" title="Kingdom of Naples">Naples</a>, <a href="/wiki/Kings_of_Jerusalem.html" title="Kings of Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>, <a href="/wiki/Reino_de_Chile.html" title="Reino de Chile">Chile</a> and Ireland, Defenders of the Faith, <a href="/wiki/Prince.html" title="Prince">Princes</a> of <a href="/wiki/Spain.html" title="Spain">Spain</a> and <a href="/wiki/Sicily.html" title="Sicily">Sicily</a>, <a href="/wiki/Archduke.html" title="Archduke">Archdukes</a> of <a href="/wiki/Austria.html" title="Austria">Austria</a>, Dukes of <a href="/wiki/Rulers_of_Milan.html" title="Rulers of Milan">Milan</a>, <a href="/wiki/Duke_of_Burgundy.html" title="Duke of Burgundy">Burgundy</a> and <a href="/wiki/Duke_of_Brabant.html" title="Duke of Brabant">Brabant</a>, Counts of <a href="/wiki/Habsburg.html" title="Habsburg">Habsburg</a>, <a href="/wiki/Count_of_Flanders.html" title="Count of Flanders">Flanders</a> and <a href="/wiki/Tyrol.html" title="Tyrol">Tyrol</a>".</p>
<p>This style, which had been in use since 1554, was replaced when Philip inherited the Spanish Crown in 1556 with "Philip and Mary, by the Grace of God King and Queen of England, <a href="/wiki/List_of_Spanish_monarchs.html" title="List of Spanish monarchs">Spain</a>, France, Jerusalem, both the Sicilies and Ireland, Defenders of the Faith, Archdukes of Austria, Dukes of Burgundy, Milan and Brabant, Counts of Habsburg, Flanders and Tyrol".</p>
<p>Mary I's <a href="/wiki/Heraldry.html" title="Heraldry">arms</a> were the same as those used by her predecessors since <a href="/wiki/Henry_IV_of_England.html" title="Henry IV of England">Henry IV</a>: <i>Quarterly, Azure three fleurs-de-lys Or (for France) and Gules three lions passant guardant in pale Or (for England)</i>. Sometimes, Mary's arms were impaled (depicted side-by-side) with those of her husband.</p>
