<p>The <a  title="WP:ARBCOM">Arbitration Committee</a> opened one new case this week, and closed four cases.</p>
<p><a name="Closed_cases" id="Closed_cases"></a></p>
<h3>Closed cases</h3>
<ul>
<li><b><a  title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Ericsaindon2">Ericsaindon2</a>:</b> Closed on Sunday after one and a half months, a case involving the actions of <a  title="User:Ericsaindon2">Ericsaindon2</a>, <a  title="User:Coolcaesar">Coolcaesar</a> and <a  title="User:Will Beback">Will Beback</a>. Coolcaesar claimed that Ericsaindon2 had tried to insert original research, had disrupted Wikipedia, used sockpuppets, uploaded images violating copyright law, and failed to assume good faith. In response, Ericsaindon2 claimed that Coolcaesar had contributed equally to the dispute, and that Will Beback had misused admin powers, in particular with incorrect and biased application of the <a  title="WP:3RR">3RR</a>. Ericsaindon2 was restricted to one account, banned for one year, and placed on Probation.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b><a  title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Israeli apartheid">Israeli apartheid</a>:</b> Closed on Saturday after two months, a case involving the actions of editors and administrators on <a href="/wiki/Allegations_of_Israeli_apartheid.html" title="Allegations of Israeli apartheid">Allegations of Israeli apartheid</a> (formerly at <a href="/wiki/Israeli_apartheid.html" title="Israeli apartheid">Israeli apartheid</a>). The article was the site of a move war during a poll to determine the article's naming. Remedies were passed encouraging negotiation and mediation, admonishing administrators involved in the dispute, directing discussion of issues to <a  title="Wikipedia:Central discussions/Apartheid">Wikipedia:Central discussions/Apartheid</a>, and granting an amnesty to all users except <a  title="User:Zeq">Zeq</a>, who remained banned from the article.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b><a  title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Eternal Equinox">Eternal Equinox</a>:</b> Closed on Wednesday after two months, a case involving <a  title="User:Eternal Equinox">Eternal Equinox</a>. Several users complained that Eternal Equinox had been trying to claim <a  title="Wikipedia:Ownership of articles">ownership of articles</a> with edit wars and abuse directed at those who tried to edit them. Eternal Equinox claimed to have left Wikipedia, but the other parties argued that this was not credible because of a number of similar statements made previously. Eternal Equinox had since returned, editing anonymously from several related IP addresses while acknowledging his or her identity. Eternal Equinox was placed on probation and personal attack parole, and <a  title="User:Jim62sch">Jim62sch</a> was cautioned to "avoid teasing or taunting sensitive users".</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b><a  title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Añoranza">Añoranza</a>:</b> Closed on Tuesday after two months, a case involving <a  title="User:Añoranza">Añoranza</a>. Users asserted that Añoranza had been incivil, and had filed a retaliatory <a  title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Zer0faults">request for comment</a> and <a  title="Wikipedia:Requests for checkuser/Case/Zer0faults">request for checkuser</a>. The dispute involved the usage of terms such as "Operation Iraqi Liberation" for the <a href="/wiki/2003_invasion_of_Iraq.html" title="2003 invasion of Iraq">2003 invasion of Iraq</a>. Añoranza was banned for one week for the disruptive way in which he went about bringing the terms to light and the parties were encouraged to enter into good-faith negotiations into the matter.</li>
</ul>
<p><a name="New_case" id="New_case"></a></p>
<h3>New case</h3>
<ul>
<li><b><a  title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Ackoz">Ackoz</a>:</b> A case involving the actions and community ban of <a  title="User:Ackoz">Ackoz</a>, and his later account, <a  title="User:Azmoc">Azomc</a>. The user previously contributed to Wikipedia under the name Ackoz, but, after being banned for three days, elected to leave. After a while, he decided to return, and admits to "some trolling" since then. However, he has stated that were he unblocked, he would cease his disruptive behaviour, and would be prepared to undergo mentorship. Some administrators, however, believe that he should nonetheless remain blocked.</li>
</ul>
<p><a name="Evidence_phase" id="Evidence_phase"></a></p>
<h3>Evidence phase</h3>
<ul>
<li><b><a  title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Marudubshinki">Marudubshinki</a>:</b> A case involving the actions of <a  title="User:Marudubshinki">Marudubshinki</a>. <a  title="User:Snottygobble">Snottygobble</a>, <a  title="User:I@n">I@n</a> and others allege that Marudubshinki has operated an unauthorised bot, and misused his sysop powers by unblocking himself and allowing his bot to delete pages. Marudubshinki has not presented a statement in his defence.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b><a  title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/MONGO">MONGO</a>:</b> A case involving the actions of <a  title="User:MONGO">MONGO</a>, <a  title="User:Rootology">rootology</a>, and others. The case centers around <a  class="external text" title="http://encyclopediadramatica.com" rel="nofollow">Encyclopædia Dramatica</a>, and an article posted on the site portraying MONGO in a negative light.</li>
</ul>
<p><a name="Voting_phase" id="Voting_phase"></a></p>
<h3>Voting phase</h3>
<ul>
<li><b><a  title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Ed Poor 2">Ed Poor 2</a>:</b> A case involving <a  title="User:Ed Poor">Ed Poor</a>. <a  title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> and <a  title="User:Consumed Crustacean">Consumed Crustacean</a> have accused Poor of POV pushing and disruption; Poor has not introduced evidence in the case. Ed Poor was party to two prior cases; the <a  title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Ed Poor">first</a> was closed after Poor resigned his status as a <a  title="Wikipedia:Bureaucrats">bureaucrat</a>, and the <a  title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/FuelWagon v. Ed Poor">second</a> resulted in his desysopping. Fred Bauder has proposed a remedy placing him on probation, but no other arbitrators have yet commented.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b><a  title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Pat8722">Pat8722</a>:</b> A case involving the actions of <a  title="User:Pat8722">Pat8722</a>. <a  title="User:BorgHunter">BorgHunter</a> has accused Pat8722 of edit-warring. Pat8722 has requested that the ArbCom stay the case while he pursues 6 <i>pro se</i> cases in the American courts, and has agreed not to edit Wikipedia in the interim. Fred Bauder has proposed a motion establishing the principle of a "continuance", and a remedy extending this to Pat8722. However, no other arbitrators have yet commented on the matter.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b><a  title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/St Christopher">St Christopher</a>:</b> A case involving <a href="/wiki/St_Christopher_Iba_Mar_Diop_College_of_Medicine.html" title="St Christopher Iba Mar Diop College of Medicine">St Christopher Iba Mar Diop College of Medicine</a>, a school whose accreditation status is in dispute, and in particular the behaviour of <a  title="User:ParalelUni">ParalelUni</a> on the page. Dmcdevit has proposed remedies affirming the community ban of ParalelUni, and banning all single-purpose accounts from editing the article, which have been supported by Fred Bauder.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b><a  title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Kehrli">Kehrli</a>:</b> A case involving the actions of <a  title="User:Nick Y.">Nick Y</a> and <a  title="User:Kehrli">Kherli</a> on <a href="/wiki/Mass-to-charge_ratio.html" title="Mass-to-charge ratio">Mass-to-charge ratio</a> and related articles. Both protagonists accuse each other of POV pushing, adding unsourced information, and adding dispute tags without reason. Fred Bauder has proposed remedies banning Kehrli from articles relating to <a href="/wiki/M/z.html" title="M/z">M/z</a>, and from changing the notation <i>m/z</i> where found to any other notation.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b><a  title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Israel-Lebanon">Israel-Lebanon</a>:</b> A case involving the actions of <a  title="User:AdamKesher">AdamKesher</a>, <a  title="User:Tasc">Tasc</a> and others on <a href="/wiki/2006_Israel-Lebanon_conflict.html" title="2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict">2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict</a>. AdamKesher accuses Tasc of removing relevant external links which satisfy <a  title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a>, and he denies the allegation. In response, <a  title="User:Denis Diderot">Denis Diderot</a> accuses Kesher of "using Wikipedia as a tool to promote his POV". Fred Bauder has proposed remedies permitting the linking to blogs which offer contemporary comment on a current event from Wikipedia pages, cautioning all editors to use common sense above literal interpretation of Wikipedia policy, and permitting any editor "particularly Tasc", to be banned from the article for an "appropriate period" should they engage in edit warring on the issue. These proposals have yet to be commented on.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b><a  title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Deir Yassin massacre">Deir Yassin massacre</a>:</b> A case involving the actions of <a  title="User:KimvdLinde">KimvdLinde</a> and <a  title="User:Guy Montag">Guy Montag</a> on <a href="/wiki/Deir_Yassin_massacre.html" title="Deir Yassin massacre">Deir Yassin massacre</a>. KimvdLinde alleges that Montag has violated his <a  title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Yuber">probation</a> by rewriting the article, unilaterally moving it to "Battle of Deir Yassin", violating copyright and votestacking. In return, Montag refuses "to participate in any of these proceedings", and alleges that KimvdLinde has abused her admin tools by exercising them in a dispute in which she is involved. Fred Bauder has proposed remedies banning Montag from articles relating to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and suggested that Montag's probation be extended. These remedies have attracted the support of three other arbitrators.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b><a  title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Warren Kinsella">Warren Kinsella</a>:</b> A case involving the actions of <a  title="User:Arthur Ellis">Arthur Ellis</a>, <a  title="User:Pete Peters">Pete Peters</a> and others on the <a href="/wiki/Warren_Kinsella.html" title="Warren Kinsella">Warren Kinsella</a> article. Both users accuse the other of disruptive edits on the page, and Peters and others acccuse Ellis of sockpuppetry using anon accounts, while Ellis alleges that administrators dealt inequitably with him and Peters. Fred Bauder has proposed remedies banning Ellis indefinitely from all articles relating to "Canadian politics and its blogosphere", and limiting him to one account. Charles Matthews has indicated his support for these proposals.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b><a  title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Zer0faults">Zer0faults</a>:</b> A case involving the actions of <a  title="User:Zer0faults">Zer0faults</a> and <a  title="User:Nescio">Nescio</a> on <a  title="Template:War on Terrorism">Template:War on Terrorism</a>, <a href="/wiki/War_on_Terror.html" title="War on Terror">War on Terror</a> and related arguments. Nescio alleges that Zer0faults has engaged in violation of <a  title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>, disruptive editing, and "uncivil remarks". In return, Zer0faults alleges that Nescio has failed to <a  title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a>, violated <a  title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> and <a  title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, and failed to provide explanations for his reverts. A single remedy that would place Zer0faults on probation was proposed by <a  title="User:Fred Bauder">Fred Bauder</a>, and has the support of three arbitrators.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b><a  title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Intangible">Intangible</a>:</b> A case involving the actions of <a  title="User:Intangible">Intangible</a>. <a  title="User:Cberlet">Cberlet</a> alleges that Intangible has used an "aggressive and confrontational" editing style to push his POV (partly through the wholesale deletion of the term "far right" from numerous pages), making sweeping edits and reverts with little or no discussion, and being "contentious and confrontational" in talk page discussions. Intangible vigorously denies the allegations. A remedy, supported by six arbitrators, would place Intangible on probation. Other remedies, proposed by Dmcdevit, and supported by two and three arbitrators respectively, but opposed by Fred Bauder, would also place <a  title="User:Tazmaniacs">Tazmaniacs</a> and <a  class="new" title="User:AaronS">AaronS</a> on probation.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b><a  title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Sathya Sai Baba">Sathya Sai Baba</a>:</b> A case involving <a  title="User:Andries">Andries</a> and <a  title="User:SSS108">SSS108</a>'s actions on the article <a href="/wiki/Sathya_Sai_Baba.html" title="Sathya Sai Baba">Sathya Sai Baba</a>. Both have accused each other of "POV pushing", and violating Wikipedia's policy on <a  title="WP:NOR">original research</a>. Proposed remedies that unsourced or poorly sourced information be removed from these articles, and a complete amnesty for Andries and SSS108 for any unreliable information they may have added in the past have the support of five arbitrators.</li>
</ul>
<p><a name="Motion_to_close" id="Motion_to_close"></a></p>

<ul>
<li><b><a  title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/CoolKatt number 99999">CoolKatt number 99999</a>:</b> A case involving the actions of <a  title="User:CoolKatt number 99999">CoolKatt number 99999</a> on <a href="/wiki/WWOR-TV.html" title="WWOR-TV">WWOR-TV</a> and related articles, as well as the actions of <a  title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a>, <a  title="User:Kramden4700">Kramden4700</a> and others. A <a  title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/CoolKatt number 99999">temporary injunction</a> has been enacted, which bans CoolKatt from editing pages other than his own user pages and the arbitration pages for the duration of the case.
