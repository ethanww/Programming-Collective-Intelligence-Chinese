<h2>History</h2>
<p>The 68000 grew out of the <b>MACSS</b> (<a  class="new" title="Motorola Advanced Computer System on Silicon">Motorola Advanced Computer System on Silicon</a>) project, begun in <a href="/wiki/1976.html" title="1976">1976</a>. One of the early decisions made was to develop a new "no compromise" architecture that paid little attention to <a href="/wiki/Backward_compatibility.html" title="Backward compatibility">backward compatibility</a>. This was a gamble because it would mean adopters of the chip would have to learn the new system entirely from scratch. In the end, the only concession to backward compatibility was a hardware one: the 68k could interface to existing <a href="/wiki/Motorola_6800.html" title="Motorola 6800">6800</a> peripheral devices, but could not run 6800 code. However, the designers built-in a tremendous amount of <a href="/wiki/Forward_compatibility.html" title="Forward compatibility">forward compatibility</a>, which paid off once 68k expertise had been gained by end users. The MACSS team drew heavily on the influence of mainframe processor design, such as the <a href="/wiki/PDP-11.html" title="PDP-11">PDP-11</a> and <a href="/wiki/VAX.html" title="VAX">VAX</a> systems. The instruction set was developed with software development in mind more than hardware limitations; the idea was that developers familiar with these older systems would be comfortable programming the new microprocessor.</p>
<p>As the new design reached production a trade name had to be selected. The name "68000" was selected largely to provide some naming and marketing continuity with the earlier 6800, although there was little in common between the two designs. The name was justified by claiming the chip featured about 68,000 transistors, but in fact the count was closer to 70,000.</p>
<p>At the time, there was fierce competition among several of the then established manufacturers of 8-bit processors to bring out 16-bit designs. Intel was first, with the <a href="/wiki/Intel_8086.html" title="Intel 8086">Intel 8086</a>, but Motorola marketing made a point of the 68000 being a much more complete 16-bit design. This was reflected in the complexity. The transistor cell count, which was a fairly direct measure of power in that era, was more than twice that of the 29,000 cells of the 8086.</p>
<p>Initial samples of the MC68000 were released in <a href="/wiki/1979.html" title="1979">1979</a>. By <a href="/wiki/1982.html" title="1982">1982</a>, the 68000 was clocked at an at-the-time speedy 8 <a href="/wiki/Megahertz.html" title="Megahertz">MHz</a>, with the simplest instructions taking four clock cycles but the most complex ones requiring many more, and an assumed average of 1 <a href="/wiki/Instructions_per_second.html" title="Instructions per second">MIPS</a>.</p>
<p>On average, the MC68000's instructions in typical program code did more work per instruction than competing Intel processors, which meant that 68000 designs both needed less RAM and were faster. Additionally, the MC68000 offered a "flat" 24-bit addressing system supporting up to 16 MB of memory, at the time a large memory space. In comparison, the Intel chips initially used a <a href="/wiki/Memory_segment.html" title="Memory segment">segmented system</a> which is much more difficult to work with, a feature that they were forced to carry forward for some time. This made the 68000 both easier to work with, and conceptually "cleaner", which led many engineers to prefer it over the seemingly backward Intel designs.</p>
<p>The MC68000 earned design wins in early (1980s) personal computers, such as the <a href="/wiki/Apple_Macintosh.html" title="Apple Macintosh">Apple Macintosh</a>, <a href="/wiki/Commodore_International.html" title="Commodore International">Commodore</a> <a href="/wiki/Amiga.html" title="Amiga">Amiga</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Atari.html" title="Atari">Atari</a> <a href="/wiki/Atari_ST.html" title="Atari ST">ST</a>. It also found use in entry-level workstations: <a href="/wiki/HP_9000.html" title="HP 9000">HP 9000s</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/Sun_Microsystems.html" title="Sun Microsystems">Sun Microsystems</a> <a href="/wiki/Unix.html" title="Unix">UNIX</a> and <a href="/wiki/Apollo/Domain.html" title="Apollo/Domain">Apollo/Domain</a>. In the <a href="/wiki/Silicon_Graphics.html" title="Silicon Graphics">Silicon Graphics</a>'s IRIS 1000 and 1200 terminals, the 68000 was also used. MC68000 derivatives persisted in the UNIX market for many years, because the architecture so strongly resembles the Digital <a href="/wiki/PDP-11.html" title="PDP-11">PDP-11</a> and <a href="/wiki/VAX.html" title="VAX">VAX</a>, and is an excellent computer for running <a href="/wiki/C_programming_language.html" title="C programming language">C</a> code.</p>
<p>The 68000 eventually saw its greatest success as a controller. In 1987 <a href="/wiki/Apple_Computer.html" title="Apple Computer">Apple Computer</a> introduced their first <a href="/wiki/LaserWriter.html" title="LaserWriter">LaserWriter</a>, featuring a 12 MHz MC68000 running <a href="/wiki/PostScript.html" title="PostScript">PostScript</a>. Other printer companies copied the basic design, and thousands of <a href="/wiki/Hewlett-Packard.html" title="Hewlett-Packard">HP</a>, <a href="/wiki/Printronix.html" title="Printronix">Printronix</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Adobe_Systems.html" title="Adobe Systems">Adobe</a> <a href="/wiki/Computer_printer.html" title="Computer printer">printers</a> used it. Its derivative <a href="/wiki/Microcontroller.html" title="Microcontroller">microcontrollers</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Motorola_CPU32.html" title="Motorola CPU32">CPU32</a> and <a href="/wiki/Motorola_ColdFire.html" title="Motorola ColdFire">ColdFire</a> processors, have been manufactured in the millions as automotive engine controllers. It also sees use by medical manufacturers and many printer manufacturers because of its low cost, convenience, and good stability. The addressing modes of the <a href="/wiki/68020.html" title="68020">68020</a> were influenced by this, making that derivative excellent for page printing in laser printers.</p>
<p>As technological advances obsoleted the MC68000 from use in the standalone computing market, its use grew in consumer and embedded applications. In video entertainment systems (both home and coin-op), the MC68000 was the backbone of many game consoles: the <a href="/wiki/Sega_Genesis.html" title="Sega Genesis">Sega Genesis</a>/<a href="/wiki/Sega_MegaDrive.html" title="Sega MegaDrive">MegaDrive</a>, <a href="/wiki/Sega_CD.html" title="Sega CD">Sega CD</a>, <a href="/wiki/NeoGeo.html" title="NeoGeo">NeoGeo</a>, Capcom CPS-1/2, Sega System 16, used the MC68000 as the main CPU. (Along with individual arcade coin-op machines, such as Atari's classic <a href="/wiki/Marble_Madness.html" title="Marble Madness">Marble Madness</a>.) Later game consoles (such as the <a href="/wiki/Sega_Saturn.html" title="Sega Saturn">Sega Saturn</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Atari_Jaguar.html" title="Atari Jaguar">Atari Jaguar</a>) stil included the MC68000. In the Saturn, the 68000 functioned as a dedicated sound controller, and in the <a href="/wiki/Atari_Jaguar.html" title="Atari Jaguar">Atari Jaguar</a> the MC68000 co-ordinated the activities of the other specialized graphics/sound ICs.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Motorola_DragonBall.html" title="Motorola DragonBall">DragonBall</a> low-voltage versions of the processor were used in the popular <a href="/wiki/Palm_Pilot.html" title="Palm Pilot">Palm Pilot</a> series of PDAs from <a href="/wiki/Palm_Computing.html" title="Palm Computing">Palm Computing</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Handspring_Visor.html" title="Handspring Visor">Handspring Visor</a>, until the architecture was gradually phased out in favor of the <a href="/wiki/ARM_architecture.html" title="ARM architecture">ARM</a> processor core. A small family of derivatives with integrated hi-speed serial ports (68302 and 68360) was used in many communication products from Cisco, 3com, Ascend, Marconi and others. The Motorola 68000 is also used in <a href="/wiki/Texas_Instruments.html" title="Texas Instruments">Texas Instruments</a>' latest line of graphing calculators and in <a href="/wiki/AlphaSmart.html" title="AlphaSmart">AlphaSmart</a>'s Dana portable electronic typewriters.</p>
<p>Motorola ceased production of the original <a href="/wiki/NMOS_logic.html" title="NMOS logic">NMOS</a> 68000 in <a href="/wiki/2000.html" title="2000">2000</a>, although derivatives continue in production, such as the 68HC000 (a pin compatible, HCMOS version of 68000), the 680x0 family and the CPU32 family. <a href="/wiki/As_of_2001.html" title="As of 2001">As of 2001</a>, <a href="/wiki/Hitachi%2C_Ltd..html" title="Hitachi, Ltd.">Hitachi</a> continued to manufacture the 68000 under license.</p>

<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Address bus">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Address_bus" id="Address_bus"></a></p>
<h3>Address bus</h3>
<p>The 68000 was a clever compromise. When the 68000 was introduced, 16-bit buses were really the most practical size. However, the 68000 was designed with 32-bit registers and address spaces, on the assumption that hardware prices would fall.</p>
<p>It is important to note that even though the 68000 had 16-bit ALUs, addresses were always stored as 32-bit quantities, i.e. it had a flat 32-bit <a href="/wiki/Address_space.html" title="Address space">address space</a>. This meant that the 68000 was, and is, a 32-bit microprocessor. Contrast this to the <a href="/wiki/8086.html" title="8086">8086</a>, which had 20-bit address space, but could only access 16-bit (64 kilobyte) chunks without manipulating segment registers. The 68000 achieved this functionality using three 16-bit ALUs. In normal operation, two 16-bit ALUs are chained together to perform an address operation, while the third executes the 16-bit arithmetic. For example, a 32-bit address register postincrement on a 16-bit ADD.W (A<i>n</i>)+,D<i>n</i> runs without speed penalty.</p>
<p>The original 68000 was internally a 16-bit part, but it was executing and existing within the parameters of a 32-bit ISA, as its instruction set describes a 32-bit <a href="/wiki/Architecture.html" title="Architecture">architecture</a>. The importance of architecture cannot be emphasized enough. Throughout history, addressing pains have not been hardware implementation problems, but always architectural problems (instruction set problems, i.e. software compatibility problems). The successor <a href="/wiki/68020.html" title="68020">68020</a> with 32-bit ALU and 32-bit databus runs unchanged 68000 software at "32-bit speed", manipulating data up to 4 gigabytes, far beyond what software of other "16-bit" CPUs (for example, the 8086) could do. Contrast this with the problems posed by segmented architectures such as the 80286 which eventually had to be emulated entirely in software. It is seen as an act of great foresight for the 68000 series to have been 32-bit from the beginning.</p>
<p>However, forwards-incompatible software sometimes resulted from programmers storing data in the address bits (24 through 31) that weren't implemented on the bus. When such code was executed on a machine with a wider <a href="/wiki/Address_bus.html" title="Address bus">address bus</a>, <a href="/wiki/Bus_error.html" title="Bus error">bus errors</a> resulted. Software upgrades were required before <a href="/wiki/Apple_Macintosh.html" title="Apple Macintosh">Macintosh</a> computers could use over 8MB RAM. This software usually remained backwards compatible. (Many applications were written with more foresight, and never had such problems.)</p>
<p>The 68000 required word and longword data items to be aligned to an even byte boundary. An attempt to access them at an odd address caused an exception. This restriction was lifted in the 32-bit <a href="/wiki/Motorola_68020.html" title="Motorola 68020">68020</a>, although a performance penalty was still inflicted.</p>
<p>To address the perceived markets, two M68000 variants were designed. The original MC68000 had a 24-bit address, and a 16-bit <a href="/wiki/Data_bus.html" title="Data bus">data bus</a>. The short form, the <a href="/wiki/68008.html" title="68008">MC68008</a> (as used in the <a href="/wiki/Sinclair_QL.html" title="Sinclair QL">Sinclair QL</a>), had a 20-bit address (20-bit in the <a href="/wiki/DIP.html" title="DIP">DIP</a>/48-pin version and 22-bit in the <a href="/wiki/PLCC.html" title="PLCC">PLCC</a>/52-pin version, introduced later), and an 8-bit data bus.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Internal registers">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Internal_registers" id="Internal_registers"></a></p>
<h3>Internal registers</h3>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Central_processing_unit.html" title="Central processing unit">CPU</a> had eight 32-bit general-purpose data <a href="/wiki/Processor_register.html" title="Processor register">registers</a> (D0-D7), and eight address registers (A0-A7). The last address register was also the standard <a href="/wiki/Stack_%28data_structure%29.html" title="Stack (data structure)">stack pointer</a>, and could be called either A7 or SP. This was a good number of registers in many ways. It was small enough to allow the 68000 to respond quickly to <a href="/wiki/Interrupt.html" title="Interrupt">interrupts</a> (because only 15 or 16 had to be saved), and yet large enough to make most calculations fast.</p>
<p>Having two types of registers was mildly annoying at times, but not hard to use in practice. Reportedly, it allowed the CPU designers to achieve a higher degree of parallelism, by using an auxiliary <a href="/wiki/Execution_unit.html" title="Execution unit">execution unit</a> for the address registers.</p>
<p>Integer representation in the 68000 family is <a href="/wiki/Endianness.html" title="Endianness">big-endian</a>.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Status register">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Status_register" id="Status_register"></a></p>
<h3>Status register</h3>
<p>The 68000 comparison, arithmetic and logic operations set bits in a status register to record their results for use by later conditional jumps. The bits were "Z"ero, "C"arry, o"V"erflow, e"X"tend, and "N"egative. The e"X"tend bit deserves special mention, because it was separated from the Carry. This permitted the extra bit from arithmetic, logic and shift operations to be separated from the carry for flow-of-control and linkage.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: The instruction set">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="The_instruction_set" id="The_instruction_set"></a></p>
<h3>The instruction set</h3>
<p>The designers attempted to make the assembly language <a href="/wiki/Orthogonality#Computer_science.html" title="Orthogonality">orthogonal</a>. That is, instructions were divided into operations and <a href="/wiki/Addressing_mode.html" title="Addressing mode">address modes</a>, and almost all address modes were available for almost all instructions. Many programmers disliked the "near" orthogonality, while others were grateful for the attempt.</p>
<p>At the bit level, the person writing the <a href="/wiki/Assembler.html" title="Assembler">assembler</a> would clearly see that these "instructions" could become any of several different op-codes. It was quite a good compromise because it gave almost the same convenience as a truly orthogonal machine, and yet also gave the CPU designers freedom to fill in the op-code table.</p>
<p>The minimal instruction size was huge for its day at 16 bits. Furthermore, many instructions and addressing modes added extra words on the back for addresses, more address-mode bits, etc.</p>
<p>Many designers believed that the MC68000 architecture had compact code for its cost, especially when produced by compilers. This belief in more compact code led to many of its design wins, and much of its longevity as an architecture.</p>
<p>This belief (or feature, depending on the designer) continued to make design wins for the instruction set (with updated CPUs) up until the <a href="/wiki/ARM_architecture.html" title="ARM architecture">ARM architecture</a> introduced the Thumb instruction set that was similarly compact.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Privilege levels">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Privilege_levels" id="Privilege_levels"></a></p>
<h3>Privilege levels</h3>
<p>The CPU, and later the whole family, implemented exactly two levels of privilege. User mode gave access to everything except the interrupt level control. Supervisor privilege gave access to everything. An interrupt always became supervisory. The supervisor bit was stored in the status register, and visible to user programs.</p>
<p>A real advantage of this system was that the supervisor level had a separate stack pointer. This permitted a <a href="/wiki/Computer_multitasking.html" title="Computer multitasking">multitasking</a> system to use very small stacks for tasks, because the designers did not have to allocate the memory required to hold the stack frames of a maximum stack-up of interrupts.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Interrupts">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Interrupts" id="Interrupts"></a></p>
<h3>Interrupts</h3>
<p>The CPU recognized 7 <a href="/wiki/Interrupt.html" title="Interrupt">interrupt</a> levels. Levels 1 through 7 were strictly prioritized. That is, a higher-numbered interrupt could always interrupt a lower-numbered interrupt. In the status register, a privileged instruction allowed one to set the current minimum interrupt level, blocking lower priority interrupts. Level 7 was not maskable - in other words, an <a href="/wiki/Non-Maskable_interrupt.html" title="Non-Maskable interrupt">NMI</a>. Level 1 could be interrupted by any higher level. Level 0 means no interrupt. The level was stored in the status register, and was visible to user-level programs.</p>
<p>Hardware interrupts are signalled to the CPU using three inputs that encode the highest pending interrupt priority. A separate interrupt controller is usually required to encode the interrupts, though for systems that do not require more than three hardware interrupts it is possible to connect the interrupt signals directly to the encoded inputs at the cost of additional software complexity. The interrupt controller can be as simple as a <a href="/wiki/7400_series.html" title="7400 series">74LS148 priority encoder</a>, or may be part of a VLSI peripheral chip such as the <a  class="new" title="MC68901 Multi-Function Peripheral">MC68901 Multi-Function Peripheral</a>, which also provided a <a href="/wiki/UART.html" title="UART">UART</a>, timer, and parallel I/O.</p>
<p>The "exception table" (interrupt vector addresses) was fixed at addresses 0 through 1023, permitting 256 32-bit vectors. The first vector was the starting stack address, and the second was the starting code address. Vectors 3 through 15 were used to report various errors: bus error, address error, illegal instruction, zero division, CHK &amp; CHK2 vector, privilege violation, and some reserved vectors that became line 1010 emulator, line 1111 emulator, and hardware breakpoint. Vector 24 started the <b>real</b> interrupts: spurious interrupt (no hardware acknowledgement), and level 1 through level 7 autovectors, then the 15 TRAP vectors, then some more reserved vectors, then the user defined vectors.</p>
<p>Since at a minimum the starting code address vector must always be valid on reset, systems commonly included some nonvolatile memory (e.g. <a href="/wiki/Read-only_memory.html" title="Read-only memory">ROM</a>) starting at address zero to contain the vectors and <a href="/wiki/Bootstrap.html" title="Bootstrap">bootstrap</a> code. However, for a general purpose system it is desirable for the operating system to be able to change the vectors at runtime. This was often accomplished by either pointing the vectors in ROM to a jump table in <a href="/wiki/Random_Access_Memory.html" title="Random Access Memory">RAM</a>, or through use of bank-switching to allow the ROM to be replaced by RAM at runtime.</p>
<p>The 68000 did not meet the <a href="/wiki/Popek_and_Goldberg_virtualization_requirements.html" title="Popek and Goldberg virtualization requirements">Popek and Goldberg virtualization requirements</a> for full processor virtualization because it had a single unprivileged instruction "MOVE from SR", which allowed user-mode software read-only access to a small amount of privileged state.</p>
<p>The 68000 was also unable to easily support <a href="/wiki/Virtual_memory.html" title="Virtual memory">virtual memory</a>, which requires the ability to trap and recover from a failed memory access. The 68000 does provide a bus error exception which can be used to trap, but it does not save enough processor state to resume the faulted instruction once the operating system has handled the exception. Several companies did succeed in making 68000 based Unix workstations with virtual memory that worked, by using two 68000 chips running in parallel on different phased clocks. When the "leading" 68000 encountered a bad memory access, extra hardware would interrupt the "main" 68000 to prevent it from also encountering the bad memory access. This interrupt routine would handle the virtual memory functions and restart the "leading" 68000 in the correct state to continue properly synchronized operation when the "main" 68000 returned from the interrupt.</p>
<p>These problems were fixed in the next major revision of the 68K architecture, with the release of the MC68010. The Bus Error and Address Error exceptions pushed a large amount of internal state onto the supervisor stack in order to facilitate recovery, and the MOVE from SR instruction was made privileged. A new unprivileged "MOVE from CCR" instruction was provided for use in its place by user mode software; an operating system could trap and emulate user-mode MOVE from SR instructions if desired.</p>

<p><a name="Instruction_set_details" id="Instruction_set_details"></a></p>
<h2>Instruction set details</h2>
<p>The standard <a href="/wiki/Addressing_mode.html" title="Addressing mode">addressing modes</a> are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Register direct
<ul>
<li>data register, e.g. "D0"</li>
<li>address register, e.g. "A6"</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Register indirect
<ul>
<li>Simple address, e.g. (A0)</li>
<li>Address with post-increment, e.g. (A0)+</li>
<li>Address with pre-decrement, e.g. -(A0)</li>
<li>Address with a 16-bit signed offset, e.g. 16(A0)</li>
<li>Note that the actual increment or decrement size was dependent on the operand request: a byte read instruction incremented the address register by 1, a word read by 2, and a long read by 4.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Register indirect with an Index
<ul>
<li>8-bit signed offset, e.g. 8(A0, D0) or 8(A0, A1)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>PC (program counter) relative with displacement
<ul>
<li>16-bit signed offset, e.g. 16(PC). This mode was very useful.</li>
<li>8-bit signed offset with index, e.g. 8(PC, D2)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Absolute memory location
<ul>
<li>Either a number, e.g. "$4000", or a symbolic name translated by the assembler</li>
<li>Most 68000 assemblers used the "$" symbol for <a href="/wiki/Hexadecimal.html" title="Hexadecimal">hexadecimal</a>, instead of "0x".</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Immediate mode
<ul>
<li>Stored in the instruction, e.g. "#400".</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Plus: access to the <a href="/wiki/Status_register.html" title="Status register">status register</a>, and, in later models, other special registers.</p>
<p>Most instructions had dot-letter suffixes, permitting operations to occur on 8-bit bytes (".b"), 16-bit words (".w"), and 32-bit longs (".l").</p>
<p>Most instructions are <b><a href="/wiki/Dyadic.html" title="Dyadic">dyadic</a></b>, that is, the operation has a source, and a destination, and the destination is changed. Notable instructions were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Arithmetic: ADD, SUB, MULU (unsigned multiply), MULS (signed multiply), DIVU, DIVS, NEG (additive negation), and CMP (a sort of subtract that set the status bits, but did not store the result)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><a href="/wiki/Binary_Coded_Decimal.html" title="Binary Coded Decimal">Binary Coded Decimal</a> Arithmetic: ABCD, and SBCD</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Logic: EOR (exclusive or), AND, NOT (logical not)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Shifting: (logical, i.e. right shifts put zero in the most significant bit) LSL, LSR, (<a href="/wiki/Arithmetic_shift.html" title="Arithmetic shift">arithmetic shifts</a>, i.e. sign-extend the most significant bit) ASR, ASL, (Rotates through eXtend and not:) ROXL, ROXR, ROL, ROR</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><a href="/wiki/Bit_manipulation.html" title="Bit manipulation">Bit manipulation</a> in memory: BSET (to 1), BCLR (to 0), and BTST (set the Zero bit)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><a href="/wiki/Multiprocessing.html" title="Multiprocessing">Multiprocessing</a> control: TAS, <a href="/wiki/Test-and-set.html" title="Test-and-set">test-and-set</a>, performed an indivisible bus operation, permitting <a href="/wiki/Semaphore_%28programming%29.html" title="Semaphore (programming)">semaphores</a> to be used to synchronize several processors sharing a single memory</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Flow of control: JMP (jump), JSR (jump to subroutine), BSR (relative address jump to subroutine), RTS (return from <a href="/wiki/Subroutine.html" title="Subroutine">subroutine</a>), RTE (return from <a href="/wiki/Exception.html" title="Exception">exception</a>, i.e. an interrupt), TRAP (trigger a software exception similar to software interrupt), CHK (a conditional software exception)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Branch: Bcc (a branch where the "cc" specified one of 16 tests of the condition codes in the status register: equal, greater than, less-than, carry, and most combinations and logical inversions, available from the status register).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Decrement-and-branch: DBcc (where "cc" was as for the branch instructions) which decremented a D-register and branched to a destination provided the condition was still true <i>and</i> the register had not been decremented to -1. This use of -1 instead of 0 as the terminating value allowed the easy coding of loops which had to do nothing if the count was 0 to begin with, without the need for an additional check before entering the loop.</li>
