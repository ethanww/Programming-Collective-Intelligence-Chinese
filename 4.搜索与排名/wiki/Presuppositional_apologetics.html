			<p><b>Presuppositional apologetics</b> is a school of <a href="/wiki/Christian_apologetics.html" title="Christian apologetics">Christian apologetics</a>, a field of <a href="/wiki/Christian_theology.html" title="Christian theology">Christian theology</a> that attempts to (1) present a <a href="/wiki/Reason.html" title="Reason">rational</a> basis for the Christian faith, (2) defend the faith against objections, and (3) attack the perceived flaws of other <a href="/wiki/Worldview.html" title="Worldview">worldviews</a>. Presuppositional apologetics is especially concerned with the third aspect of this discipline, though it generally sees the trifold distinction as a difference in emphasis rather than as delineating three separate endeavors. Presuppositional apologetics developed in and is most commonly advocated within <a href="/wiki/Reformed.html" title="Reformed">Reformed</a> circles of Christianity.</p>
<p>The key discriminator of this school is that it maintains that the Christian apologist must assume the truth of the supernatural <a href="/wiki/Revelation.html" title="Revelation">revelation</a> contained in the <a href="/wiki/Bible.html" title="Bible">Bible</a> (that is, the Christian worldview) because there can be no set of neutral assumptions from which to reason with a non-Christian, and apart from such "presuppositions" one could not make sense of any human experience. In other words, presuppositionalists say that a Christian cannot consistently declare his belief in the <i>necessary</i> <a href="/wiki/Existence.html" title="Existence">existence</a> of the <a href="/wiki/God.html" title="God">God</a> of the Bible and simultaneously argue on the basis of a different set of assumptions (presumably those of the non-Christian) in which God may or may not exist, and which leave human experience unintelligible.</p>
<p>Presuppositionalists contrast their approach with the other schools of Christian apologetics by describing them as assuming the world is intelligible apart from belief in the existence of God and then arguing exclusively on (purportedly) neutral grounds to support trusting the Christian <a href="/wiki/Scripture.html" title="Scripture">Scriptures</a>. Specifically, presuppositionalists describe <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Aquinas.html" title="Thomas Aquinas">Thomistic</a> (also "Traditional" or "Classical") apologetics as concentrating on the first aspect of apologetics with its <a href="/wiki/Logical_argument.html" title="Logical argument">logical proofs</a> for the existence of God. Aquinas himself insists that many crucial truths can only be known through scripture, and none of his arguments are intended to show the entire Christian picture; presuppositionalists criticize this "block house" method for failing to start at the level of the controlling beliefs of worldviews and implicitly allowing non-Christian assumptions from the start. Their goal is to argue that nonbelievers' assumptions require believing in some things about God, man and the world which nonbelievers claim they don't believe.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Evidentialism.html" title="Evidentialism">Evidentialist</a> apologetics, on the other hand, focuses especially on the first two aspects of the discipline by offering various <a href="/wiki/Archaeology.html" title="Archaeology">archaeological</a>, <a href="/wiki/History.html" title="History">historical</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Science.html" title="Science">scientific</a> <a href="/wiki/Evidence.html" title="Evidence">evidence</a> to support both the <a href="/wiki/Probability.html" title="Probability">probable</a> existence of God and the truth of the Bible, and refute the major objections to the same. While presuppositionalists don't believe that classical arguments are good enough on the grounds that they don't show enough about God, they also think evidentialists simply haven't given a strong enough demonstration, and have started out by granting the assumption that human experience is intelligible without appeal to Scripture, thereby defeating their own cause. Evidentialists demur from this assessment, claiming that presuppositionalism amounts to <a href="/wiki/Fideism.html" title="Fideism">fideism</a>. The evidentialist's conclusion is that the Bible is most probably accurate about what it reports, and thus the whole of Biblical revelation follows.</p>

<h2>History of presuppositional apologetics</h2>
<p>The origins of presuppositional apologetics are in the work of <a href="/wiki/Netherlands.html" title="Netherlands">Dutch</a> theologian <a href="/wiki/Cornelius_Van_Til.html" title="Cornelius Van Til">Cornelius Van Til</a>, a member of the <a href="/wiki/Orthodox_Presbyterian_Church.html" title="Orthodox Presbyterian Church">Orthodox Presbyterian Church</a>, who began to adopt a presuppositional approach to defending the truth of his faith as early as the late 1920s.<sup><a  title="">1</a></sup> Van Til personally disliked the term "presuppositional", as he felt it misrepresented his approach to apologetics, which he felt was focused primarily on the preeminence of the Bible as the criterion for truth. He did, however, accept the label reluctantly, given that it was a useful way of distinguishing between those who deny a neutral basis for apologetics and those who do not. His student, <a href="/wiki/Greg_Bahnsen.html" title="Greg Bahnsen">Greg Bahnsen</a>, aided in some of the later developments of Van Tillian Presuppositionalism, and the Bahnsen Theological Seminary continues to promote presuppositional apologetics in its curriculum. <a href="/wiki/John_Frame.html" title="John Frame">John Frame</a>, another student of Van Til, also continues to advocate a presuppositional approach, although he is generally more critical of Van Til's thought than Bahnsen was.<sup><a  title="">2</a></sup></p>
<p>By 1952, presuppositional apologetics had acquired a new advocate in the <a href="/wiki/Presbyterian.html" title="Presbyterian">Presbyterian</a> theologian <a href="/wiki/Gordon_Clark.html" title="Gordon Clark">Gordon Clark</a>.<sup><a  title="">3</a></sup> He embraced the label "presuppositional" since his approach to apologetics, following his <a href="/wiki/Plato.html" title="Plato">Platonic</a> <a href="/wiki/Epistemology.html" title="Epistemology">epistemology</a>, was more closely concerned with the logical order of assumptions than was Van Til. The differences between the two views on presuppositionalism, though few in number, caused a significant rift between the two men, and even after both Clark and Van Til had died, John Robbins (a theologian and former student of Clark's) and Bahnsen feuded often and publicly.<sup><a  title="">4</a></sup></p>
<p><a href="/wiki/As_of_2005.html" title="As of 2005">As of 2005</a>, presuppositional apologetics has established itself securely as a legitimate perspective on apologetics, although its appeal remains largely limited to Christians whose theology is <a href="/wiki/Calvinist.html" title="Calvinist">Calvinist</a> in origin. In a recent book outlining the major schools of apologetics, the presuppositional approach was given equal time alongside much older and well-established schools of thought (the "classical" and "evidential" noted above, for example).<sup><a  title="">5</a></sup> In general, Van Til's approach is far more popular and widespread than Clark's.</p>

Cornelius Van Til</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Apologists who follow Van Til earned the label "presuppositional" because of their central tenet that the Christian must at all times presuppose (that is, assume from the beginning) the supernatural revelation of the Bible as the ultimate arbiter of truth and error in order to know anything. Christians, they say, can assume nothing less because all human thought presupposes (that is, requires by prerequisite) the existence of the God of the Bible. They claim that by accepting the assumptions of non-Christians, which fundamentally deny the <a href="/wiki/Trinity.html" title="Trinity">Trinitarian</a> God of the Bible, one could not even formulate an intelligible argument. Though Van Tillians do, at one point, "put themselves in the shoes" of the opponent, "for the sake of argument", to demonstrate where that position would lead, they claim that they can only do so because this is actually God's world, and man is actually God's creature, made in God's own image, and as such can never completely shut God out (in living or thinking) -- hence there is always a common basis for dialogue, even though it is a basis which the opponent is not usually willing to acknowledge.</p>
<p>According to Frame, "[Van Til's] major complaints against competing apologetic methods are theological complaints, that is, that they compromise the incomprehensibility of God, <a href="/wiki/Total_depravity.html" title="Total depravity">total depravity</a>, the clarity of natural revelation, God's comprehensive control over <a href="/wiki/Creation_%28theology%29.html" title="Creation (theology)">creation</a>, and so on."<sup><a  title="">6</a></sup> Within their presuppositionalist framework, Van Tillians do often utilize foundational concepts for Thomistic and Evidentialist arguments (belief in the uniformity of natural causes, for example), but they are unwilling to grant that such beliefs are justifiable on "natural" (neutral) grounds. Rather, Van Tillians employ these beliefs, which they justify on Biblical grounds, in the service of <i><a href="/wiki/Transcendence_%28philosophy%29.html" title="Transcendence (philosophy)">transcendental</a> arguments</i>, which are a sort of meta-argument about foundational principles in which the non-Christian's worldview is shown to be incoherent in and of itself and intelligible only because it borrows capital from the Christian worldview. Van Til summarized the transcendental method thus: "(T)he only proof for the existence of God is that without God you couldn't prove anything." An example of this form of argumentation is found in the <a href="/wiki/Transcendental_argument_for_the_existence_of_God.html" title="Transcendental argument for the existence of God">transcendental argument for the existence of God</a>.</p>
<p>Van Tillians also stress the importance of reckoning with "the noetic effects of sin" (that is, the effects of sin on the mind), which, they maintain, corrupt man's ability to understand God, the world, and himself aright. In their view, as a fallen creature, man does know the truth in each of these areas, but he seeks to find a different interpretation -- one in which, as <a href="/wiki/C._S._Lewis.html" title="C. S. Lewis">C. S. Lewis</a> said, he is "on the bench" and God is "in the dock." The primary job of the apologist is, therefore, simply to confront the unbeliever with the fact that, while he is verbally denying the truth, he is nonetheless practically behaving in accord with it. (Van Til illustrated this alleged inconsistency as a child, elevated on the father's knee, reaching up to slap his face, and Bahnsen used the analogy of a man breathing out air to make the argument that air doesn't exist.)</p>
<p>Another important aspect of the Van Tillian apologetical program is the distinction between <i>proof</i> and <i>persuasion</i>. According to the first chapter of the <a href="/wiki/Epistle_to_the_Romans.html" title="Epistle to the Romans">Epistle to the Romans</a>, man has ample proof in all of creation of God's existence and attributes but chooses to suppress it. Van Til likewise claimed that there are valid arguments to prove that the God of the Bible exists but that the unbeliever would not necessarily be persuaded by them because of his suppression of the truth, and therefore the apologist, he said, must present the truth regardless of whether anyone is actually persuaded by it. (Frame notes that the apologist is here akin to the psychiatrist who presents the truth about the paranoid's delusions, trusting that his patient knows the truth at some level and can accept it—though Frame would say the action of God in the <a href="/wiki/Holy_Spirit.html" title="Holy Spirit">Holy Spirit</a> is also required for the unbeliever to accept ultimate truths.) An implication of this position is that all arguments are "person relative" in the sense that one non-Christian might be persuaded by a particular argument and another might not be, depending on their background and experiences.</p>

Gordon Clark</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><a href="/wiki/Gordon_Clark.html" title="Gordon Clark">Gordon Clark</a> and his followers treat the truth of the Scriptures as the <a href="/wiki/Axiom.html" title="Axiom">axiom</a> of their system. The axiom cannot be proven or disproven; rather, the worldview that results from the axiom may be tested for consistency and comprehensiveness. Testing for internal contradiction exemplifies Clark's strict reliance on the <a href="/wiki/Laws_of_logic.html" title="Laws of logic">laws of logic</a>. (He famously translates the first verse of the Gospel of John as "In the beginning was the Logic, and the Logic was with God, and the Logic was God." By contrast, some Van Tillians have suggested that God might be "above the laws of logic" in some sense.) Thus, in order to invalidate non-Christian worldviews, one must simply show how a different presupposition results in necessary logical contradictions.</p>
<p>However, Clark stated, that there could be more than one apparently coherent worldview and that one could not test all the implications of any worldview without omniscience. Nonetheless, he believed that this method was effective in many practical cases (when arguing against, for instance, <a href="/wiki/Secular_Humanism.html" title="Secular Humanism">secular humanism</a> or <a href="/wiki/Dialectical_materialism.html" title="Dialectical materialism">dialectical materialism</a>) and that, in the end, each of us must simply choose (that is, make an informed selection) from among seemingly consistent worldviews the one that most adequately answers life's questions and seems the most internally coherent. (Some Van Tillian critics suggest that the concept of coherence itself must be defined in terms of Christian presuppositions but is instead being used by Clark as a "neutral" principle for discerning the truth of any proposition.)</p>
<p>Using this approach, Clark labored to expose the contradictions of many worldviews that were in vogue in his day and to defend the Christian worldview by proving its consistency over against those who attacked it. His unflagging use of logic sometimes led him to what most Reformed theologians consider rather unorthodox ideas on such topics as the <a href="/wiki/Problem_of_evil.html" title="Problem of evil">problem of evil</a> -- topics which are most often treated by theologians as paradoxes or apparent contradictions not resolvable by human logic. But Clark famously rejected the idea that Scripture teaches paradoxes, and with the notion of "apparent contradiction", asked "apparent to whom?". He described an alleged biblical paradox as nothing more than "a charley-horse between the ears that can be eliminated by rational massage."<a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.trinityfoundation.org/journal.php?id=76">[1]</a></p>
<p>With regard to other schools of apologetics, Clark suggested that the <a href="/wiki/Cosmological_argument.html" title="Cosmological argument">cosmological argument</a> was not just unpersuasive but also logically invalid (because it <a href="/wiki/Begging_the_question.html" title="Begging the question">begged the question</a>), and he similarly dismissed the other Thomistic arguments. As a staunch critic of <a href="/wiki/Empiricism.html" title="Empiricism">empiricism</a>, he did not tend to make much use of evidential arguments, which yield likelihoods and probabilities rather than logical certainties (that is, either coherence or incoherence).</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Circularity">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Circularity" id="Circularity"></a></p>
<h2>Circularity</h2>
<p>The chief criticism of presuppositionalism is that it uses <a href="/wiki/Begging_the_question.html" title="Begging the question">circular</a> reasoning, which is generally considered a <a href="/wiki/Logical_fallacy.html" title="Logical fallacy">logical fallacy</a>. Many opponents of presuppositional apologetics would characterize the presuppositional argument as resting on a belief in the Bible as the source of truth because it is <a href="/wiki/Biblical_inspiration.html" title="Biblical inspiration">inspired</a> by God, in whom we can believe because the Bible affirms it and the Bible is the source of truth. While some logicians accept <a href="/wiki/Tautology.html" title="Tautology">tautology</a> as a legitimate form of argument, most find it impossible to counter, since each premise is only acceptable if the other premise is also found acceptable. This charge seeks to subsume presuppositionalism within <a href="/wiki/Fideism.html" title="Fideism">fideism</a>, which holds that belief in God cannot be justified by reason at all, but must be accepted or rejected wholly upon faith.</p>
<p>Van Tillians do not deny the charge of circularity. Rather, they insist that all worldviews are ultimately circular and cannot justify their foundational principle except by that principle itself. Therefore, while presuppositionalists agree that circularity makes for an invalid argument in some circumstances, they contend that in the case of ultimate presuppositions, there is no other option. So when considering worldviews, the concern must not be for vicious (or "small") circularity, but for internal coherence ("large circularity"). In other words, presuppositionalists believe that the question to be asked is not, "Do I begin with my ultimate presupposition?" but rather, "Do my beliefs and practices comport with my ultimate presupposition?"</p>
<p>If this reasoning is true, however, it means that all argumentation is ultimately circular. This assertion makes many critics question the line of reasoning proposed by presuppositional apologists. In allowing for the validity of circular arguments by calling all arguments circular, presuppositionalists seem to have denied the validity of all arguments.</p>
<p>Van Tillians insist that the alleged fact of ultimate <a href="/wiki/Epistemology.html" title="Epistemology">epistemological</a> circularity does not mean that the apologetical endeavor is reduced to a <a href="/wiki/Philosophy.html" title="Philosophy">philosophical</a> "standoff," where one simply chooses a set of presuppositions by a voluntary act (<a href="/wiki/Fideism.html" title="Fideism">fideism</a>) and then uncritically holds on to them despite all arguments to the contrary or in lieu of any in favor. They endorse an approach that looks for internal consistency of a system wherein the initial premise (the existence of the Biblical God) is also the culmination of all knowledge. To extend an analogy of Van Til, if one starts with the belief in the existence of the Sun, and then all of the tests one can perform because of the light of the Sun confirm the initial belief, then the belief is sound. This is not <a href="/wiki/Vicious_circle.html" title="Vicious circle">vicious circularity</a> as demonstrated in the inference pattern "A because B, B because A". So, they claim, even though all arguments may be considered to be circular in one sense, not all are circular in the same sense, and not every sense involves logically fallacious reasoning.</p>
<p>Clarkians, on the other hand, believe that <i>all</i> philosophical systems start with <a href="/wiki/Axiom.html" title="Axiom">axioms</a>, which by definition are not capable of proof. Clarkians choose the propositions of Scripture as their axioms. Circular reasoning (of the fallacious sort) involves trying to prove premises from their conclusions, while axioms are not to be proved at all. Clarkians claim to deduce <a href="/wiki/Theorem.html" title="Theorem">theorems</a> from the axioms of Scripture.</p>
<p>Presuppositionalists posit that there is a logical necessity that attaches to a certain set of presuppositions (the ultimate of which being the existence of the God revealed in the Bible) and that one simply cannot reject that set of presuppositions without destroying the very foundations of knowledge, science, and ethics. That is to say, presuppositionalists argue that without the Christian-Theistic circle, human experience would be unintelligible, and the very objection to "circular reasoning" would be nothing more than a random, disconnected, and ultimately meaningless utterance, not in principle different from any other utterance. Like the man in Bahnsen's analogy who breathes out air to make the argument against the existence of air, by raising the "circular reasoning" objection the unbeliever is thereby demonstrating the truth of Christian Theism, according to presuppositionalists.</p>
<p>It should not be thought, however, that all presuppositionalists repudiate empirical or rational evidences in favor of heavily philosophical argumentation about the nature of conceptual schemes, the nature of arguments and the like. Van Tillians in particular utilize evidence from many other disciplines (physical sciences, archaeology, philosophy, etc.) -- as understood according to the Christian presuppositions -- to argue in even "broader circles," seeking to demonstrate that all the universe, when understood correctly, plainly declares the wonders of the Creator.</p>
