<b>Systems Engineering</b> (SE) is an <a href="/wiki/Interdisciplinary.html" title="Interdisciplinary">interdisciplinary</a> approach and means for enabling the realization and deployment of successful <a href="/wiki/System.html" title="System">systems</a>. It can be viewed as the application of engineering techniques to the engineering of systems, as well as the application of a systems approach to engineering efforts.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a  title="">[1]</a></sup> What makes SE unique, especially in contrast with traditional engineering disciplines, is that SE does not build tangible products. Whereas <a href="/wiki/Civil_Engineering.html" title="Civil Engineering">civil engineers</a> might design buildings and <a href="/wiki/Electrical_engineering.html" title="Electrical engineering">electrical engineers</a> might design circuits, systems engineers deal with abstract systems, and rely on other engineering disciplines to design and deliver the tangible products that is the realization of those systems<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a  title="">[2]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The systems engineering effort spans the whole <a href="/wiki/System_lifecycle.html" title="System lifecycle">system lifecycle</a>. SE focuses on defining customer needs and required functionality early in the development cycle, documenting requirements, then proceeding with design synthesis and system validation while considering the complete problem:</p>

<li>Test &amp; Evaluation</li>
<li>System Disposal</li>
</ul>
<p>System development often requires contribution from diverse technical disciplines. Each of these disciplines are normally focused on their own particular contribution to the system (e.g., <a href="/wiki/Jet_engine.html" title="Jet engine">jet engine</a> designers would not be focused on the aircraft's <a href="/wiki/Hydraulic.html" title="Hydraulic">hydraulic</a> subsystem). Systems engineering's vantage point is a <a href="/wiki/Holistic.html" title="Holistic">holistic</a> perspective of the system, and from this perspective integrates all of these technical efforts to ensure that their various subsystems work with one another.</p>
<p>By providing a systems view of the development effort, SE helps meld all the technical contributors into a unified team effort, forming a structured development process that proceeds from concept to production to operation and, in some cases, through to termination and disposal. System Engineering is usually directly responsible for any engineering function that is not deemed sufficiently necessary on a project to require a full-time, specialist engineer, although consultants may be enlisted as needed.</p>
<p>Ideally, Systems Engineering considers both the business and the technical needs of all customers with the goal of providing a quality product that meets the user needs. However, the reality in any very large project is often that <i>user</i> needs exceed what the <i>sponsor</i> is willing to pay for; and the <i>schedule</i> to satisfy those needs generally exceeds what either of them are willing to live with. As a result, 'satisfaction of all technical requirements' is subject to the usual constraints of cost, schedule, and <a href="/wiki/Producibility.html" title="Producibility">producibility</a>.</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The systems engineering role may have originated as the lead or project engineer who was assigned principal responsibility for orchestrating these large and complex engineering programs, and/or as the single point of reference responsible for the entire engineering activity preferred by the United States Government on its large programs (especially to be responsible for the huge amount of extra documentation required of Government programs)<sup title="The text in the vicinity of this tag needs citation." class="noprint">[<a  title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><i>citation&#160;needed</i></a>]</sup>. However, systems engineering became synonymous with the overarching responsibility for development of the complete end product (hardware, software, services) and enabling products (e.g., the 'systems' that produce and test the target system). This role has increasingly expanded, until the present, when it is also (primarily) responsible for the interface between the complete device and the user, and even with the systems eventual disposal. While <a href="/wiki/Hardware_architect.html" title="Hardware architect">hardware engineering</a> typically deals with just hardware and <a href="/wiki/Software_engineering.html" title="Software engineering">software engineering</a> with just <a href="/wiki/Software_program.html" title="Software program">software</a>, the systems engineer is responsible for seeing that the software properly operates on the hardware, and that the system composed of the two entities is capable of properly interacting with its external environment, especially the user, while performing its intended function. As a general proposition, the systems engineer is especially concerned with the engineering '<a href="/wiki/Ilities.html" title="Ilities">ilities</a>.'<sup title="The text in the vicinity of this tag needs citation." class="noprint">[<a  title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><i>citation&#160;needed</i></a>]</sup></p>
<p>Taking an <a href="/wiki/Interdisciplinary.html" title="Interdisciplinary">interdisciplinary</a> approach to engineering systems is inherently complex, since the <a href="/wiki/Behavior.html" title="Behavior">behavior</a> of and interaction among system components are not always <a href="/wiki/Well_defined.html" title="Well defined">well defined</a> or understood (at least at the outset). Defining and characterizing such <a href="/wiki/Systems.html" title="Systems">systems</a> and subsystems, and the interactions among them, is the primary aim of systems engineering.

The first significant systems engineering was performed for <a href="/wiki/Telephone.html" title="Telephone">telephone</a> systems. All the different parts of the phone system have to interoperate reliably. An excellent overview of the <a href="/wiki/Network_interface.html" title="Network interface">interfaces</a> and <a href="/wiki/Logic.html" title="Logic">logic</a>, with some history, is "Digital Telephony" by <a  class="new" title="John C. Bellamy">John C. Bellamy</a>. For operational telephony terms, see <a  class="new" title="Newton's Telecom Dictionary">Newton's Telecom Dictionary</a>, for example. The field grew around the time of World War II with the development of increasingly complex military systems.</p>
<p>In 1990 a professional society for systems engineering, the <i>National Council on Systems Engineering</i> (NCOSE), was founded by representatives from a number of US corporations and organizations. NCOSE was created to address the need for improvements in systems engineering practices and education. As a result of growing involvement from systems engineers outside of the U.S., the name of the organization was changed to the <i><a href="/wiki/International_Council_on_Systems_Engineering.html" title="International Council on Systems Engineering">International Council on Systems Engineering</a></i> (INCOSE) in 1995.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a  title="">[3]</a></sup></p>

<small>You can <a  title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Fact and Reference Check">help</a> Wikipedia by introducing appropriate citations.</small></div>
<p>In recent times, industry in general has begun to accept that the engineering of systems, both large and small, can lead to unpredictable <a href="/wiki/Behavior.html" title="Behavior">behavior</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Emergence.html" title="Emergence">emergence</a> of unforeseen system characteristics ('emergent properties'). Decisions made at the beginning of a project whose consequences are not clearly understood can have enormous implications later in the life of a system, and it is the task of the modern systems engineer to explore these issues and make critical decisions. There is no method which guarantees that decisions made today will still be valid when a system goes into service years or decades after it is first conceived but there are techniques to support the process of systems engineering. Examples include the use of soft systems methodology, <a href="/wiki/Jay_Wright_Forrester.html" title="Jay Wright Forrester">Jay Wright Forrester</a>'s <a href="/wiki/System_dynamics.html" title="System dynamics">System dynamics</a> method and the <a href="/wiki/Unified_Modeling_Language.html" title="Unified Modeling Language">Unified Modeling Language</a> (UML), each of which are currently being explored, evaluated and developed to support the engineering decision making process.</p>
<p>Systems engineering often involves the modeling or simulation of some aspects of the proposed system in order to validate assumptions or explore theories. For example, highly complex systems such as aircraft are usually modeled and simulated before <a href="/wiki/Flight.html" title="Flight">flight</a>. In this way the initial aeroelastic engineering and <a  class="new" title="Control equations">control equations</a> can be drafted and improved upon before any physical system is ever constructed. Since aircraft are often very expensive, this reduces the expense and difficulty of debugging the controls and reduces the risk of crashing real aircraft. Careful initial testing and flight envelope expansion are typically still required to reach acceptable levels of safety and performance in advanced aircraft.</p>
<p>The role of the system engineer, together with (perhaps) a <a href="/wiki/Safety_engineer.html" title="Safety engineer">safety engineer</a>, is especially important when systems must have especially predictable/reliable <a href="/wiki/Behavior.html" title="Behavior">behavior</a>. For example, power plants (especially nuclear), medical <a href="/wiki/Machinery.html" title="Machinery">machinery</a>, and spacecraft usually consist of many individually engineered and manufactured parts, by different companies. System engineering provides the assurance that normal operations (and even some explicitly <i><b>defined</b> abnormal</i> operations), including parts failures, will not provide a hazard for the user or anyone else in the community. Other high-reliability, <i>potentially</i> hazardous applications are communications systems, or commercial systems, such as <a href="/wiki/Automatic_teller_machine.html" title="Automatic teller machine">ATM machines</a>, where failures can cause serious loss of <a href="/wiki/Property.html" title="Property">property</a> or serious economic or liability exposure. The application of systems engineering processes may also result in significant cost savings, as well as providing a reasonable (up-front) assurance of the eventual success of the project.</p>
<p>Generally, a neat breakdown of roles and responsibilites among the various types of architects and engineers can't be done, as there <i><b>are</b></i> no neat boundaries, but instead a continuous overlap— which is <i>program</i> and <i>people</i> specific. That is, <i>there are</i> <b>no neat</b> <i>boundaries</i> between systems architecture and systems engineering, or between systems engineering and software engineering/architecture (or any of the other "<a href="/wiki/Ilities.html" title="Ilities">ilities</a>"). Only the <i>hardware</i> engineer still maintains a (relatively) neat boundary, but even that may be violated, depending on the people and program<sup title="The text in the vicinity of this tag needs citation." class="noprint">[<a  title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><i>citation&#160;needed</i></a>]</sup>. For example, firmware embedded into a micro-controller is often assigned to the <i>hardware</i> engineer, but it is essentially a software development.</p>
<p>On a <i>huge</i> (generally, government) program, there may be one or more systems architects, systems engineers, software architects (<i>rarely</i>, since the systems architect usually assumes this role), and software engineers<sup title="The text in the vicinity of this tag needs citation." class="noprint">[<a  title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><i>citation&#160;needed</i></a>]</sup>.</p>
<p>In any case, the <i>specific</i> roles and responsibilities <i>must</i> be separately negotiated on each program by the people/engineers involved (hopefully) according to their capabilities and inclinations.</p>
<p>To make things more confusing (perhaps) is that <i>none</i> of these roles are to be considered as <i>supervisory</i> or <i>management</i> roles. Rather, the various roles relate to each other in order of precedence of input to the program requirements/specification. The architect roles precede the engineering roles, and the systems (engineering) role precedes the <i>other</i> engineering roles, in order of input. Any disagreements among the players must be <i>negotiated</i> away. But, generally, on the large programs, there is one <b>Chief Engineer</b> whose word is law (regardless of what discipline s/he comes from)<sup title="The text in the vicinity of this tag needs citation." class="noprint">[<a  title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><i>citation&#160;needed</i></a>]</sup>.</p>

<p>Many related fields may be considered tightly coupled to systems engineering. Many of these areas have contributed to the development of Systems Engineering as a distinct entity.</p>

<h3>Cognitive systems engineering</h3>
<p><a  class="new" title="Cognitive systems engineering">Cognitive systems engineering</a> is Systems Engineering with the human integrated as an explicit part of the system. It depends on the direct application of centuries of experience and research in both Cognitive Psychology and Systems Engineering. Cognitive Systems Engineering focuses on how man interacts with the environment and attempts to design systems that explicitly respect how humans think. Cognitive Systems Engineering works at the intersection of:</p>
<ol>
<li>The problems imposed by the world</li>
<li>The needs of agents (human, hardware, and software)</li>
<li>The interaction among the various systems and technologies that affect (and/or are affected by) the situation.</li>
</ol>
<p>Sometimes referred to as Human Engineering or <a href="/wiki/Human_factors.html" title="Human factors">Human Factors Engineering</a>, this subject also deals with <a href="/wiki/Ergonomics.html" title="Ergonomics">ergonomics</a> in systems design. But Human Engineering is more properly viewed as another engineering specialty that the systems engineer must integrate.</p>

<h3>Control systems design</h3>
<p>The design and implementation of <a href="/wiki/Control_systems.html" title="Control systems">control systems</a>, used extensively in nearly every industry, is a large sub-field of Systems Engineering. The cruise control on an automobile and the guidance system for a ballistic missile are two examples.

<p><a href="/wiki/Interface_design.html" title="Interface design">Interface design</a> and specification are concerned with assuring that the pieces of a system connect and interoperate with other parts of the system and with external systems as necessary. Interface design also includes assuring that system interfaces be able to accept new features, including mechanical, electrical, and logical interfaces, including reserved wires, plug-space, command codes and bits in communication protocols. This is known as <a href="/wiki/Extensibility.html" title="Extensibility">extensibility</a>. <a href="/wiki/Human-Computer_Interaction.html" title="Human-Computer Interaction">Human-Computer Interaction</a> (HCI) is another aspect of interface design, and is a critical aspect of modern Systems Engineering.</p>

<h3>Operations research</h3>
<p><a href="/wiki/Operations_research.html" title="Operations research">Operations research</a>, or OR, is sometimes taught under departments of Industrial Engineering or Applied Mathematics, but the tools of OR are also taught in a Systems Engineering course of study. OR is concerned with the optimization of an arbitrary process under multiple constraints (see articles for discussion:<a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.boston.com/globe/search/stories/reprints/operationeverything062704.html">[1]</a> and <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.sas.com/news/sascom/2004q4/feature_tech.html">[2]</a>).</p>

<h3>Reliability engineering</h3>
<p><a href="/wiki/Reliability_engineering.html" title="Reliability engineering">Reliability engineering</a> is the discipline of ensuring a system will meet the customer's expectations for performance throughout its life. Reliability engineering applies to all aspects of the system. It is closely associated with <a href="/wiki/Maintainability.html" title="Maintainability">maintainability</a>, <a href="/wiki/Availability.html" title="Availability">availability</a> and <a href="/wiki/Logistic_engineering.html" title="Logistic engineering">logistics engineering</a>. Reliability engineering is always a critical component of safety engineering, as in <a href="/wiki/Failure_mode_and_effects_analysis.html" title="Failure mode and effects analysis">failure modes and effects analysis</a> (FMEA) and <a href="/wiki/Fault_tree.html" title="Fault tree">hazard fault tree</a> analysis, and of <a href="/wiki/Security_engineering.html" title="Security engineering">security engineering</a>. Reliability engineering relies heavily on <a href="/wiki/Statistics.html" title="Statistics">statistics</a>, <a href="/wiki/Probability_theory.html" title="Probability theory">probability theory</a> and <a href="/wiki/Reliability_theory.html" title="Reliability theory">reliability theory</a> for its tools and processes.</p>

<h3>Safety engineering</h3>
<p>The techniques of <a href="/wiki/Safety_engineering.html" title="Safety engineering">safety engineering</a> may be applied by non-specialist engineers (e.g., <a href="/wiki/Engineer%27s_degree.html" title="Engineer's degree">EEs</a> or <b>SE</b>s) in designing complex systems to minimize the probability of safety-critical failures. The <b>System Safety Engineering</b> function helps to identify <i><b>safety hazards</b></i> in emerging designs, and may assist with techniques to <i><b>mitigate</b></i> the effects of (potentially) hazardous conditions that cannot be designed out of systems.</p>

<h3>Software engineering</h3>
<p>From its beginnings, <a href="/wiki/Software_engineering.html" title="Software engineering">Software engineering</a> has shaped modern SE practice to a great degree. The techniques used in the handling of complexes of large software-intensive systems has had a major effect on the shaping and reshaping of the tools, methods and processes of SE (e.g., see <a href="/wiki/SysML.html" title="SysML">SysML</a>, <a href="/wiki/CMMI.html" title="CMMI">CMMI</a>, <a href="/wiki/Object-oriented_analysis_and_design.html" title="Object-oriented analysis and design">Object-oriented analysis and design</a>, <a href="/wiki/Requirements_engineering.html" title="Requirements engineering">Requirements engineering</a>, <a href="/wiki/Formal_methods.html" title="Formal methods">Formal methods</a> and <a  class="new" title="Language theory">Language theory</a>).</p>

<h3>Supportability Engineering</h3>
<p>Any system, when operational and providing the requirements defined in the design, needs degrees of support to maintain the operational functions. Supportability engineering is an analytical process that determines the optimal mix and distribution of support resources. By using the reliability aspects of the system and through isolating failure modes, causes and effects, the system's maintainabilty can be designed. A properly designed maintenance plan determines support resource capacities, such as trained support staff, documentation, spare parts, test equipment, repair facilities and contracted support.</p>

<h3>The Successes</h3>
<p>Systems engineering (SE) practices were used during the critical period of ballistic missile development, both at <a href="/wiki/NASA.html" title="NASA">NASA</a> and the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Defense.html" title="United States Department of Defense">United States Department of Defense</a>. The initial U.S. failures of booster programs following <a href="/wiki/Sputnik.html" title="Sputnik">Sputnik</a> were overcome, resulting in the spectacular success of the <a href="/wiki/Project_Apollo.html" title="Project Apollo">Project Apollo</a> moon-landing program. Systems engineering successes in the design and development of the <a href="/wiki/Polaris_ballistic_missile.html" title="Polaris ballistic missile">Polaris ballistic missile</a> system led to unqualified successes of the submarine-based intercontinental ballistic missile systems that have culminated in the <a href="/wiki/Trident_missile.html" title="Trident missile">Trident missile</a> D5 system. Similar successes were realized in the development of land-based missiles and in the development of military and commercial aircraft (e.g., the <a href="/wiki/Boeing_777.html" title="Boeing 777">Boeing 777</a> and the various recent <a href="/wiki/Airbus.html" title="Airbus">Airbuses</a>). In addition, virtually all major weapons systems acquired by the U.S. military since the 1970s have been acquired using system engineering techniques.</p>
<p>Partly as the result of this long history of SE development in the military, military weapons use subsequent to Vietnam have generally proved to be spectacularly successful, with little unexpected failure of (even complex) weapons systems.</p>
<p>In addition, the major advances of the <a href="/wiki/Telecommunications.html" title="Telecommunications">telecommunications</a> industry in recent years were largely made possible using systems engineering techniques, resulting in the successes of the industry as we know it today.</p>
<p>SE has played a major role in producing many recent 'revolutions' in technology development.</p>

<h3>The Failures</h3>
<p><a  class="external text" title="http://necsi.org/projects/yaneer/E3-IEEE_final.pdf">When Systems Engineering Fails — Toward Complex Systems Engineering</a><br />
<i>"The images of success in the Manhattan and Space Projects remain with us. What really happens with large scale engineering projects is much less satisfactory. Many projects end up as failed and abandoned. This is true despite the tremendous investments that [have been] made…"</i></p>
<p>The failure of the <a href="/wiki/Federal_Aviation_Administration.html" title="Federal Aviation Administration">Federal Aviation Administration</a>'s Advanced Automation System has been reasonably well documented. (See above citation.) Indeed, this represented such a complete failure, that the prime contractor sold the entire division hosting the project, over a year prior to the dénouement!</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the failure was not primarily a SE failure. The principal failing was that, for all of the people involved, government and contractor, managers and engineers, the AAS Program represented <i>at least an order of magnitude larger and many magnitudes more complex</i> than any they had ever experienced or even envisioned. And, <i>there were entirely too many players and not enough workers.</i> There are many valuable lessons that could be learned from it, but unlike civil engineers (whose failures usually involve civil liability), SEs rarely get an opportunity to dig deeply into their failures.</p>
<p><a  class="external text" title="http://www.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/A.Finkelstein/las/lascase0.9.pdf">Report of the Inquiry Into <b>The London Ambulance Service</b> (February 1993)</a><br />
<i>"In the autumn of 1990, following the abandonment of the previous attempt to computerise the <b>LAS</b></i> <b>Command and Control</b> <i>system, work commenced on the preparation of a requirements specification which would lead towards the implementation of a 'state of the art' Command and Control system. It should be noted that the previous system was abandoned after load testing revealed that it would not cope with the demands likely to be placed upon it…"</i></p>
<p>In the end, the <i>new 'state of the art' system</i> was abandoned after a cost of $2.5M and perhaps 20 lives. The LAS was reduced to the following coda: <i>"The fact is that of the 26 cases considered by coroners' courts since November 1991, we are advised that not a single one has concluded that the LAS can be blamed for the death of a patient."</i></p>

"Not surprisingly, eyebrows were raised.<br />

<h2>Systems engineering education</h2>
<p>A growing number<sup title="The text in the vicinity of this tag needs citation." class="noprint">[<a  title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><i>citation&#160;needed</i></a>]</sup> of universities now offer systems engineering programs, and many other engineering programs are changing towards systems approaches to analysis, design, and testing<sup title="The text in the vicinity of this tag needs citation." class="noprint">[<a  title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><i>citation&#160;needed</i></a>]</sup>. Most systems engineering programs are offered at the masters-degree level, reflecting the industry attitude that engineering students need a foundational background in one of the traditional engineering disciplines (e.g. electrical engineering) plus practical, real-world experience in order to be effective in the more abstract realm of systems engineering. Undergraduate university programs in systems engineering are much rarer, but several institutions do offer them. <a href="/wiki/INCOSE.html" title="INCOSE">INCOSE</a> maintains a continuously updated Directory of Systems Engineering Academic Programs.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a  title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
