<p>The <b>Second Chechen War</b> is the <a href="/wiki/Military_campaign.html" title="Military campaign">military campaign</a> initiated by the <a href="/wiki/Russian_Federation.html" title="Russian Federation">Russian Federation</a> in <a href="/wiki/1999.html" title="1999">1999</a> that recaptured the <a href="/wiki/Separatist.html" title="Separatist">separatist</a> region of <a href="/wiki/Chechnya.html" title="Chechnya">Chechnya</a>, which had briefly gained <a href="/wiki/De_facto.html" title="De facto">de facto</a> <a href="/wiki/Independence.html" title="Independence">independence</a> as the <a href="/wiki/Chechen_Republic_of_Ichkeria.html" title="Chechen Republic of Ichkeria">Chechen Republic of Ichkeria</a> following the <a href="/wiki/First_Chechen_War.html" title="First Chechen War">First Chechen War</a>.</p>
<p>The war has been one of the fiercest and bloodiest <a href="/wiki/Military_conflict.html" title="Military conflict">military conflicts</a> in the world. At the turn of the <a href="/wiki/Millennium.html" title="Millennium">millennium</a> the <a href="/wiki/Russians.html" title="Russians">Russian</a> <a href="/wiki/Military.html" title="Military">military</a> and pro-Russian <a href="/wiki/Chechens.html" title="Chechens">Chechen</a> <a href="/wiki/Paramilitary.html" title="Paramilitary">paramilitary</a> forces struggled to dislodge determined Chechen separatists. The full-scale military <a href="/wiki/Offensive.html" title="Offensive">offensive</a> ended with the Russian seizure of the Chechen <a href="/wiki/Capital.html" title="Capital">capital</a> <a href="/wiki/Grozny.html" title="Grozny">Grozny</a> in <a href="/wiki/2000.html" title="2000">2000</a>, after a winter <a href="/wiki/Siege.html" title="Siege">siege</a>.

Violations of <a href="/wiki/Human_rights.html" title="Human rights">human rights</a> by the Russian forces drew international condemnation. Meanwhile, attacks by Chechen separatists against <a href="/wiki/Civilians.html" title="Civilians">civilians</a> in Russia, notably the taking of <a href="/wiki/Hostage.html" title="Hostage">hostage</a> inside a <a href="/wiki/Moscow.html" title="Moscow">Moscow</a> theater in <a href="/wiki/2002.html" title="2002">2002</a> and in a school in <a href="/wiki/Beslan.html" title="Beslan">Beslan</a> in <a href="/wiki/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>, appalled the world. The death toll from this conflict is unknown, with estimates ranging from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands dead or missing, most of them Chechnya's civilians.</p>
<p>Although sporadic fighting continues to this day, the Russian military and political campaign has succeeded in installing a pro-Moscow Chechen regime, and eliminating the most prominent Chechen separatist leaders including former <a href="/wiki/President.html" title="President">president</a> <a href="/wiki/Aslan_Maskhadov.html" title="Aslan Maskhadov">Aslan Maskhadov</a> and leading <a href="/wiki/Warlord.html" title="Warlord">warlord</a> <a href="/wiki/Shamil_Basayev.html" title="Shamil Basayev">Shamil Basayev</a>. The war bolstered the domestic popularity of <a href="/wiki/Vladimir_Putin.html" title="Vladimir Putin">Vladimir Putin</a>, who launched the military campaign one month after becoming Russian prime minister. The sagging fortunes of the Chechen <a href="/wiki/Independence.html" title="Independence">independence</a> movement, plagued by internal disunity and association with <a href="/wiki/Wahhabi.html" title="Wahhabi">Wahhabi</a> radicalism, reflect the changing global political climate after <a href="/wiki/September_11%2C_2001.html" title="September 11, 2001">September 11, 2001</a>.</p>

From <a href="/wiki/1991.html" title="1991">1991</a> to <a href="/wiki/1994.html" title="1994">1994</a>, as many as 300,000 people of non-Chechen ethnicity (mostly Russians) fled the Chechen Republic.

<h3>Chaos in Chechnya</h3>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/1997.html" title="1997">1997</a> election of separatist President <a href="/wiki/Aslan_Maskhadov.html" title="Aslan Maskhadov">Aslan Maskhadov</a> led to turbulence within the country. Despite Russia's early recognition of Chechnya's independence and the 1997 Moscow <a href="/wiki/Peace_treaty.html" title="Peace treaty">peace treaty</a>, a chilly relationship between the two nations continued. In May <a href="/wiki/1998.html" title="1998">1998</a>, Valentin Vlasov, a personal envoy of <a href="/wiki/Boris_Yeltsin.html" title="Boris Yeltsin">Boris Yeltsin</a>, was <a href="/wiki/Kidnapping.html" title="Kidnapping">kidnapped</a> outside the village of Assinovskaya; he was released on <a href="/wiki/November_13.html" title="November 13">November 13</a>. Further troubles arose in January and February of 1999 as President Maskhadov announced that <a href="/wiki/Islam.html" title="Islam">Islamic</a> <a href="/wiki/Sharia.html" title="Sharia">Sharia</a> law would be introduced in Chechnya over the course of the next three years. In March of that year, <a href="/wiki/General.html" title="General">General</a> Gennadiy Shpigun, the <a href="/wiki/Kremlin.html" title="Kremlin">Kremlin</a>'s envoy to Chechnya, was kidnapped at the airport in <a href="/wiki/Grozny.html" title="Grozny">Grozny</a>. He was ultimately killed in 2000.</p>
<p>The Grozny <a href="/wiki/Government.html" title="Government">government</a>'s grip on the chaotic Republic was weak. On <a href="/wiki/October_25.html" title="October 25">October 25</a>, <a href="/wiki/1998.html" title="1998">1998</a>, Shadid Bargishev, Chechnya's top anti-kidnapping <a href="/wiki/Official.html" title="Official">official</a>, was killed in a <a href="/wiki/Remote_control.html" title="Remote control">remote controlled</a> <a href="/wiki/Car_bomb.html" title="Car bomb">car bombing</a> as he was about to begin a major campaign against hostage-takers.

On <a href="/wiki/June_21.html" title="June 21">June 21</a> the Chechen security chief, Lecha Khulygov, and a guerrilla commander, Vakha Dzhafarov, fatally shot each other in an argument. In 1998 and 1999 President Maskhadov survived several <a href="/wiki/Assassination.html" title="Assassination">assassination</a> attempts. The internal violence in Chechnya peaked on <a href="/wiki/July_16.html" title="July 16">July 16</a>, <a href="/wiki/1998.html" title="1998">1998</a>, when fighting broke out between Maskhadov's <a href="/wiki/National_Guard.html" title="National Guard">National Guard</a> led by <a href="/wiki/Sulim_Yamadayev.html" title="Sulim Yamadayev">Sulim Yamadayev</a> and radical <a href="/wiki/Wahhabi.html" title="Wahhabi">Wahhabi</a> militants in the town of <a href="/wiki/Gudermes.html" title="Gudermes">Gudermes</a>; over 50 people were reported killed.</p>
<p>On several occasions, Russian <a href="/wiki/Special_forces.html" title="Special forces">special forces</a> raided Chechen territory. In July 1999, the Russian Interior Ministry troops destroyed a Chechen border post, and on <a href="/wiki/July_29.html" title="July 29">July 29</a>, they captured a stragegic 800 meter-section of roadway.

<p>In August and September of 1999, <a href="/wiki/Shamil_Basayev.html" title="Shamil Basayev">Shamil Basayev</a> led two armies of 1,200 to 2,000 Chechen, Dagestani, Arab and <a href="/wiki/Kazakhs.html" title="Kazakhs">Kazakh</a> militants from Chechnya into the neighbouring <a href="/wiki/Republic_of_Dagestan.html" title="Republic of Dagestan">Republic of Dagestan</a>. The purpose was to help local Islamic <a href="/wiki/Fundamentalist.html" title="Fundamentalist">fundamentalists</a> who were under attack by federal forces in the villages of Kadar, Karamakhi, and Chabanmakhi. This conflict saw the first use of aerial-delivered <a href="/wiki/Fuel_air_explosive.html" title="Fuel air explosive">fuel air explosives</a> (FAE) in populated areas, notably in the village of Tando. By mid-September 1999, the militants were routed from the villages and pushed back into Chechnya. At least several hundred people were killed in the fighting; the federal side reported 279 servicemen killed and approximately 987 wounded.</p>
<p>The Russian government then began a bombing campaign in southeastern Chechnya, a region which they saw as a staging area for Chechen militants. On <a href="/wiki/September_23.html" title="September 23">September 23</a>, Russian <a href="/wiki/Fighter_jet.html" title="Fighter jet">fighter jets</a> bombed targets in and around Grozny.</p>

<h3>Invasion</h3>
<p>In late September 1999, the Russian <a href="/wiki/Military.html" title="Military">military</a> began bombing targets within Chechnya and ground troops followed soon after. In response, <a href="/wiki/Martial_law.html" title="Martial law">martial law</a> was declared in Ichkeria and <a href="/wiki/Military_reserves.html" title="Military reserves">reservists</a> were called. President Maskhadov declared a <i>gazavat</i> (holy war) to confront the approaching Russian army. At this time, Russia's new <a href="/wiki/Prime_Minister.html" title="Prime Minister">Prime Minister</a> <a href="/wiki/Vladimir_Putin.html" title="Vladimir Putin">Vladimir Putin</a> announced that the Russian troops would advance only as far as the <a href="/wiki/Terek_River.html" title="Terek River">Terek River</a>, which cuts the northern third of Chechnya off from the rest of the republic. Putin's stated intention was to take control of Chechnya's northern plain and establish a <a href="/wiki/Cordon_sanitaire.html" title="Cordon sanitaire">cordon sanitaire</a> against further Chechen aggression.</p>
<p>The Russian army moved with ease in the wide open spaces of northern Chechnya and soon reached the Terek River.

Hoping to avoid the significant casualties which plagued the <a href="/wiki/First_Chechen_War.html" title="First Chechen War">First Chechen War</a>, the Russians advanced slowly and in force. The Russian military made extensive use of <a href="/wiki/Artillery.html" title="Artillery">artillery</a> and <a href="/wiki/Air_power.html" title="Air power">air power</a> in an attempt to soften Chechen defences. On <a href="/wiki/November_7.html" title="November 7">November 7</a>, Russian soldiers dislodged <a href="/wiki/Rebel.html" title="Rebel">rebels</a> in Bamut, the rebel <a href="/wiki/Stronghold.html" title="Stronghold">stronghold</a> in the first war; at least 28 Chechen fighters and many civilians were reported killed.</p>
<p>Many thousands of civilians fled the Russian advance, leaving Chechnya for neighbouring Russian republics. Their numbers were later estimated to reach 200,000 to 350,000, out of the approximately 800,000 residents of the Chechen Republic. The Russians appeared to be taking no chances with the Chechen population in its rear areas, setting up notorious <a href="/wiki/Concentration_camp.html" title="Concentration camp">filtration camps</a> in October in northern Chechnya for detaining suspected members of <i>bandformirovaniya</i> (bandit formations).</p>

<h3>Battle of Grozny</h3>
<p>It was not until November that the Chechen capital of <a href="/wiki/Grozny.html" title="Grozny">Grozny</a> was surrounded, and more than two additional weeks of shelling and bombing were required before Russian troops were able to claim a foothold within any part of the heavily <a href="/wiki/Fortification.html" title="Fortification">fortified</a> city. With approximately 100,000 troops supported by a powerful air force, the Russian army vastly outnumbered and outgunned the Chechen defence <a href="/wiki/Militia.html" title="Militia">militia</a>, comprising several thousand fighters, and was considerably larger than the Russian force that had been defeated in Chechnya during the previous war. In addition, Russia's tactics in this second campaign were drastically different. The strategy in 1999 was to hold back tanks, vulnerable <a href="/wiki/Armored_personnel_carrier.html" title="Armored personnel carrier">armoured personnel carriers (APC)</a> and <a href="/wiki/Infantry.html" title="Infantry">infantry</a> and subject the entrenched Chechens to an intensive <a href="/wiki/Barrage.html" title="Barrage">barrage</a> of heavy artillery and <a href="/wiki/Aerial_bombardment.html" title="Aerial bombardment">aerial bombardment</a> before engaging them.</p>
<p>In November, the Kremlin appointed Beslan Gantamirov, former mayor of Grozny, as head of the pro-Moscow Chechen State Council. Gantamirov was just pardoned by President Yeltsin and released from a 6-year sentence for <a href="/wiki/Embezzling.html" title="Embezzling">embezzling</a> federal funds to rebuild Chechnya in 1995-1996; he was chosen to lead a pro-Russian Chechen militia force in the upcoming battle. Gantamirov soon locked horns with the then interior minister, <a href="/wiki/Vladimir_Rushailo.html" title="Vladimir Rushailo">Vladimir Rushailo</a>, who refused to supply Chechen troops with APCs, <a href="/wiki/Mortar_%28weapon%29.html" title="Mortar (weapon)">mortars</a> or <a href="/wiki/Sniper_rifle.html" title="Sniper rifle">sniper rifles</a>, limiting their combat arsenal to "obsolete <a href="/wiki/AK-47.html" title="AK-47">AK-47s</a> which jammed after a few shots". In the wake of the Grozny <a href="/wiki/Siege.html" title="Siege">siege</a>, Rushailo publicly accused Gantamirov of accepting "any <a href="/wiki/Volunteers.html" title="Volunteers">volunteers</a> into the ranks of the Chechen militia including rebel fighters". However, the Chechen militia went on to play a pivotal role in the siege of Grozny, suffering more than 700 casualties during the fighting. On <a href="/wiki/May_30.html" title="May 30">30 May</a> <a href="/wiki/2000.html" title="2000">2000</a>, Russia's main official in Chechnya, Nikolai Koshman, said his deputy, Gantemirov was dismissed for "non-fulfilment of his duties." Koshman also said that the pro-Moscow Chechen militia has lost 295 out of its remaining 353 members for absenteeism. <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.rferl.org/features/2000/05/F.RU.000530155752.asp">[6]</a></p>
<p>As many as 40,000 civilians, many of them ethnic Russians, remained trapped in Grozny during the Russian <a href="/wiki/Siege.html" title="Siege">siege</a> of the city, suffering from the bombing, cold and hunger. Civilian motorcades attempting to leave besieged areas via Russian-guarded <a href="/wiki/Safe_corridor.html" title="Safe corridor">safe corridors</a> were fired on at Russian police checkpoints, wounded survivors reported.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a  title="">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p>Grozny itself was transformed into a <a href="/wiki/Fortress.html" title="Fortress">fortress</a> under the leadership of Chechen field commander Aslambek Ismailov. The Chechen fighters in the capital put up a fierce resistance to the Russians throughout the months of November and December. Grozny's Chechen defenders built a system of <a href="/wiki/Bunker.html" title="Bunker">bunkers</a> behind <a href="/wiki/Apartment_building.html" title="Apartment building">apartment buildings</a>, laid <a href="/wiki/Land_mine.html" title="Land mine">mines</a> throughout the city, placed <a href="/wiki/Snipers.html" title="Snipers">snipers</a> on rooftops, and withstood the heavy Russian bombardment for the chance to finally come to grips with the enemy in an environment of their choosing.</p>

<p>In December Russian general staff began dropping <a href="/wiki/Leaflets.html" title="Leaflets">leaflets</a> in Grozny announcing that everyone who did not leave would be considered bandits and terrorists and would subsequently be destroyed by <a href="/wiki/Aviation.html" title="Aviation">aviation</a> and artillery.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a  title="">[11]</a></sup> In the face of international outrage by the <a href="/wiki/United_States.html" title="United States">United States</a>, the <a href="/wiki/European_Union.html" title="European Union">European Union</a> and human rights groups, Russia withdrew the <a href="/wiki/Ultimatum.html" title="Ultimatum">ultimatum</a>, but the campaign against Grozny continued with renewed vigour. By January 2000, Russia's heavy bombardments had finally begun to take their toll. Using <a href="/wiki/Multiple_rocket_launcher.html" title="Multiple rocket launcher">multiple rocket launchers</a> and massed tank and artillery fire, the Russians flattened most of Grozny in preparation for a mass assault.

<p>On <a href="/wiki/January_3.html" title="January 3">January 3</a>, Russian General Valentin Astaviyev said on state television that Russian forces had suffered only three dead in the past 24 hours; but the commander of an Interior Ministry unit in Grozny told <a href="/wiki/AFP.html" title="AFP">AFP</a> news agency that 50 men had been killed in the previous 48 hours. An undercover investigation by <a href="/wiki/NTV.html" title="NTV">NTV</a> has reported that up to 50 Russian soldiers are being killed in Chechnya daily; the figure was compiled from reports from witnesses, <a href="/wiki/Morgue.html" title="Morgue">morgue</a> officials, railway workers and <a href="/wiki/Coroner.html" title="Coroner">coroner</a>'s assistants.<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a  title="">[13]</a></sup> On <a href="/wiki/January_4.html" title="January 4">January 4</a>, Chechen fighters in Grozny had launched <a href="/wiki/Counter_attack.html" title="Counter attack">counter attacks</a> and broken through Russian lines in at least two places, temporarily seizing the village of <a  class="new" title="Alkhan-Kala">Alkhan-Kala</a>.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a  title="">[14]</a></sup> Both sides accused each other of launching chemical attacks.</p>

The commander for the North Caucasus, General <a href="/wiki/Viktor_Kazantsev.html" title="Viktor Kazantsev">Viktor Kazantsev</a>, said mistakes by "soft-hearted" Russian interior ministry officials had allowed the rebels to counter-attack; he said from now on only boys under 10, old men over 60 and girls and women would be considered as <a href="/wiki/Refugees.html" title="Refugees">refugees</a>.<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a  title="">[15]</a></sup> An interior ministry spokesman said 26 Russian soldiers had died in the past 24 hours, the heaviest one-day official death toll since fighting began last September.

<p>On <a href="/wiki/January_26.html" title="January 26">January 26</a>, the Russian government announced that 1,173 servicemen had been killed since October <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/618971.stm">[7]</a> - a more than double rise from 544 killed reported 19 days earlier, on <a href="/wiki/January_6.html" title="January 6">January 6</a>,<a  class="external autonumber" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/592919.stm">[8]</a> with just 300 killed reported on <a href="/wiki/January_4.html" title="January 4">January 4</a>.<a  class="external autonumber" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/monitoring/media_reports/595521.stm">[9]</a></p>
<p>By mid-January, tens of thousands of Russian soldiers began an advance on central Grozny from three directions.

It was decided that taking on the Russians in frontal combat was becoming too costly. As the Russian army closed in on their positions, the Chechen commanders decided on a desperate gamble; success was not assured, for the city was encircled by <a href="/wiki/Land_mine.html" title="Land mine">mine fields</a> and three layers of Russian forces.</p>

<p><a name="Rebel_breakout" id="Rebel_breakout"></a></p>
<h4>Rebel breakout</h4>
<p>The Chechens began to escape on the last day of January and first day of February under intense Russian bombardment. As the Chechen fighters broke out, moving in a southwesterly direction, they were met with artillery fire. One of the main <a href="/wiki/Retreat.html" title="Retreat">retreating</a> units, led by Shamil Basayev, hit a minefield between the city and the village of Alkhan-Kala. As Russian artillery fire homed in on their position, several of the Chechens' field commanders personally led their retreating soldiers in a charge across the minefields. Volunteers were asked to run ahead of the main force to clear a path for their retreating comrades. Scores of Chechen <i><a href="/wiki/Shaheed.html" title="Shaheed">shaheed</a></i> were killed as well as several prominent Chechen commanders, including generals Khunkarpasha Israpilov and Aslambek Ismailov, the mastermind behind the defense of Grozny, and the city mayor Lecha Dudayev. In addition to these commanders, many rank-and-file Chechen fighters were apparently killed in the bloody escape. The Russians later claimed to have killed 200 Chechen fighters. Another 200 were maimed, including Basayev.</p>
<p>A rebel post-operative war <a href="/wiki/Committee.html" title="Committee">council</a> was held in <a  class="new" title="Alkhan-Yurt">Alkhan-Yurt</a>, where it was decided that the Chechen forces would retreat into the inaccessible <a href="/wiki/Vedeno.html" title="Vedeno">Vedeno</a> and Argun <a href="/wiki/Gorge.html" title="Gorge">gorges</a> in the southern mountains to carry on a <a href="/wiki/Guerrilla.html" title="Guerrilla">guerrilla</a> war against the Russians. The Russian army's last chance to destroy the rebels in a concentrated position was thus lost, and the Chechens scattered into the southern mountains to continue the war.</p>
<p>In Grozny itself, the Russian generals initially refused to admit that the Chechens had escaped from the blockaded city, saying that fierce fighting continued within the city. Russian <a href="/wiki/Spokesman.html" title="Spokesman">spokesman</a> and Putin's aide Sergei Yastrzhembsky said, "If they left Grozny, we would have informed you." <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/626959.stm">[10]</a> It was not until <a href="/wiki/February_6.html" title="February 6">February 6</a> that the Russians were able to raise the <a href="/wiki/Flag_of_Russia.html" title="Flag of Russia">Russian flag</a> above the city centre.

The drivers wore federal military uniforms and carried official passes which allowed them through three successive military checkpoints on their way to the headquarters building; a guard at the fourth and final checkpoint attempted to inspect the vehicles, and began firing on the trucks as they drove through the checkpoint towards the building. Chechen officials said about 80 people were killed and 210 wounded, and Basayev claimed responsibility for a planning and execution of the attack.<sup title="The text in the vicinity of this tag needs citation." class="noprint">[<a  title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><i>citation&#160;needed</i></a>]</sup></li>

<h3>Unilateral ceasefire and death of Maskhadov</h3>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/February_2.html" title="February 2">February 2</a>, <a href="/wiki/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>, Chechen rebel president <a href="/wiki/Aslan_Maskhadov.html" title="Aslan Maskhadov">Aslan Maskhadov</a> issued a call for a <a href="/wiki/Ceasefire.html" title="Ceasefire">ceasefire</a> lasting until at least <a href="/wiki/February_22.html" title="February 22">February 22</a>: the day preceding the anniversary of Stalin's deportation of the Chechen population. The call was issued through a separatist website and addressed to President Putin, described as a gesture of goodwill.</p>
<p>But on <a href="/wiki/March_8.html" title="March 8">March 8</a>, <a href="/wiki/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>, Maskhadov was "liquidated" in an operation by Russian security forces in the Chechen community of <a  class="new" title="Tolstoy-Yurt">Tolstoy-Yurt</a>, northeast of Grozny, and branded an "international terrorist."</p>
<p>Shortly following Maskhadov's death, the Chechen rebel council announced that <a href="/wiki/Abdul-Khalim_Sadulayev.html" title="Abdul-Khalim Sadulayev">Abdul-Khalim Sadulayev</a> had assumed the leadership, a move that was quickly endorsed by Shamil Basayev. On <a href="/wiki/February_2.html" title="February 2">February 2</a>, <a href="/wiki/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> Sadulayev made large-scale changes in his government, ordering all its members to move into Chechen territory.

<h3>Radicalisation of the Chechen insurgents</h3>
<p>The Chechen insurgents are becoming more and more radicalised. Former <a href="/wiki/Soviet_army.html" title="Soviet army">Soviet army</a> officers General Djokhar Dudaev and Colonel Aslan Maskhadov, have been succeeded by people who rely more and more on the religious feelings rather than the nationalistic feelings of the population. While Dudaev and Maskhadov were seeking from Moscow recognition of the independence of the Chechen Republic Ichkeria, Sadulaev and Basaev speak out more and more about the need to expel Russia from the territory of the whole <a href="/wiki/North_Caucasus.html" title="North Caucasus">North Caucasus</a>, an impoverished mountain region inhabited mostly by Muslim, non-Russian ethnic groups.</p>
<p>In April 2006, asked whether negotiations with Russians are possible, the top rebel commander and then-new Vice-President Doku Umarov answered:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"We offered them many times. But it turned out that we constantly press for negotiations and it's as if we are always standing with an extended hand and this is taken as a sign of our weakness. Therefore we don't plan to do this any more. And the reshuffle of the (rebel) Cabinet of Ministers is connected to this."</dd>
</dl>
<p>In the same month, the new rebel spokesman <a href="/wiki/Movladi_Udugov.html" title="Movladi Udugov">Movladi Udugov</a> said that attacks should be expected anywhere in Russia in 2006: "The minimum goal -- not to surrender -- has been met. Today, we have a different task on our hands -- <a href="/wiki/Total_war.html" title="Total war">total war</a>, war everywhere our enemy can be reached. (...) And this means mounting attacks at any place, not just in the Caucasus but in all Russia." It was not clear whether Udugov meant a return to the type of terrorist acts, not seen since 2004, or military style operations. Reflecting growing radicalization of the Chechen-led guerrillas, Udugov said their goal was no longer Western-style <a href="/wiki/Democracy.html" title="Democracy">democracy</a> and independence, but an Islamist "North Caucasian <a href="/wiki/Emirate.html" title="Emirate">Emirate</a>."</p>
<p>But regardless of goals and tasks announced by the current leaders of the separatists, the insurgents continue to enjoy the support of a significant part of the population of the Chechen Republic.</p>

<p><a name="Caucasus_Front" id="Caucasus_Front"></a></p>
<h3>Caucasus Front</h3>
<p>In May 2005, two months after Maskahdov's death, the Chechen separatists officially announced that they had formed a <a href="/wiki/Caucasus_Front.html" title="Caucasus Front">Caucasus Front</a> within the framework of "reforming the system of military-political power." Along with the Chechen, Dagestani and Ingush "sectors," the <a href="/wiki/Stavropol.html" title="Stavropol">Stavropol</a>, <a href="/wiki/Kabardin.html" title="Kabardin">Kabardin</a>-<a href="/wiki/Balkar.html" title="Balkar">Balkar</a>, <a href="/wiki/Krasnodar.html" title="Krasnodar">Krasnodar</a>, <a href="/wiki/Karachai.html" title="Karachai">Karachai</a>-<a href="/wiki/Circassian.html" title="Circassian">Circassian</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ossetian.html" title="Ossetian">Ossetian</a> and Adighy "jamaats" were included in it. This, in essence, means that practically all the regions of the Russia's south will be involved in the hostilities.</p>
<p>The Chechen separatist movement has taken on a new role as the official ideological, logistical and, probably, financial hub of the new insurgency in the North Caucasus. Increasingly frequent clashes between federal forces and local militants continue in Dagestan, while sporadic fighting erupts in the other southern Russia regions, most notably in Ingushetia.</p>

The raid lasted nearly five hours, and the assailants withdrew almost unscathed with a large quantities of capured weapons; the raiders apparently lost only two men during the attacks (five according to Basayev).

Same month, the Ramzan Kadyrov government officially took control of Chechnya's <a href="/wiki/Oil_industry.html" title="Oil industry">oil industry</a> and rejected a federal proposition of the republican <a href="/wiki/Budget.html" title="Budget">budget</a>, demanding much more money to be sent from Moscow; for years, Chechnya was know as a Russia's "financial black hole" where the funds are widely embezzled and tend to vanish without trace. On <a href="/wiki/March_30.html" title="March 30">March 30</a>, 2006, Interfax reported Chechen People's Assembly Chairman Dukvakha Abdurakhmanov has spoken in favour of a complete withdrawal of all Russian federal forces except the border guards.</p>
<p>In April 2006 Kadyrov himself criticized remaining units of <a href="/wiki/Federal_police.html" title="Federal police">federal police</a>, namely Operational/Search Bureau (ORB-2), and called for their immediate withdrawal from the republic. He also called for <a href="/wiki/Refugee_camps.html" title="Refugee camps">refugee camps</a> scattered about Chechnya to be closed down, saying they were populated by "international spies" intent on destabilizing the region. Later this month, Abdurakhmanov said Chechnya should be merged with Ingushetia and Dagestan; Ingush and Dagestani leaders disagreed. Paradoxically, a merger would reflect the will of Chechen separatists of establishing an Islamic state across the North Caucasus.</p>

Alkhanov also dismissed reports of conflicts with Kadyrov, who is widely believed to want to take over the presidency when he turns 30 in October and can legally assume the job.</p>

The hostage-takers demanded an end to the Russian presence in Chechnya, and threatened to execute the hostages if their conditions were not met. The siege ended violently on <a href="/wiki/October_26.html" title="October 26">October 26</a>, when Russian troops stormed the building. More than one hundred of the hostages perished from the incapacitating effects of <a href="/wiki/Kolokol-1.html" title="Kolokol-1">knockout gas</a> used by the Russian forces.

<h3>Trials of Chechen fighters</h3>
<p>Since the Russian authorities do not treat the war as an <a href="/wiki/Armed_conflict.html" title="Armed conflict">armed conflict</a> and enemies as <a href="/wiki/Combatants.html" title="Combatants">combatants</a>, the secessionist Chechen fighters are invariably described by the Russian government as terrorists or bandits. Captured rebels are routinely tried for such articles of the Russian criminal code as illegal weapons possession, "forming and participating in illegal armed groups," and banditry. This strips detainees of key rights and protections under the <a href="/wiki/Geneva_Conventions.html" title="Geneva Conventions">Geneva Conventions</a> rules of war, including the right to be released at the end of the conflict and not to be held criminally liable for lawful combat. Participation in combat is treated as a murder or <a href="/wiki/Attempted_murder.html" title="Attempted murder">attempted murder</a> and terrorism, making little if any distinction with incidents of actual murders and terrorism.</p>

Many figures have been quoted, some greatly exaggerated; a figure of 250,000 dead in the two wars is sometimes repeated, but without there being adequate substantiation of such a number. Cherkasov's conclusion is rationally arrived at: "the total number of peaceful residents of the Chechen Republic who perished during the two wars may have reached 70,000." He admits that the accuracy of these estimates is not high. With reference to the second war, he concludes: "The total number of civilians killed, including those who disappeared, adds up to between 14,800 to 24,100."</li>

Some bore signs of mutilation, including stab wounds, broken limbs, flayed body parts, severed fingertips and ears cut off, and many had their hands tied behind them and had been blindfolded. Of the nineteen victims whose corpses were identified by relatives, sixteen were last seen as Russian federal forces took them into custody. Human rights groups suggested that Russian servicemen at the Khankala base used the Dachny (also called Zdorovye) <a href="/wiki/Dacha.html" title="Dacha">dacha</a> settlement as a disposal site for executed prisoners. At the beginning of the second Chechen war, numerous unofficial places of detention existed throughout Chechnya, many of them in the form of earth pits, and the biggest such facility was located on the territory of the headquarters of the federal army in Khankala.</li>

<dd>In June 2006, Russia's leading human rights groups has produced what it says is documentary evidence of a secret torture and murder cell in the basement of a former school for deaf children in the Oktyabrskaya district. According to Memorial, Russian police used the dungeon to torture and murder hundreds of people, and was decommissioned only last month, when the federal Russian police unit occupying the building withdrew. According to the republic's prosecutor, Valery Kuznetsov, several criminal cases involving the disappearance of people allegedly dispatched to the "temporary holding cells" are being investigated. But Nurdi Nukhajiev, Chechnya's government-appointed representative for human rights, said: "I am not saying that the people [policemen] were ideal individuals. But this is 2006 and they weren't so stupid as to leave evidence of torture and murder behind." Memorial says it collected the evidence just in time and that the building housing the cellar has since been demolished in a crude attempt at a cover-up. <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://news.independent.co.uk/europe/article753719.ece">[86]</a></dd>

<h3>Early conflict</h3>
<p>Among ordinary Russian citizens, there existed a strong perception that Chechnya was firmly a part of Russia. The notion that it might secede was implausible and unacceptable, even after events of the First Chechen War; the violent acts of Chechen militants were portrayed within Russia as having been carried out by dangerous, unrepresentative fringe groups. Within the Russian government, there was a concern that allowing Chechnya substantial autonomy might lead to a domino effect—other regions within the already-fragmented former Soviet Union might choose to follow suit.</p>
<p>Motivated by these factors, President Yeltsin authorized the invasion of Chechnya. Many argue over whether Yeltsin genuinely believed that victory would be swift and decisive, or that his assertions to that effect were simply meant to assuage the concerns of Russian citizens. Despite assembling a much larger and better-supported force than was brought to bear in the First Chechen War, the Russian army sustained appreciable losses but won the bloody battle for Grozny.</p>

<h3>Rule of Putin</h3>
<p>The election of <a href="/wiki/Vladimir_Putin.html" title="Vladimir Putin">Vladimir Putin</a> to the Russian presidency changed the tenor of the Chechen conflict; Putin was often less concerned about Western public opinion than Yeltsin, and continued to prosecute the war.</p>
<p>Putin officially reestablished Russian rule in Chechnya in 2000; this development met with early approval in the rest of Russia, but the continued deaths of Russian troops dampened public enthusiasm. Following the <a href="/wiki/September_11%2C_2001_attacks.html" title="September 11, 2001 attacks">September 11, 2001 attacks</a> in the <a href="/wiki/United_States.html" title="United States">United States</a>, Putin was able to attract more foreign support for his actions in Chechnya by highlighting the links between Chechen rebels and <a href="/wiki/Islamism.html" title="Islamism">Islamist</a> terrorist groups such as <a href="/wiki/Al-Qaeda.html" title="Al-Qaeda">Al-Qaeda</a>.</p>
<p>Although large-scale fighting within Chechnya has ceased, daily attacks continue. The local government is not stable and Russians are mindful of the potential for renewed conflict. Russia continues to maintain a substantial military presence within Chechnya.</p>
<p>President Putin and newly-minted Chechen leaders face a difficult task of restoring stability to the region and convincing the Russian people that they can manage the situation effectively. Currently the FSB has taken over the operations in Chechnya. Most soldiers in Chechnya are now <i>kontraktniki</i> (contract soldiers) as opposed to the earlier conscripts. Local militias are also being used to provide security. Ironically, many of the militiamen are former Chechen rebels from the First Chechen War.</p>

Russian psychiatrists, law-enforcement officials and journalists have started calling the condition Chechen <a href="/wiki/Syndrome.html" title="Syndrome">syndrome</a> (CS), drawing a parallel with the <a href="/wiki/Post-traumatic_stress_disorder.html" title="Post-traumatic stress disorder">post-traumatic stress disorders</a> suffered by American soldiers who served in <a href="/wiki/Vietnam.html" title="Vietnam">Vietnam</a> and Soviet soldiers who fought in <a href="/wiki/Afghanistan.html" title="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a>. "At least 70% of the estimated 1.5 million Chechnya veterans suffer CS," says Yuri Alexandrovsky, deputy director of the Serbsky National Center for Social and Forensic <a href="/wiki/Psychiatry.html" title="Psychiatry">Psychiatry</a> in Moscow. "Some readjust. Many don't. All need help." <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://205.188.238.181/time/europe/magazine/printout/0,13155,901031006-490663,00.html">[88]</a></p>
<p><b>Police brutality</b></p>
<p>This is particulary visible in the rising <a href="/wiki/Police_brutality.html" title="Police brutality">brutality</a> and <a href="/wiki/Criminalisation.html" title="Criminalisation">criminalisation</a> of the Russian police forces. According to human rights activists and journalists, tens of thousands of police and security forces have done <a href="/wiki/Tour_of_duty.html" title="Tour of duty">tours of duty</a> in Chechnya, after which they return to their home regions, bringing with them learned patterns of brutality and impunity.</p>
<p>In a 2003 report, the International Helsinki Federation said "torture, ill-treatment and inhumane and degrading treatment are commonly employed in order to get a confession to a crime." A Human Rights Watch report said that in the first hours after detention, "police regularly beat their captives, nearly <a href="/wiki/Asphyxiate.html" title="Asphyxiate">asphyxiate</a> them, or subject them to <a href="/wiki/Electroshock.html" title="Electroshock">electroshock</a> in pursuit of confessions or testimony incriminating others".</p>
<p>Reliable numbers on police brutality are hard to come by. In a statement released <a href="/wiki/January_31.html" title="January 31">January 31</a>, 2006, the internal affairs department of Russia's Interior Ministry said that the number of recorded crimes by police officers rose 46.8 percent in 2005. In one nationwide poll in 2005, 71 percent of respondents said they didn't trust the police; in another, 41 percent said they lived in fear of police violence.</p>
<p><b>Impact on the Chechen population</b></p>
<p>The 2003 <a href="/wiki/WHO.html" title="WHO">WHO</a> in-depth study of the psychological health of the population of Chechnya, which has experienced crisis almost continuously since 1991, concluded that 86 percent of the Chechen population was suffering from physical or emotional "distress" - about 30 percent more than people living in the <a href="/wiki/Chernobyl.html" title="Chernobyl">Chernobyl</a> reactive zone. 31 percent of those studied showed symptoms of ill health recognizable as post-traumatic stress syndrome. <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.hrvc.net/news2-03/7c-2-2003.htm">[89]</a></p>
<p>Psychologists are discovering that a whole generation of Chechen children is showing symptoms of <a href="/wiki/Psychological_trauma.html" title="Psychological trauma">trauma</a>. In 2006 Sultan Alimkhadzhiyev, pro-Russian Chechnya's deputy health minister, said the Chechen children had become "living specimens" of what it means to grow up with the constant threat of violence and chronic joblessness and poverty. "Our children have seen bombings, artillery attacks, large-caliber bombardment. They saw houses, schools and hospitals burning. They lost parents, brothers, sisters, neighbors. And they still see tanks and armored vehicles every day in the street. (...) A state of panic. Children are feeling constant fear, a premonition of tragedy." <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/la-fg-sickness10mar10,1,6583819.story">[90]</a></p>

<h3>Rise of racism and xenophobia</h3>
<p>The war in Chechnya and the associated Caucasian terrorism in Russia and <a href="/wiki/Russophobia#Caucasian_aspects.html" title="Russophobia">ethnic cleansing of Russians in the North Caucasus</a> resulted in growing <a href="/wiki/Intolerance.html" title="Intolerance">intolerance</a> and <a href="/wiki/Racism.html" title="Racism">racist violence</a> in Russia, directed in a great part against the people from Caucasus. Even while the Russian authorities are unlikely to label attacks on people with dark skin as racist, preferring calling this "<a href="/wiki/Hooliganism.html" title="Hooliganism">hooliganism</a>", a report in November 2005 found that murders officially classified as racist more than doubled in Russia between 2003 and 2004 from around 20 to at least 45.</p>
<p>A nationwide opinion poll in 2005 found that 61% of respondents approved of the "Russia for Russians" slogan, almost twice the 31% level recorded in 1998. <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.time.com/time/europe/magazine/printout/0,13155,901040809-674718,00.html">[91]</a> According to the 2006 poll by the Public Opinion Foundation, 12% of Russians see "positive ideas" in <a href="/wiki/Fascism.html" title="Fascism">fascism</a>; 24% think that people who hold fascist views do not constitute a danger to society.</p>
