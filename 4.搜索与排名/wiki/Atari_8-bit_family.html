An Atari 800XL, one of the most popular machines in the series.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><a href="/wiki/Atari.html" title="Atari">Atari</a> built a series of <a href="/wiki/8-bit.html" title="8-bit">8-bit</a> <a href="/wiki/Home_computer.html" title="Home computer">home computers</a> based on the <a href="/wiki/MOS_Technology.html" title="MOS Technology">MOS Technology</a> <a href="/wiki/MOS_Technology_6502.html" title="MOS Technology 6502">6502</a> <a href="/wiki/Central_processing_unit.html" title="Central processing unit">CPU</a>, starting in <a href="/wiki/1979.html" title="1979">1979</a>. Over the next decade several versions of the same basic design would be released. These included the original <b>Atari 400</b> and <b>800</b>, and their successors, the <b>XL</b> and <b>XE</b> series of computers. However, the models remained largely identical internally. They were the first home computers designed with custom coprocessor chips. IBM even considered licensing Atari for their own personal computer, but decided to build their own. However, design flaws, internal corporate turmoil and difficult, fast-changing market conditions contributed to the 8-bit Atari computers' eventual demise.</p>

<h2>History</h2>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Origins">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Origins" id="Origins"></a></p>
<h3>Origins</h3>
<p>As soon as the <a href="/wiki/Atari_2600.html" title="Atari 2600">Atari 2600</a> was released, the engineering team from Atari's Grass Valley Research Center(calling themselves <i>Cyan Engineering</i>), started work on its eventual replacement. They felt that the 2600 would have about a three year lifespan, and tried to limit themselves to those features that could be perfected by that time. What they ended up with was essentially a "corrected" version of the 2600, fixing its more obvious flaws.</p>
<p>The newer design would be faster than the 2600, have better graphics, and include much better sound hardware. Work on the chips for the new system continued throughout 1978, primarily focusing on the much-improved video hardware known as the <a href="/wiki/Color_Television_Interface_Adapter.html" title="Color Television Interface Adapter">CTIA</a> (the 2600 used a chip known as the <a href="/wiki/Television_Interface_Adapter.html" title="Television Interface Adapter">TIA</a>).</p>
<p>However, at this point, the home computer revolution took off in the form of the <a href="/wiki/Apple_II_family.html" title="Apple II family">Apple II family</a>, <a href="/wiki/Commodore_PET.html" title="Commodore PET">Commodore PET</a> and <a href="/wiki/TRS-80.html" title="TRS-80">TRS-80</a>. Ray Kassar, the new CEO of Atari, wanted the new chips to be used in a home computer to challenge Apple. Atari researched on what would be needed to produce a workable home computer of their own. This included support for character graphics (something the 2600 didn't support), some form of expansion for <a href="/wiki/Peripheral.html" title="Peripheral">peripherals</a>, the <a href="/wiki/BASIC_programming_language.html" title="BASIC programming language">BASIC programming language</a>, and a keyboard.</p>

<p><a name="ANTIC" id="ANTIC"></a></p>
<h4>ANTIC</h4>
<p>Cyan's main area of work during this period was the creation of two advanced LSI chips known as <a href="/wiki/ANTIC.html" title="ANTIC">ANTIC</a> and <a href="/wiki/George%27s_Television_Interface_Adapter.html" title="George's Television Interface Adapter">GTIA</a>. Together, they formed the heart of Atari's graphics. <i>ANTIC</i> was really a microprocessor which processed display instructions. A complete sequence of instructions was known as a <i>Display List</i>. Each instruction described how each line was to be displayed (character or graphics), where it was displayed, if it contained interrupts, if fine scrolling was enabled or not, or where to load data from memory (character sets or graphics information). <i>ANTIC</i> read this <i>display list</i> using DMA (Direct Memory Access), then translated this <i>display list</i> into electrical data for <i>GTIA</i> to process. All of this was without any CPU intervention.</p>

<p><a name="CTIA" id="CTIA"></a></p>
<h4>CTIA</h4>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Color_Television_Interface_Adapter.html" title="Color Television Interface Adapter">Color Television Interface Adapter</a> is the graphics chip used in early Atari 400/800 home computers. The chip is the successor to the TIA chip used in the Atari 2600. The chip was later replaced with the GTIA in later revisions of the 400 and 800, and in all other members of the Atari 8-bit family. In BASIC, type POKE 623,64 [RETURN] and if the screen blackens, you have the GTIA chip. If it stays blue, you have the old CTIA chip.</p>
<p>According to Joe Decuir, George McLeod designed the CTIA (Colleen TIA) in 1977. McLeod also designed the GTIA.</p>

<p><a name="GTIA" id="GTIA"></a></p>
<h4>GTIA</h4>
<p><a href="/wiki/George%27s_Television_Interface_Adapter.html" title="George's Television Interface Adapter">GTIA</a> receives graphics information from <i>ANTIC</i> and also controls <a href="/wiki/Sprite_%28computer_graphics%29.html" title="Sprite (computer graphics)">sprites</a>, collision detection, priority control and color-luminance (brightness) control to all objects including DMA objects from <i>ANTIC</i>. <i>GTIA</i> takes all this information and outputs them as separate digital luminance and chrominance signals, which are mixed to form an analogue composite video signal.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: POKEY">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="POKEY" id="POKEY"></a></p>
<h4>POKEY</h4>
<p>The third custom support chip, named <a href="/wiki/Atari_POKEY.html" title="Atari POKEY">POKEY</a>, was responsible for reading the keyboard, generating sound and serial communications (the latter in conjunction with the PIA). It also provided timers, a random number generator (for <a  class="new" title="Sound noise">sound noise</a> as well as random numbers), and maskable interrupts. <i>POKEY</i> has four semi-independent audio channels, each with its own frequency, noise and volume control. Each 8-bit channel had its own audio control register which selected the noise content and volume. For higher sound resolution (quality), two of the audio channels can be combined for more accurate sound (16-bit).</p>
<p>The name POKEY comes from the words "POtentiometer" and "KEYboard", which were two of the I/O devices that POKEY interfaced with. The name POKEY also has a double meaning, because POKEY was a "glue" chip, and one type of glue is made from horses, and Pokey was a famous cartoon horse.</p>
<p>Atari had originally intended to port <a href="/wiki/Microsoft_BASIC.html" title="Microsoft BASIC">Microsoft BASIC</a> to the machine, as had most other vendors, intending to supply it on an 8k ROM cartridge. However the existing 6502 version from Microsoft was 12k, and all of Atari's attempts to pare it down failed. Eventually they farmed out the work to a local consulting firm, who recommended writing their own version from scratch, which was eventually delivered as <a href="/wiki/ATARI_BASIC.html" title="ATARI BASIC">ATARI BASIC</a>.</p>

<h3>The early machines: 400 and 800</h3>
<p>Management identified two <a href="/wiki/Sweet_spot.html" title="Sweet spot">sweet spots</a> for the new computers, a low-end version known as <b>Candy</b>, and a higher-end machine known as <b>Colleen</b> (rumored to be named after attractive Atari staff). The primary difference between the two models was marketing; Atari marketed <i>Colleen</i> as a computer, <i>Candy</i> as a game machine (or hybrid game console). Colleen would include slots for memory and <a href="/wiki/Read-only_memory.html" title="Read-only memory">ROM</a>, a second 8k cartridge slot, <a href="/wiki/Composite_video.html" title="Composite video">monitor output</a> and a full keyboard, while Candy used a plastic "<a href="/wiki/Membrane_keyboard.html" title="Membrane keyboard">membrane keyboard</a>" and internal slots (not user upgradable). Both machines were built like tanks with huge internal aluminum shields, to meet <a href="/wiki/Federal_Communications_Commission.html" title="Federal Communications Commission">FCC</a> rules for TV signals emitted in RF space (Part 15 Type I). Apple machines, without a RF modulator, didn't need to meet those requirements (the first model of the <a href="/wiki/TRS-80.html" title="TRS-80">TRS-80</a> actually never met that FCC spec).</p>

Atari 800</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The machines were announced in December <a href="/wiki/1978.html" title="1978">1978</a> as the <b>400</b> and <b>800</b>, although they weren't widely available until November 1979. The names originally referred to the amount of memory, 4<a href="/wiki/Kilobyte.html" title="Kilobyte">K</a> <a href="/wiki/Random_Access_Memory.html" title="Random Access Memory">RAM</a> in the 400 and 8K in the 800. However by the time they were released the prices on RAM had started to fall, so the machines were instead released with 8K and 16K respectively.</p>
<p>Due to new FCC restrictions, the 400/800 couldn't allow slots like those found on the Apple II computers. Instead, they created a proprietary, expensive serial-based interface called <a  class="new" title="Serial Input/Output">SIO</a> (Serial Input/Output). All external devices were connected using this interface (cassette drive, disk drive, interface box) adding to the cost of ownership. On the 800, the internal slots were reserved for ROM and memory modules. Originally the machines shipped with 16k, but as prices continued to fall Atari eventually supplied the machines fully expanded to 48k, using up all the slots.</p>
<p>A few companies made RAM modules for the Atari 800. One company made a module which added an 80-column display system and 16k of RAM so you could remove one of the Atari-supplied cards without losing memory.</p>
<p>Overheating problems with the memory modules eventually led Atari to remove the casings on the memory modules, leaving them as "bare" boards. Later, the expansion cover was held down with screws instead of latches.</p>
<p>The Atari 800 sold respectably, but not nearly as well as the Apple machines. The crippling of the 400 only confused buyers and a replacement was in the works (the so called Sweet-8 or "Liz NY").</p>

</div>
<p>The 800 was complex and expensive to build, consisting of multiple circuit boards in various locations inside or outside the massive aluminum shield. Additionally the machine was designed to add RAM only through cards, which required expensive connectors and packaging even though it now shipped fully expanded right from the factory. At the same time the 400 didn't compete technically with some of the newer machines appearing in the early 1980s, which tended to ship with much more RAM and a real keyboard.</p>
<p>Another major change was the introduction of the FCC ratings specifically for digital devices in homes and offices. One of the ratings, known as Class B, mandated that the device's RF emissions were to be low enough not to interfere with other devices, such as radios and TVs. Now computers needed just enough shielding to prevent interference (both ways), not prevent emissions from leaking out. This requirement enabled lighter, less expensive shielding than the previous 400 and 800 computers.</p>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/1982.html" title="1982">1982</a> Atari started the <i>Sweet 16</i> project to address these issues. The result was an upgraded set of machines otherwise similar to the 400 and 800, but much easier and less costly to produce. Newer <a href="/wiki/Fab_%28semiconductors%29.html" title="Fab (semiconductors)">fabs</a> allowed a number of chips in the original systems to be condensed into one. For comparison, the original 800 used seven separate circuit boards (many of them small, three of them for RAM and another for ROM), while the new machines used only one. Sweet 16 also addressed problems with the 800 by adding a new expansion chassis as well, although it was to be external. Like the earlier machines, the Sweet 16 was intended to be released in two versions as the <b>1000</b> with 16KB and the <b>1000XL</b> with 64KB. RAM was still expensive enough to make this distinction worthwhile.</p>
<p>When ANTIC needed memory access it halted the CPU. But this required four support chips. Atari later had a custom version of the 6502B to be made with an extra "HALT" pin. Known initially as SALLY, this version later became an official product known as the "6502C" and used in all XL/XE Atari machines.</p>

Atari 1200XL</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>But when the machines were actually released there was only one version, the <b>1200XL</b>, an odd hybrid of features from the Sweet 16 project. Notable features were 64kB of RAM (first for an Atari), built-in self test, redesigned keyboard (featuring four function keys and a HELP key), and redesigned cable port layout. However the 1200XL also included a number of missing or poorly implemented features. For instance it included the expansion chassis connector, but the case did not include a hole for it to be used. An improved video circuit provided more chroma for a more colorful image, but the line was not connected to the monitor port. The +12V pin in the SIO port was not used; only +5V power was available.</p>
<p>The 1200XL was functionally similar to the existing 800, but at a hefty price point. Changes made to the operating system to support the new hardware resulted in compatibility problems with some older software. For all of these reasons the 1200XL sold poorly. There is an often-repeated story, perhaps apocryphal, that 800 sales shot up after the release of the 1200XL, as existing owners tried to snap them up before they disappeared. Released in late 1982, the machine was quickly discontinued in 1983.</p>

<h4>Newer XL machines</h4>
<p>By this point in time Atari was involved in what would soon develop into a full-blown <a href="/wiki/Price_war.html" title="Price war">price war</a>. <a href="/wiki/Jack_Tramiel.html" title="Jack Tramiel">Jack Tramiel</a> of <a href="/wiki/Commodore_International.html" title="Commodore International">Commodore International</a> watched <a href="/wiki/Texas_Instruments.html" title="Texas Instruments">Texas Instruments</a> enter the home computer market, and decided to push them back out by undercutting their prices. TI had undercut Commodore's calculator business only a few years earlier, but this time Tramiel's supply was stronger than TI's, and he could turn the tables. Although Atari had never been a deliberate target of Tramiel's wrath, they, along with the rest of the market, were dragged into "his" price war in order to maintain <a href="/wiki/Market_share.html" title="Market share">market share</a>.</p>
<p>The timing was particularly bad for Atari; the 1200XL was a flop, and the earlier machines were too expensive to produce to be able to compete at the rapidly falling price points. The solution was to replace the 1200XL with a machine that users would again trust, while at the same time lowering the production costs to the point where they could compete with Commodore.</p>
<p>Starting with the 1200XL design as the basis for a new line, Atari engineers were able to add a number of new IC's to take over the functions of many of those remaining in the 1200XL. While the 1200XL fit onto a single board, the new designs were even smaller, simpler, and as a result much less expensive. To reduce cost even further, manufacturing of a new series of machines was set up in the far east.</p>

Atari 800XL</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>These versions, the <b>600XL</b>, <b>800XL</b>, <b>1400XL</b> and <b>1450XLD</b> were announced at the 1983 Summer <a href="/wiki/Consumer_Electronics_Show.html" title="Consumer Electronics Show">CES</a>. These machines had Atari BASIC built into the <a href="/wiki/Read-only_memory.html" title="Read-only memory">ROM</a> of the computer and a <a href="/wiki/Parallel_Bus_Interface_%28PBI%29.html" title="Parallel Bus Interface (PBI)">Parallel Bus Interface (PBI)</a>. The machines looked similar to the 1200XL, but were smaller back to front, the 600 being somewhat smaller than the 800 front-to-back (a reflection of the Sweet 8 project). The 1400 and 1450 both added a built-in 300 baud <a href="/wiki/Modem.html" title="Modem">modem</a> and a <a href="/wiki/Voice_synthesizer.html" title="Voice synthesizer">voice synthesizer</a>, and the 1450XLD also included a built-in double-sided <a href="/wiki/Floppy_disk.html" title="Floppy disk">floppy disk</a> drive in an enlarged case.</p>
<p>Problems with the new production lines delayed the entry of the machines onto the market. Originally intended to replace the 1200XL in mid-83, the machines did not arrive until late in 1983, far fewer than anticipated during the 1983 Christmas season. Nonetheless, the 800XL was the most popular computer sold by Atari. The 1400XL and the 1450XLD had their delivery dates pushed back, first by the priority given to the 600XL/800XL, and later by the <a href="/wiki/Atari_7800.html" title="Atari 7800">3600 System</a>. In the end the 1400XL was eventually cancelled outright, and the 1450XLD so delayed that it would never ship.</p>
<p>By late 1983 the price war that had started the year before was now reaching a crescendo. Although the 600/800 were well positioned in terms of price and features, their entry into the market was so delayed that Commodore was able to take the '83 Christmas season while Atari struggled to get their machines onto the shelves. Combined with the simultaneous effects of the <a href="/wiki/Video_game_crash_of_1983.html" title="Video game crash of 1983">video game crash of 1983</a>, Atari was soon losing millions of dollars a day. Their owners, <a href="/wiki/Warner_Communications.html" title="Warner Communications">Warner Communications</a>, became desperate to sell off the division.</p>

Atari 65XE</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The final machines in the 8-bit series were there <b>65XE</b> and <b>130XE</b>. They were announced in 1985 at the same time as the initial models in the <a href="/wiki/Atari_ST.html" title="Atari ST">Atari ST</a> series: the 130ST and 520ST. The 65XE was the replacement for the 800XL. Originally called the 900XLF, the 65XE was functionally equivalent to the 800XL minus the PBI connection. The 65XE (Euro version) and the 130XE had a <a href="/wiki/Enhanced_Cartridge_Interface_%28ECI%29.html" title="Enhanced Cartridge Interface (ECI)">Enhanced Cartridge Interface (ECI)</a>, a variant of the <a href="/wiki/Parallel_Bus_Interface_%28PBI%29.html" title="Parallel Bus Interface (PBI)">Parallel Bus Interface (PBI)</a>. The 130XE came with 128KB of memory, accessible through bank-selection (thanks to <a href="/wiki/Atari_FREDDIE.html" title="Atari FREDDIE">FREDDIE</a> and a <a href="/wiki/EMMU.html" title="EMMU">EMMU</a> chip). An additional <b>800XE</b> was available in <a href="/wiki/Europe.html" title="Europe">Europe</a> (mostly <a href="/wiki/Eastern_Europe.html" title="Eastern Europe">Eastern Europe</a>), which was essentially a 65XE. <i>XE</i> stood for <i><b>X</b>L-<b>E</b>xpanded</i>.</p>
<p>The reason for repackaging the 130XE into the 800XE was Atari trying to ride on the popularity of the original 800XL in Europe. Unfortunately, 65XE and 800XE machines sold in Eastern Europe had a buggy GTIA chip, specifically those machines made in China in 1991.</p>
<p>The numbers <i>65</i> and <i>130</i> were used for the <i>XE</i> series because Atari based their machine-numbers on the amount of RAM they came with, but, unlike the <a href="/wiki/Commodore_International.html" title="Commodore International">Commodore</a> <i>64</i> and <i>128</i>, Atari decided to use the decimal byte count with a base of 1,000 (sometimes rounded to a more even number) for marketing reasons instead of the traditional base-1,024 used by engineers, as the numbers are larger (64K being 65,536 = 65, instead of 64, and 128K being 131,072, rounded to 130, instead of 128). All subsequent model-numbers used this system, including the 16-bit <a href="/wiki/Atari_ST.html" title="Atari ST">Atari ST</a> line of computers as well. Interestingly this exact scheme was eventually universally adopted by hard drive manufacturers for the same reason.</p>

Atari XE Game System</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Finally, with the resurgence of the gaming industry brought on by <a href="/wiki/Nintendo.html" title="Nintendo">Nintendo</a>, Atari brought out the <b>XE Game System (XEGS)</b>, released in 1987. The XEGS was sold bundled with its detachable keyboard (first for an Atari computer), a joystick and a lightgun (<a href="/wiki/XG-1.html" title="XG-1">XG-1</a>), and a couple of game cartridges. No <b>PBI</b> or <b>ECI</b>, but a complete computer with the keyboard. Bad marketing and a lack of newer releases hampered sales.</p>
<p>On January 1, 1992, Atari Corp. officially dropped all remaining support of their 8-bit line.</p>

<h2>Peripherals</h2>
<p>Atari's peripherals were named after the machines they were intended to be used with, so in general they have names like "410" and "1050". All of them used the proprietary SIO port, which allowed them to be <a href="/wiki/Daisy_chain.html" title="Daisy chain">daisy chained</a> together into a single string; a method also used in Commodore's home computers from the <a href="/wiki/Commodore_VIC-20.html" title="Commodore VIC-20">VIC-20</a> onwards. These "intelligent" peripherials were more expensive than the standard IBM PC devices, which did not need the added SIO electronics.</p>

<p>The Atari 8-bit computers came with an operating system built into the <a href="/wiki/Read-only_memory.html" title="Read-only memory">ROM</a>. The Atari 400/800 had the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>OS Rev. A - 10K ROM (3 chips) early machines.</li>
<li>OS Rev. B - 10K ROM (3 chips) bug fixes. Most common for 400/800.</li>
</ul>
<p>The XL/XE Atari 8-bit models all had OS revisions due to added hardware features and changes. But this created compatibility issues with some of the older software. Atari responded with the Translator Disk, a floppy disk which loaded the older 400/800 Rev. B or Rev. A OS into the XL/XE computers.</p>
<ul>
<li>OS Rev. 10 - 16K ROM (2 chips) for 1200XL Rev A</li>

<li>OS Rev. 2 - 16K ROM for 800XL</li>
<li>OS Rev. 3 - 16K ROM for 800XE/130XE</li>
<li>OS Rev. 4 - 32K ROM (16K OS + 8K BASIC + 8K Missile Command) for XEGS</li>
</ul>

<p><a name="Standard_modes" id="Standard_modes"></a></p>
<h3>Standard modes</h3>
<p>While the ANTIC and GTIA chips allowed a variety of graphics modes to be combined, and different playfield widths to be used, the Atari's Operating System provided a basic set of graphics modes. In most cases, these were exposed to Atari BASIC via the "GRAPHICS" command, and to some other languages, via similar system calls.</p>
<ul>
<li>40×24 text modes
<ul>
<li>1 color of text, with each character's 8×8 pixels the same size as those in 320×192 graphics mode, with the same hue restriction. Characters with the high-bit on were represented in inverse-video.</li>
<li>"Lowercase with descenders" mode, which was not available through GRAPHICS, only as part of custom display lists. In this mode characters were 10 pixels high and occupied either the upper or lower 8 pixels of that height. This was not strictly speaking a 40×24 text mode, because of the unusual height.</li>
<li>Colored text, where every two bits represents a colored pixel (characters were 4×8 pixels that were the same size as those in 160×192 graphics mode). Characters with the high-bit on were displayed using a 5th color palette registered where the 4th would normally be used.</li>
<li>Colored text, where every four bits represents a colored pixel (characters were 2×8 pixels that were the same size as those in 80×192 graphics mode and had the same color limitations). This mode was not directly available through GRAPHICS but required setting GTIA flags in text mode.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>20×24 text mode
<ul>
<li>1 color of text, with each character's 8×8 pixels the same size as those in 160×192 graphics mode. Characters with various bits enabled or disabled (which would normally appear as 'control-characters', lower-case characters, or inverse-video) were displayed with different colored pixels.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>20×12 text mode
<ul>
<li>(Same as 20×24 text mode, but with larger pixels and fewer rows of text)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>40×24 graphics mode — 4 colors (2 bpp)</li>
<li>80×48 graphics modes — Either 2 colors (1 bpp), or 4 colors (2 bpp)</li>
<li>160×96 graphics modes — Either 2 colors, or 4 colors</li>
<li>160×192 graphics modes — Either 2 colors, or 4 colors</li>
<li>320×192 graphics mode — 2 colors (1 bpp). The pixels were a shade of the playfield color, and could not be different hue.</li>
<li>80×192 graphics modes (GTIA chip only)
<ul>
<li>9 colors from the color palette registers</li>
<li>All 15 Atari hues, but only of one brightness (plus black)</li>
<li>All 16 Atari shades, but only of one hue</li>
</ul>
</li>

<h3>Software-driven modes</h3>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/1992.html" title="1992">1992</a>, <a  class="new" title="Jeff D. Potter">Jeff D. Potter</a> created a <a href="/wiki/GIF.html" title="GIF">GIF</a> decoder and image viewer for the Atari called <i>APACView</i>. APAC, or <a href="/wiki/Any_Point%2C_Any_Color.html" title="Any Point, Any Color">Any Point, Any Color</a>, was a software-driven method of display an image using all 256 of the Atari's possible colors. By taking 80×192 mode lines that displayed 16 hues, and those that displayed 16 shades, and either interlacing rows of them, quickly alternating between rows of them, or both, a screen displaying 80×96 or 80×192 pixels in 256 colors could be perceived.</p>
<p>Later, Potter created another <a href="/wiki/GIF.html" title="GIF">GIF</a> decoder, and later a <a href="/wiki/JPEG.html" title="JPEG">JPEG</a> decoder was created, which broke an image into the three red, green and blue channels. 16 shades of each, at 80×192 pixels, would be displayed in an interlaced and flickering fashion. The human eye's <a href="/wiki/Persistence_of_vision.html" title="Persistence of vision">persistence of vision</a> would allow the viewer to see 4096 colors (12 bpp) at 80×192, with slight 'rolling' artifacts in solid red, green or blue fields in the image. This was called <a  class="new" title="ColrView">ColrView</a> mode.</p>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/1994.html" title="1994">1994</a>, <a  class="new" title="Clay Halliwell">Clay Halliwell</a> created a modem terminal program for the Atari (<i>FlickerTerm80</i>) which uses 40×24 text mode, combined with two character sets with an identical 4×8 <a href="/wiki/Font.html" title="Font">font</a> — one with the pixels on the left half of the 8×8 grid, the other on the right. By altering where in memory ANTIC looks for graphics, and which font to display, an 80×24 character screen can be displayed. It uses less memory (about 2&#160;KiB) and can be more quickly manipulated, compared to rendering 80×24 characters using a 320×192 bitmap mode (which would require about 8&#160;KiB).</p>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/1998.html" title="1998">1998</a>, Bill Kendrick created a puzzle video game for the Atari (<i>Gem Drop</i>) which utilized a similar effect, but by using two alternating character sets (<a href="/wiki/Font.html" title="Font">fonts</a>) in colored text. (Each character is 4×8 pixels, each pixel being one of 4 colors.) No color palette changes occurred, and ANTIC's <a  class="new" title="Display List">Display List</a> wasn't altered — only a <a href="/wiki/Vertical_blank_interrupt.html" title="Vertical blank interrupt">vertical blank interrupt</a> was used to change the character set. This allowed for approximately 13 colors on the screen. Solid color fields that were based on two actual colors (e.g., dark red created by flickering between red and black) had less artifacting because they could be drawn in a <a href="/wiki/Checkerboard.html" title="Checkerboard">checkerboard</a> fashion. This mode was called <a  class="new" title="SuperIRG">SuperIRG</a>. (Normal 4×8 multi-colored text on the Atari is called <a href="/wiki/IRG.html" title="IRG">IRG</a>.)</p>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/1996.html" title="1996">1996</a>, Atari <a href="/wiki/Demoscene.html" title="Demoscene">demo coders</a> <a  class="new" title="HARD Software">HARD Software</a> from <a href="/wiki/Hungary.html" title="Hungary">Hungary</a> created <a  class="new" title="HARD Interlacing Picture">HARD Interlacing Picture</a> (HIP), which can display 160×192 pixels in 30 shades of grey. It interlaces two modes — 80×192 with 16 shades of grey, 80×192 with 9 paletted colors — and utilizes a bug in the GTIA chip that causes one of the modes to be shifted ½ pixel, allowing for a perceived 160 pixels across.</p>
<p>Later, other demo coders created RIP graphics mode, which is similar to HIP, but can display 160×192 pixels in color.</p>
