Irish presidential standard,<br />
adopted in 1945</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The President is formally elected by the people once every seven years, except in the event of premature vacancy, when an election must be held within sixty days. The President is directly elected by secret ballot under the <a href="/wiki/Alternative_Vote.html" title="Alternative Vote">Alternative Vote</a> form of the Single Transferable Vote system<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a  title="">[1]</a></sup>. While both Irish and <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom.html" title="United Kingdom">UK</a> citizens resident in the state may vote in elections to <a href="/wiki/D%C3%A1il_%C3%89ireann.html" title="Dáil Éireann">Dáil Éireann</a> (the lower house of parliament), only Irish citizens, who must be at least eighteen years of age, may vote in the election of the President. The presidency is open to all citizens of the state who are at least 35. A candidate must, however be nominated by one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>At least twenty members of the <a href="/wiki/Oireachtas.html" title="Oireachtas">Oireachtas</a> (national parliament).</li>
<li>At least four <a href="/wiki/County_council.html" title="County council">county</a> or <a href="/wiki/County_borough.html" title="County borough">city</a> councils.</li>
<li>Themselves (in the case of an incumbent or former president).</li>
</ul>
<p>Where only one candidate is nominated, he or she is deemed elected without the need for a ballot. For this reason, where there is a consensus among political parties not to have a contest, the President may be 'elected' without the occurrence of an actual ballot. Since the establishment of the office this has occurred on six occasions. No one may be elected as President more than twice.</p>
<p>Under the wording of the constitution and the relevant <a href="/wiki/Statute_law.html" title="Statute law">statute law</a> a candidate's election formally takes place in the form of a 'declaration' by the returning officer. Where more than one candidate is nominated, the election is 'suspended' so that a ballot can take place, allowing the electors to choose between candidates.</p>

<h2>Ordinary duties and functions</h2>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Constitution_of_Ireland.html" title="Constitution of Ireland">Constitution of Ireland</a> provides for a <a href="/wiki/Parliamentary_system.html" title="Parliamentary system">parliamentary system</a> of government, under which the role of the head of state is largely a ceremonial one. Most of the functions of the President may only be carried out in accordance with the strict instructions of the Constitution, or the binding 'advice' of the <a href="/wiki/Irish_Government.html" title="Irish Government">Government</a>. The President does, however, possess certain personal powers, that may be exercised at her discretion. Unlike the presidents of many other republics, the President of Ireland is neither the nominal nor <i>de facto</i> chief executive officer of the state. Rather, executive authority is expressly vested in the Government (cabinet). The Government is obliged, however, to keep the President generally informed on matters of domestic and foreign policy.</p>

<p><a name="Ceremonial_functions" id="Ceremonial_functions"></a></p>
<h3>Ceremonial functions</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Appoints the Government:</b> The President appoints the <a href="/wiki/Taoiseach.html" title="Taoiseach">Taoiseach</a> (head of government) and other ministers, and accepts their resignations. The Taoiseach is appointed upon the nomination of <a href="/wiki/D%C3%A1il_%C3%89ireann.html" title="Dáil Éireann">Dáil Éireann</a> (the lower house of parliament), and the remainder of the cabinet upon the nomination of the Taoiseach. Ministers are dimissed on the advice of the Taoiseach and the Taoiseach must, unless there is a dissolution of the Dáil, resign upon losing the confidence of the house. On the advice of the Government, the President also appoints members of the judiciary.</li>
<li><b>Convenes and dissolves Dáil Éireann:</b> Save where exercising the right, under his or her reserve powers, to refuse a dissolution in certain circumstances, this power is exercised on the advice of the Government.</li>
<li><b>Signs bills into law:</b> The president is formally one of three tiers of the <a href="/wiki/Oireachtas.html" title="Oireachtas">Oireachtas</a> (national parliament). The President may not, unless exercising one of her reserve powers, veto a law that the Dáil and the <a href="/wiki/Seanad_%C3%89ireann.html" title="Seanad Éireann">Senate</a> have adopted.</li>
<li><b>Represents the state in foreign affairs:</b> This power is exercised only on the advice of the Government. The President accredits ambassadors and receives the letters of credence of foreign diplomats. Ministers sign international treaties in the President's name. This role was not exercised by the President prior to 1949, see <a  title="">Irish head of state from 1937-1949</a>.</li>
<li>Is <b>supreme commander</b> of the <a href="/wiki/Irish_Defence_Forces.html" title="Irish Defence Forces">Defence Forces</a>, in this role somewhat similar in statute to that of a <a href="/wiki/Commander-in-chief.html" title="Commander-in-chief">commander-in-chief</a>. This is a nominal position, the powers of which are exercised on the advice of the Government. See <a href="/wiki/Minister_for_Defence_%28Ireland%29.html" title="Minister for Defence (Ireland)">Minister for Defense</a>.</li>
<li><b>Power of pardon:</b> The President, on the advice of the Government, has "the right of pardon and the power to commute or remit punishment". This power has only being used once, in the case of the <a href="/wiki/Sallins_Train_Robbery.html" title="Sallins Train Robbery">Sallins Train Robbery</a>; it had been announced by the Irish Government that it would be used to pardon the so called <a href="/wiki/Provisional_Irish_Republican_Army.html" title="Provisional Irish Republican Army">IRA</a> 'on the runs' as part of the <a href="/wiki/Northern_Ireland_peace_process.html" title="Northern Ireland peace process">Northern Ireland peace process</a>, but the Government later abandoned this plan after the British Government similarly abandoned a <i>de facto</i> amnesty for 'on the runs'.</li>

<h3>Special limitations</h3>
<ul>
<li>The President may not leave the state without the consent of the Government.</li>
<li>Every formal address or message "to the nation" or to either or both Houses of the Oireachtas must have prior approval of the Government. Other than on these two (quite rare) occasions there is no limitation on the President's right to speak. While earlier presidents were exceptionally cautious in delivering speeches and on almost every occasion submitted them for vetting, presidents <a href="/wiki/Mary_Robinson.html" title="Mary Robinson">Mary Robinson</a> and Mary McAleese have made much more use of their right to speak without government approval, with Mary McAleese doing many live radio and television interviews. Nonetheless, by convention Presidents refrain from direct criticism of the government.</li>

<h2>Discretionary powers</h2>
<p>The President possesses the following powers which he/she may exercise at his/her absolute discretion. It is required that, before exercising certain reserve powers, the President consult the <a href="/wiki/Council_of_State_%28Ireland%29.html" title="Council of State (Ireland)">Council of State</a>. However, the President is not compelled to act in accordance with the council's advice.</p>

The historic <a href="/wiki/Blue_Hussars.html" title="Blue Hussars">Blue Hussars</a> assembled at the inauguration of <a href="/wiki/Douglas_Hyde.html" title="Douglas Hyde">Douglas Hyde</a> as first President of Ireland, in June 1938.<br />

</div>
</div>
<p>Presidents may refuse to grant a dissolution of <a href="/wiki/D%C3%A1il_%C3%89ireann.html" title="Dáil Éireann">Dáil Éireann</a> to a <a href="/wiki/Taoiseach.html" title="Taoiseach">Taoiseach</a> who has "ceased to retain the support of a majority" of the house. In such an event, the Taoiseach must resign immediately. This power has never been invoked but the necessary circumstances existed in 1944, 1982 and 1994.</p>
<p>Since this power must be exercised by the President's "absolute discretion" according to the English language version of the constitution, or, under the Irish language wording of the constitution <i>as a chomhairle féin</i> which is usually translated as "under his own counsel", it is considered inappropriate for the president to be contacted by the leaders of any political parties in an effort to influence his or her decision.</p>
<p>In the event of a clash between the Irish and English versions of the constitution, the Irish one is given supremacy. Lawyers have suggested that a clash may exist in this case between both versions of the constitution. While "absolute discretion" appears to leave some freedom for manouvre for a president in deciding whether to initiate contact with the opposition, "under his own counsel" has been interpreted by some lawyers as suggesting that <i>no</i> contact whatsoever can take place. This apparent discrepancy in wording has discouraged presidents from contemplating the use of the power and led to an ultra-strict application of a policy of non-contact with the opposition, most notably in January 1982 when <a href="/wiki/Patrick_Hillery.html" title="Patrick Hillery">President Hillery</a> instructed an aide, Captain Anthony Barber, to ensure that no telephone calls from the opposition were to be passed on to him. (Nevertheless three opposition figures, including <a href="/wiki/Fianna_F%C3%A1il.html" title="Fianna Fáil">Fianna Fáil</a> leader <a href="/wiki/Charles_Haughey.html" title="Charles Haughey">Charles Haughey</a>, demanded to be put through to Hillery, with Haughey threatening to end Barber's career if the calls weren't put though. Hillery, as Commander-in-Chief of the Defence Forces, recorded the threat in Barber's file and recorded that Barber had been acting on his instructions in refusing the call<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a  title="">[2]</a></sup>).</p>

<p><a name="Reference_of_bills_to_the_people" id="Reference_of_bills_to_the_people"></a></p>
<h3>Reference of bills to the people</h3>
<p>If requested to do so by a petition signed by a majority of the membership of the Senate, and one-third of the membership of the Dáil, the President may, after consultation with the Council of State, decline to sign a bill (other than a bill to amend the constitution) she considers to be of great "national importance" into law until it has been approved by either:</p>
<ul>
<li>The people in an <a href="/wiki/Ordinary_referendum.html" title="Ordinary referendum">ordinary referendum</a>.</li>
<li>The Dáil reassembling after a general election, held within eight months.</li>
</ul>
<p>This power has never been used due to the fact that the government almost always commands a majority of the senate preventing the third of Dáil Éireann that usually makes up the opposition from combining with it.</p>

<h3>Other</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Reference of bills to the Supreme Court:</b> The President may, upon consultation with the Council of State, refer a bill to the <a href="/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_Republic_of_Ireland.html" title="Supreme Court of the Republic of Ireland">Supreme Court</a> to test its constitutionality. The Supreme Court then tests its constitutionality <i>in toto</i> and the President may not sign the bill into law if it is found to be unconstitutional. This is the most widely used reserve power and was indeed used by six of the eight presidents (most frequently by presidents <a href="/wiki/Patrick_Hillery.html" title="Patrick Hillery">Patrick Hillery</a> and <a href="/wiki/Mary_Robinson.html" title="Mary Robinson">Mary Robinson</a>), but this power may not be applied to: a <a href="/wiki/Money_bill.html" title="Money bill">money bill</a>, a bill to amend the Constitution, or an urgent bill the time for the consideration of which has been abridged in the <a href="/wiki/Seanad_%C3%89ireann.html" title="Seanad Éireann">Senate</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Abridgement of the time for bills in the Senate:</b> The President may, at the request of Dáil Éireann, and after consultation with the Council of State, impose a time-limit on the period during which the <a href="/wiki/Seanad_%C3%89ireann.html" title="Seanad Éireann">Senate</a> may consider a bill. The effect of this power is to restrict the power of the Senate to delay a bill that the Government considers urgent.</li>

<p>The President of Ireland has no <a href="/wiki/Vice_president.html" title="Vice president">vice president</a>. In the event of a premature vacancy a successor must be elected within sixty days. In the interim the duties and functions of the office are carried out by a collective vice-presidency known as the <a href="/wiki/Presidential_Commission_%28Ireland%29.html" title="Presidential Commission (Ireland)">Presidential Commission</a>, consisting of the <a href="/wiki/Chief_Justice_of_Ireland.html" title="Chief Justice of Ireland">Chief Justice</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Ceann_Comhairle.html" title="Ceann Comhairle">Ceann Comhairle</a> (speaker) of Dáil Éireann, and the <a href="/wiki/Cathaoirleach.html" title="Cathaoirleach">Cathaoirleach</a> (chairperson) of the Senate. Since 1937 the Presidential Commission has taken the place of the President on a number of occasions.</p>
<p>Technically each president's term of office expires at midnight on the day before the new president's inauguration. Therefore, between midnight and the inauguration the following day the presidential duties and functions are carried out by the Presidential Commission.</p>
<p>The constitution also empowers the Council of State, acting by a majority of its members, to "make such provision as to them may seem meet" for the exercise of the duties of the president in any contingency the constitution does not foresee. The Council of State can therefore be considered the third in the line of succession. However, to date, it has never been necessary for the council to take up this role.</p>

<p>Under the constitution, in assuming office the President must subscribe to a formal declaration, made publicly and in the presence of members of both Houses of the Oireachtas, Judges of the Supreme Court and of the High Court, and other "public personages". The <a href="/wiki/Inauguration_of_the_President_of_Ireland.html" title="Inauguration of the President of Ireland">inauguration of the President</a> takes place in St Patrick's Hall in <a href="/wiki/Dublin_Castle.html" title="Dublin Castle">Dublin Castle</a>.

<p>The constitution provides for just two ways in which the President may be removed from office prior to the expiration of his or her term. The President can be removed from office if the Supreme Court, in a sitting of at least five judges, finds that he or she has become "permanently incapacitated". Alternatively the President may be removed from office by the houses of the Oireachtas, but only for "stated misbehaviour". Either house of the Oireachtas may <a href="/wiki/Impeachment.html" title="Impeachment">impeach</a> the President but only by a resolution approved by a majority of at least two-thirds, and a house may not consider a proposal for impeachment unless requested to do so by at least thirty of its members. Where one house impeaches the President, the remaining house investigates the charge or commissions another body or committee to do so. The investigating house can remove the President if it decides, by at least a two-thirds majority, that the President is guilty of the charge of which he or she is accused, and that the charge is sufficiently serious as to warrant his or her removal. To date neither procedure for the removal of the President has yet been invoked.</p>

<h2>Security and transport</h2>
<p>As head of state of the Republic of Ireland, the President receives the highest level of protection in the land. The Aras is protected by armed guards at all times and is encircled by security fencing. At all times the President travels with an armed security detail which is provided by the Special branch (an elite wing of the Irish police force). The Presidential Limousine is a Mercedes-Benz S-Class LWB. The Presidential Limousine is always navy blue and carries the Presidential standard on the left front wing and the tricolor on the right front wing. When traveling the Presidential Limousine is always accompanied by support cars (normally Toyota Camrys driven by members of the Special Branch) which form a protective convoy around the car. The President also has the full use of all Irish Air Corps aircraft at his/her disposal if so needed.</p>

<p>The office of President of Ireland was established in 1937, in part as a replacement for the office of <a href="/wiki/Governor-General_of_the_Irish_Free_State.html" title="Governor-General of the Irish Free State">Governor-General</a> that existed during the <a href="/wiki/1922.html" title="1922">1922</a>-1937 <a href="/wiki/Irish_Free_State.html" title="Irish Free State">Irish Free State</a>. The seven year term of office of the President was inspired by those of the presidents of <a href="/wiki/Germany.html" title="Germany">Germany</a> and <a href="/wiki/Austria.html" title="Austria">Austria</a>. However the head of state of neither of those two nations serves a seven year term today. At the time the office was established critics warned that the post might lead to the emergence of a dictatorship. However these fears were not borne out as successive Presidents played a limited, largely apolitical role in national affairs.</p>
<p>Many argue that Mary Robinson, the seventh President of Ireland, liberalised what had previously been a conservative office during her term from 1990-1997. Robinson sought to develop a new sense of the states's economic, political and cultural links with other countries and cultures, especially those of the <a href="/wiki/Irish_diaspora.html" title="Irish diaspora">Irish diaspora</a>. She placed emphasis during her presidency on the needs of developing countries, linking the history of the <a href="/wiki/Irish_potato_famine.html" title="Irish potato famine">Great Irish Famine</a> to today's nutrition, poverty and policy issues, attempting to create a bridge of partnership between developed and developing countries.</p>
<p>Robinson was the first head of state to visit <a href="/wiki/Rwanda.html" title="Rwanda">Rwanda</a> in the aftermath of the <a href="/wiki/1994.html" title="1994">1994</a> genocide there. She was also the first head of state to visit <a href="/wiki/Somalia.html" title="Somalia">Somalia</a> following the crisis there in <a href="/wiki/1992.html" title="1992">1992</a>, receiving the CARE Humanitarian Award in recognition of her efforts for that country.</p>

<p>The original text of the Constitution of Ireland, as adopted in 1937, in its controversial <a href="/wiki/Articles_2_and_3.html" title="Articles 2 and 3">Articles 2 and 3</a>, mentioned two geopolitical entities, a thirty-two county 'national territory' (i.e., the island of <a href="/wiki/Ireland.html" title="Ireland">Ireland</a>) and a twenty-six county 'state' formerly known as the <a href="/wiki/Irish_Free_State.html" title="Irish Free State">Irish Free State</a> (Articles 2 and 3 have since been amended). The implication behind the title 'President of Ireland' was that the President would function as the head of all Ireland. However this implication was challenged by the <a href="/wiki/Ulster_Unionists.html" title="Ulster Unionists">Ulster Unionists</a> and the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom.html" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland</a> which was the state internationally acknowledged as having jurisdiction over <a href="/wiki/Northern_Ireland.html" title="Northern Ireland">Northern Ireland</a>.</p>
<p>Ireland in turn challenged the proclamation by the British parliament of <a href="/wiki/Elizabeth_II_of_the_United_Kingdom.html" title="Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom">Queen Elizabeth II</a> in 1952 as 'queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland'. The government of the <a href="/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland.html" title="Republic of Ireland">Republic of Ireland</a> refused to attend royal functions as a result; for example, President Hillery (1976–90) declined on Government advice to attend the wedding of the <a href="/wiki/Charles%2C_Prince_of_Wales.html" title="Charles, Prince of Wales">Prince of Wales</a> to the late <a href="/wiki/Diana%2C_Princess_of_Wales.html" title="Diana, Princess of Wales">Lady Diana Spencer</a> in 1981, to which he had been invited by Queen Elizabeth, while President Sean T. Ó Ceallaigh declined on government advice to attend the Coronation Garden Party at the British Embassy in 1953. Britain in turn insisted on referring to the President as 'President of the Republic of Ireland' or 'President of the Irish Republic.' Letters of Credence from Queen Elizabeth, on the <a href="/wiki/British_government.html" title="British government">British government</a>'s advice, appointing United Kingdom ambassadors to Ireland were not addressed to the 'President of Ireland' but to the president personally (for example: 'President Hillery').</p>
<p>This dispute has largely been forgotten in recent years. President Robinson (1990–97) chose unilaterally to break the taboo by regularly visiting <a href="/wiki/England.html" title="England">England</a> for public functions, frequently to do with <a href="/wiki/Anglo-Irish_Relations.html" title="Anglo-Irish Relations">Anglo-Irish Relations</a> or to visit the Irish emigrant community in Britain. In another breaking of precedent, she was invited to <a href="/wiki/Buckingham_Palace.html" title="Buckingham Palace">Buckingham Palace</a> by Queen Elizabeth II. Interestingly, the Palace accreditation supplied to journalists covering the history-making visit referred to the "visit of the President of Ireland".<sup title="The text in the vicinity of this tag needs citation." class="noprint">[<a  title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><i>citation&#160;needed</i></a>]</sup> In recent times, both Presidents Robinson and her successor Mary McAleese (1997— ) have visited the Palace on numerous occasions, while the Prince of Wales, Duke of York, Earl of Wessex and Duke of Edinburgh have all visited successive presidents of Ireland in <a href="/wiki/%C3%81ras_an_Uachtar%C3%A1in.html" title="Áras an Uachtaráin">Áras an Uachtaráin</a> (the presidential palace). Presidents have also have attended functions with the Princess Royal. Her Majesty the Queen and Her Excellency the President even jointly hosted a reception in St. James's Palace in London in 1995, to commemorate the one hundred and fiftieth anniversary of the foundation of the Queen's Colleges in 1845 (the Queen's Colleges are now known as <a href="/wiki/Queen%27s_University_of_Belfast.html" title="Queen's University of Belfast">Queen's University of Belfast</a>, <a href="/wiki/University_College_Cork_-_National_University_of_Ireland%2C_Cork.html" title="University College Cork - National University of Ireland, Cork">University College Cork - National University of Ireland, Cork</a> and <a href="/wiki/National_University_of_Ireland%2C_Galway.html" title="National University of Ireland, Galway">National University of Ireland, Galway</a> (formerly University College, Galway).).</p>
<p>Though the president's title implicitly claimed authority in Northern Ireland, in reality the Irish President needed government permission to visit Northern Ireland. (The Irish state in Article 3 explicitly stated that "pending the re-integration of the national territory" its authority was limited to the Republic of Ireland and did not apply to Northern Ireland. Presidents up to the presidency of Mary Robinson (1990–97) were regularly refused permission by the Government of the Republic of Ireland to visit Northern Ireland.)</p>
<p>However, since the 1990s and in particular since the <a href="/wiki/Good_Friday_Agreement.html" title="Good Friday Agreement">Good Friday Agreement</a>, the president has regularly visited Northern Ireland. The current president, Mary McAleese, who is herself the first President of Ireland from Northern Ireland, continues on from Mary Robinson in this regard. In a sign of the warmth of the modern Anglo-Irish Relationship, she has been warmly welcomed by most leading <a href="/wiki/Unionists_%28Ireland%29.html" title="Unionists (Ireland)">unionists</a>. At the funeral for a child murdered by the <a href="/wiki/Real_IRA.html" title="Real IRA">Real IRA</a> in <a href="/wiki/Omagh.html" title="Omagh">Omagh</a> she symbolically walked up the main aisle of the <a href="/wiki/Church.html" title="Church">church</a> hand-in-hand with the <a href="/wiki/Ulster_Unionist_Party.html" title="Ulster Unionist Party">Ulster Unionist Party</a> leader and <a href="/wiki/First_Minister_of_Northern_Ireland.html" title="First Minister of Northern Ireland">First Minister of Northern Ireland</a>, <a href="/wiki/David_Trimble.html" title="David Trimble">David Trimble</a>, MP. Similarly when Queen Elizabeth II visited the <a href="/wiki/Parliament_Buildings_%28Northern_Ireland%29.html" title="Parliament Buildings (Northern Ireland)">Stormont Parliament Buildings</a> on a trip to Northern Ireland as part of her <a href="/wiki/Golden_Jubilee.html" title="Golden Jubilee">Golden Jubilee</a> Tour in 2002, and spoke of the sense of Irish identity of northern nationalists, <a href="/wiki/Sinn_F%C3%A9in.html" title="Sinn Féin">Sinn Féin</a> chose not to launch any public pickets or protests, stating that the Queen, as a symbol cherished by unionists, was entitled to visit.</p>
<p>Despite the changes to Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution as part of the Good Friday Agreement the title of the office remains the "President of Ireland", though there is now little dispute that the Presidency only has jurisdiction over the <i>Republic of</i> Ireland. However she is regarded by many northern nationalists as their President, and plans have been mooted to extend voting rights in Presidential elections to the whole island.</p>

<h3>Who was head of state from 1937-1949?</h3>
<p><i>Main article: <a href="/wiki/Irish_head_of_state_from_1936-1949.html" title="Irish head of state from 1936-1949">Irish head of state from 1936-1949</a></i></p>
<p>During the period of 1937 to <a href="/wiki/1949.html" title="1949">1949</a> it was unclear whether the Irish head of state was actually the President of Ireland or <a href="/wiki/George_VI_of_the_United_Kingdom.html" title="George VI of the United Kingdom">George VI</a>, the <a href="/wiki/King_of_Ireland.html" title="King of Ireland">King of Ireland</a>. This period of confusion ended in 1949 when the state was declared to be a <a href="/wiki/Republic.html" title="Republic">republic</a>.</p>
<p>The 1937 constitution did not mention the king but nor did it state that the President was head of state. The President exercised some powers that could be exercised by heads of state but which could also be exercised by governors or governors-general, such as appointing the Government and promulgating the law. However in 1936 George VI had been declared "King of Ireland" and, under the <a href="/wiki/External_Relations_Act.html" title="External Relations Act">External Relations Act</a> of the same year, it was this king who represented the state in its foreign affairs. Treaties, therefore, were signed in the name of the 'King of Ireland', who also accredited ambassadors and received the letters of credence of foreign diplomats. Representing a state abroad is seen by many scholars as <i>the</i> key characteristic of a head of state. This role meant, in any case, that George VI was the Irish head of state in the eyes of foreign nations. The <a href="/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland_Act.html" title="Republic of Ireland Act">Republic of Ireland Act</a>, which came into force in April 1949, proclaimed a republic and transferred the role of representing the state abroad from George VI to the President. No change was made to the constitution.</p>

<p><a name="Suggestions_for_reform" id="Suggestions_for_reform"></a></p>
<h3>Suggestions for reform</h3>
<p>There have been many suggestions for reforming the office of President over the years. In <a href="/wiki/1996.html" title="1996">1996</a>, the Constitutional Review Group recommended that the office of President should remain largely unchanged. However it suggested that the constitution should be amended to explicitly declare the President to be head of state (at present the term does not appear in the text) and that consideration be given to the introduction of a <a href="/wiki/Constructive_vote_of_no_confidence.html" title="Constructive vote of no confidence">constructive vote of no confidence</a> system in the Dáil, along the lines of that in <a href="/wiki/Germany.html" title="Germany">Germany</a>. If this system were introduced then the power of the President to refuse a Dáil dissolution would be largely redundant and could be taken away.</p>
<p>Due to the lack of a presidential election in <a href="/wiki/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>, many politicians said it should be made easier to gain nomination for the presidency. The <a href="/wiki/T%C3%A1naiste.html" title="Tánaiste">Tánaiste</a>, <a href="/wiki/Mary_Harney.html" title="Mary Harney">Mary Harney</a>, suggested that five to ten TDs or Senators should be able to nominate a candidate, instead of the current twenty required.</p>

<ol class="references">
<li id="_note-0"><b><a  title="">^</a></b> The <a href="/wiki/Single_Transferable_Vote.html" title="Single Transferable Vote">Single Transferable Vote</a> (STV) is also used in elections to Dáil Éireann, when it is known as <i><a href="/wiki/Proportional_representation.html" title="Proportional representation">proportional representation</a> by means of the Single Transferable Vote</i> (PR-STV). However, when, as in a presidential election, it is used for the election of just a single candidate, STV is one and the same as the <a href="/wiki/Instant-runoff_voting.html" title="Instant-runoff voting">Alternative Vote</a> system. There are important differences between PR-STV and the Alternative Vote. The term the "Alternative Vote" is, however, rarely used in Ireland. The President is usually simply said to be elected by STV or, incorrectly, by "proportional representation". While the constitution itself states that the President is elected under the system of "proportional representation by means of the single transferable vote" (Article 12.2.3) this is technically incorrect, because the term <i>proportional representation</i> can only meaningfully be applied to an election in which more than a single candidate is returned. Both the Constitution Review Group and the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution have therefore recommended that the words <i>proprotional representation</i> be deleted from the article that provides for the election of the President.</li>
