<p>On <a href="/wiki/March_6.html" title="March 6">March 6</a>, <a href="/wiki/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a>, the <a href="/wiki/SCO_Group.html" title="SCO Group">SCO Group</a> (formerly known as Caldera Systems) filed a $1 billion <a href="/wiki/Lawsuit.html" title="Lawsuit">lawsuit</a> in the <a href="/wiki/United_States.html" title="United States">US</a> against <a href="/wiki/International_Business_Machines.html" title="International Business Machines">IBM</a> for allegedly “devaluing” its version of the <a href="/wiki/Unix.html" title="Unix">UNIX</a> operating system. The amount of alleged damages was later increased to $3 billion, and then $5 billion. SCO claimed that IBM had, without authorization, contributed SCO's <a href="/wiki/Intellectual_property.html" title="Intellectual property">intellectual property</a> to the codebase of the <a href="/wiki/Open_source.html" title="Open source">open source</a>, <a href="/wiki/Unix-like.html" title="Unix-like">Unix-like</a> <a href="/wiki/Linux.html" title="Linux">Linux</a> operating system. In May 2003 SCO Group sent letters to members of the <a href="/wiki/Fortune_1000.html" title="Fortune 1000">Fortune 1000</a> and <a href="/wiki/Global_500.html" title="Global 500">Global 500</a> companies warning them of the possibility of liability if they use Linux. Because of this, the <a href="/wiki/Stock.html" title="Stock">stock</a> price of SCO's stock (<a href="/wiki/Nasdaq.html" title="Nasdaq">Nasdaq</a> stock symbol SCOX) skyrocketed to around $20 in October of 2003, although it quickly returned to just under $5 per share, very near its original, pre-lawsuit level. For more information, see <a  class="external text" title="http://finance.yahoo.com/q/hp?s=SCOX&amp;a=02&amp;b=21&amp;c=2000&amp;d=01&amp;e=24&amp;f=2005&amp;g=m">this table</a> (courtesy <a href="/wiki/Yahoo%21.html" title="Yahoo!">Yahoo!</a>), showing SCOX stock price history.</p>
<p>Since then, the claims and counter-claims made by both sides have escalated, with both IBM and Linux distributor <a href="/wiki/Red_Hat.html" title="Red Hat">Red Hat</a> starting legal action against SCO, SCO making threatening remarks toward Linux users who do not take out SCO UNIX <a href="/wiki/License.html" title="License">licenses</a>, and SCO starting lawsuits against <a href="/wiki/Novell.html" title="Novell">Novell</a> (see also <a href="/wiki/Linux#SCO_Litigation.html" title="Linux">Linux#SCO Litigation</a>), <a href="/wiki/AutoZone.html" title="AutoZone">AutoZone</a> and <a href="/wiki/DaimlerChrysler.html" title="DaimlerChrysler">DaimlerChrysler</a>.</p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/September_30.html" title="September 30">September 30</a>, <a href="/wiki/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a>, Judge Kimball granted the SCO Group's request for a delay until <a href="/wiki/February_4.html" title="February 4">February 4</a>, <a href="/wiki/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>, “to file any amended pleadings or add parties to this action”. The schedule was amended again on <a href="/wiki/July_1.html" title="July 1">July 1</a>, <a href="/wiki/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>. The <a href="/wiki/Jury_trial.html" title="Jury trial">trial</a> is currently scheduled to begin in February <a href="/wiki/2007.html" title="2007">2007</a>.</p>
<p>In an “Order Granting in Part IBM's Motion to Limit SCO's Claims” dated June 28, 2006, Federal magistrate judge Brooke Wells, presiding over discovery aspects of the case, barred SCO from asserting 187 of the 198 claims that IBM had moved to exclude from the lawsuit for lack of specificity<a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20060628203537917">[1]</a>, stating “many of SCO’s arguments and much of <a href="/wiki/Marc_J._Rochkind.html" title="Marc J. Rochkind">Mr. Rochkind’s</a> declaration miss the mark”, and comparing SCO's tactics with those of an officer who accuses a citizen of theft, but will not disclose what the citizen is accused of stealing. “Certainly if an individual was stopped and accused of shoplifting after walking out of <a href="/wiki/Neiman_Marcus.html" title="Neiman Marcus">Neiman Marcus</a>, they would expect to be eventually told what they allegedly stole. It would be absurd for an officer to tell the accused that ‘you know what you stole I'm not telling.’ Or, to simply hand the accused individual a catalog of Neiman Marcus' entire inventory and say ‘it's in there somewhere, you figure it out.’” <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20060628175203644">[2]</a><a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20060628203537917">[3]</a></p>
<p>This leaves a total of about 100 claims, none of which have been judged on their merits, at issue out of the 294 originally put forth by SCO. Judge Kimball ruled earlier that dispositive motions may not be submitted until after the end of discovery, so neither side has been permitted to ask for summary judgement. However, it is worth noting that IBM (in their motion challenging the 198 claims) pointed to a claim that was sufficiently specific and could be shown to be an original disclosure by Intel, not IBM. Since the recent ruling, SCO's stock price has declined to around $2.2–$2.5 per share (early-<a href="/wiki/August_2006.html" title="August 2006">August 2006</a>).</p>

<p><a name="SCO.27s_claims" id="SCO.27s_claims"></a></p>
<h2>SCO's claims</h2>
<p>SCO's lawsuit has been consistent only in its claim of <a href="/wiki/Breach_of_contract.html" title="Breach of contract">breach of contract</a> (since the abandonment in early 2004 of its claim of misappropriation of <a href="/wiki/Trade_secret.html" title="Trade secret">trade secrets</a>). SCO's initial claims were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Misappropriation of trade secrets</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Unfair_competition.html" title="Unfair competition">Unfair competition</a></li>
<li>Interference with contract</li>
<li>Breach of IBM Software Agreement</li>
</ul>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/July_22.html" title="July 22">July 22</a>, <a href="/wiki/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a>, SCO amended its complaint. It added two new claims:</p>
<ul>
<li>Breach of IBM Sublicensing Agreement</li>
<li>Breach of Sequent Software Agreement</li>
</ul>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/February_27.html" title="February 27">February 27</a>, <a href="/wiki/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a> SCO amended the complaint again. It dropped the trade secrets claim, but added the following claims:</p>
<ul>
<li>Breach of Sequent Sublicensing Agreement</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Copyright_infringement.html" title="Copyright infringement">Copyright infringement</a></li>
<li>Interference with contract</li>
<li>Interference with business relationships</li>
</ul>
<p>SCO's claims in press releases and interviews have changed repeatedly as the affair has progressed. SCO has also both claimed and denied that the alleged copyright violations involved the <a href="/wiki/Linux_kernel.html" title="Linux kernel">Linux kernel</a>. <i>Computerworld</i> reported Chris Sontag of SCO as saying:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"It's very extensive. It is many different sections of code ranging from five to 10 to 15 lines of code in multiple places that are of issue, up to large blocks of code that have been inappropriately copied into Linux in violation of our source-code licensing contract. That's in the kernel itself, so it is significant. It is not a line or two here or there. It was quite a surprise for us."</dd>
</dl>
<p>SCO refuses to allow access to the samples of code containing the alleged copyright violations except under a <a href="/wiki/Non-disclosure_agreement.html" title="Non-disclosure agreement">non-disclosure agreement</a> (NDA). SCO's NDA would not only require that the signer keep confidential which lines of code SCO contested, but would also require that they hold confidential any information SCO told them, even if they already knew that information before being informed of it by SCO; all Linux kernel developers have considered this to be far too restrictive, so none of them has signed it. However, at SCO's annual reseller's convention in August of 2003 they revealed two short sections of code they alleged were copyright violations, and images of Darl McBride's presentation of this code were soon after published on German computer magazine publisher <a href="/wiki/Heinz_Heise.html" title="Heinz Heise">Heinz Heise</a>'s website. <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.heise.de/bilder/39519/0/1">[4]</a> <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.heise.de/bilder/39519/1/1">[5]</a></p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/May_30.html" title="May 30">May 30</a>, <a href="/wiki/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a>, SCO Group's <a href="/wiki/Chief_executive_officer.html" title="Chief executive officer">CEO</a> <a href="/wiki/Darl_McBride.html" title="Darl McBride">Darl McBride</a> was quoted as saying that the Linux kernel contained "hundreds of <a href="/wiki/Source_lines_of_code.html" title="Source lines of code">lines" of code</a> from SCO's version of UNIX, and that SCO would reveal the code to other companies under NDA in July. <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.informationweek.com/story/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=10100587">[6]</a> To put this into context, <a  class="external text" title="http://www.dwheeler.com/sloc/redhat71-v1/kernel_sloc">David Wheeler's SLOCCount</a> estimates the size of the Linux 2.4.2 kernel as 2,440,919 source lines of code out of over 30 million physical source lines of code for a typical GNU/Linux distribution. Therefore, as per SCO's own estimate, the allegedly infringing code would make up about 0.001% of the total code of a typical GNU/Linux installation. <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.dwheeler.com/sloc/">[7]</a> SCO has since upwardly revised this figure to over a million lines of code, however. <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://linuxtoday.com/infrastructure/2003082201426NWCDLL">[8]</a></p>
<p>SCO's major claims have now been reported as relating to the following components of the Linux kernel:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/wiki/Symmetric_multiprocessing.html" title="Symmetric multiprocessing">symmetric multiprocessing</a> (SMP),</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Non-uniform_memory_access.html" title="Non-uniform memory access">non-uniform memory access</a> (NUMA) multiprocessing,</li>
<li>the <a href="/wiki/Read-copy-update.html" title="Read-copy-update">read-copy-update</a> (RCU) locking strategy,
<ul>
<li>This technique is widely believed to have been developed at <a href="/wiki/Sequent_Computer_Systems.html" title="Sequent Computer Systems">Sequent Computer Systems</a>, who were then bought by IBM, who holds several patents (including <a  class="external text" title="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PALL&amp;p=1&amp;u=/netahtml/srchnum.htm&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=5,442,758.WKU.&amp;OS=PN/5,442,758&amp;RS=PN/5,442,758">5,442,758</a>) on this technique.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Silicon_Graphics.html" title="Silicon Graphics">SGI</a>'s Extended File System (<a href="/wiki/XFS.html" title="XFS">XFS</a>),</li>
<li>IBM's <a href="/wiki/JFS.html" title="JFS">JFS</a> <a href="/wiki/Journaling_file_system.html" title="Journaling file system">journaling file system</a></li>
</ul>
<p>These claims flow from the accusation of breach of contract. The contract between IBM and <a href="/wiki/AT%26T.html" title="AT&amp;T">AT&amp;T</a> (to which SCO claims to be successor in interest) allows IBM to use the <a href="/wiki/UNIX_System_V.html" title="UNIX System V">SVR4</a> code, but the SVR4 code, plus any derivative works made from that code, must be held confidential by IBM. According to IBM's interpretation of the contract, and the interpretation published by AT&amp;T in their "$ echo" newsletter in <a href="/wiki/1985.html" title="1985">1985</a>, "derivative works" means any works containing SVR4 code. But according to SCO's interpretation, "derivative works" also includes any code built on top of SVR4, even if that does not contain, or even never contained, any SVR4 code. Thus, according to SCO, any <a href="/wiki/AIX_operating_system.html" title="AIX operating system">AIX operating system</a> code that IBM developed must be kept confidential, even if it contains nothing from SVR4.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Free software/open source community reaction">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Free_software.2Fopen_source_community_reaction" id="Free_software.2Fopen_source_community_reaction"></a></p>
<h2>Free software/open source community reaction</h2>
<p>The lawsuit caused moral indignation and outrage in the <a href="/wiki/Free_software.html" title="Free software">free software</a> and <a href="/wiki/Open_source.html" title="Open source">open source</a> communities, who consider SCO's claims to be without merit, even cynically dishonest. Open source advocates' arguments include:</p>
<ul>
<li>that the Linux operating system was unlikely to contain UNIX code, as it had been written from scratch by hundreds of collaborators, with a well-documented <a href="/wiki/Provenance.html" title="Provenance">provenance</a> and revision history that was entirely in the public view;</li>
<li>that it made no technical sense to incorporate SCO UNIX code in Linux, as Linux had the technical features that are claimed to have been appropriated already implemented before SCO UNIX had them;</li>
<li>that even if Linux and SCO UNIX had some code in common, this did not necessarily mean that this code was copied to Linux from SCO UNIX -- perhaps the common pieces of code had been legitimately copied from another open source operating system, perhaps a <a href="/wiki/Berkeley_Software_Distribution.html" title="Berkeley Software Distribution">BSD</a>-derived one, or one of the historical Unix versions previously released by SCO;</li>
<li>that SCO (see <a href="/wiki/Caldera_Systems.html" title="Caldera Systems">Caldera Systems</a>) had begun as a Linux company, and has added many Linux-like features to SCO UNIX, and any common code may have in fact been copied from Linux into SCO UNIX:
<ul>
<li>and furthermore, that if such reverse copying from Linux itself had occurred, that the distribution of SCO UNIX binaries containing <a href="/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License.html" title="GNU General Public License">GPL</a>'d contributions may therefore require SCO either to remove their product from the market until GPL'd code has been removed, or to release their source code under the GPL to their users;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>that even if Linux did contain copied SCO UNIX code, the UNIX source code had already been made widely available without a <a href="/wiki/Non-disclosure_agreement.html" title="Non-disclosure agreement">non-disclosure agreement</a>, and therefore had no <a href="/wiki/Trade_secret.html" title="Trade secret">trade secret</a> status (as a judge found in <a href="/wiki/USL_v._BSDi.html" title="USL v. BSDi">USL v. BSDi</a>);</li>
<li>that even if Linux did contain some UNIX code, the SCO Group had lost any right to sue IBM for trade secret or other intellectual property infringement by distributing Linux itself (their Caldera distribution) under the <a href="/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License.html" title="GNU General Public License">GNU General Public License</a> (GPL), both before and after their announcement;</li>
<li>and finally, that even if SCO were to have a valid claim against IBM, their distribution of Linux under the GPL precludes them from pursuing any other user of Linux.</li>
</ul>
<p>SCO and its officers have been the subject of much criticism by the free software community, some of whom have stated that SCO's behavior may amount to illegal conduct. Indeed, SEC filings reveal that senior SCO executives dumped their personal holdings in SCO shortly after counter-suits were filed by IBM and Red Hat, lending credence to the idea that the lawsuit's primary purpose is manipulation of SCO's stock price. SCO Group's CEO <a href="/wiki/Darl_McBride.html" title="Darl McBride">Darl McBride</a> has been the subject of particular criticism, because of his extreme statements to the press.</p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/May_30.html" title="May 30">May 30</a>, <a href="/wiki/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a>, <a href="/wiki/Linus_Torvalds.html" title="Linus Torvalds">Linus Torvalds</a> was quoted by IDG.net as saying, regarding the case:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"Quite frankly, I found it mostly interesting in a <a href="/wiki/Jerry_Springer.html" title="Jerry Springer">Jerry Springer</a> kind of way. White trash battling it out in public, throwing chairs at each other. SCO crying about IBM's other women. ... Fairly entertaining."</dd>
</dl>
<p>In an interview on <a href="/wiki/June_23.html" title="June 23">June 23</a>, <a href="/wiki/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a>, Torvalds responded to SCO's allegation that Linux development had no process for vetting kernel contributions:</p>
<dl>

<h2>The GPL issue</h2>
<p>Within a few months of the filing of the lawsuit, Eben Moglen, the <a href="/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation.html" title="Free Software Foundation">Free Software Foundation</a>'s legal counsel, stated that SCO's suit should not concern Linux users other than IBM. In an interview with <i>internetnews.com</i>, he was reported as saying:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"There is absolute difficulty with this line of argument which ought to make everybody in the world aware that the letters that SCO has put out can be safely put in the wastebasket," ...</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>"From the moment that SCO distributed that code under the GNU General Public License, they would have given everybody in the world the right to copy, modify and distribute that code freely," ... "From the moment SCO distributed the Linux kernel under GPL, they licensed the use. Always. That's what our license says."</dd>
</dl>
<p>Apparently noticing the incongruity of their selling a Linux distribution while suing IBM for stealing their intellectual property and giving it to the developers of that operating system, the SCO Group then announced on <a href="/wiki/May_14.html" title="May 14">May 14</a>, <a href="/wiki/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a> that they would no longer distribute Linux. According to their press release, "SCO will continue to support existing SCO Linux and Caldera OpenLinux customers and hold them harmless from any SCO intellectual property issues regarding SCO Linux and Caldera OpenLinux products."</p>
<p>SCO currently claims:</p>
<ul>
<li>Any code belonging to SCO that might have been GPL'd was done by SCO employees without proper legal authorization, and thus is not legally GPL'd.</li>
<li>That for code to be GPL'd, the code's copyright owner must put a GPL notice before the code, but since SCO itself wasn't the one to add the notices, the code was never GPL'd.</li>
</ul>

<h2>The GPL and the US Constitution</h2>
<p>Section 8 of <a href="/wiki/Article_One_%28United_States_Constitution%29.html" title="Article One (United States Constitution)">Article One</a> of the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Constitution.html" title="United States Constitution">United States Constitution</a> states that</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>[<a href="/wiki/United_States_Congress.html" title="United States Congress">Congress</a> shall have power] to promote the progress of science and useful arts, by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Since the GNU General Public License for the most part disclaims exclusive rights, SCO claimed that its use violates this clause. SCO's argument asks the court to limit both Congress's discretion in implementing the copyright clause, which the Supreme court refused to do in <i><a href="/wiki/Eldred_v._Ashcroft.html" title="Eldred v. Ashcroft">Eldred v. Ashcroft</a></i>, and copyright holders' discretion over the enjoyment of their exclusive rights. The GPL specifically prohibits, in section 7, distribution of software in jurisdictions where the laws are incompatible with the GPL, so a ruling that upheld SCO's constitutional argument would prevent distribution of Linux (and other copylefted software) in the United States.</p>

"To Novell's knowledge, the <a href="/wiki/1995.html" title="1995">1995</a> agreement governing SCO's purchase of UNIX from Novell does not convey to SCO the associated copyrights," a letter to the SCO Group's CEO Darl McBride said in part. "We believe it unlikely that SCO can demonstrate that it has any ownership interest whatsoever in those copyrights. Apparently you share this view, since over the last few months you have repeatedly asked Novell to transfer the copyrights to SCO, requests that Novell has rejected."</p>
<p>SCO later claimed to have discovered an amendment to their contract with Novell transferring partial ownership to SCO. Novell stated that the amendment "appears to bear a valid Novell signature, and the language, though convoluted, seems to support SCO's claim that ownership of some copyrights for Unix did transfer to SCO"; Novell also said that it could not find its own copy of the amendment.</p>
<p>But in subsequent letters to SCO that Novell released as part of a press release on <a href="/wiki/December_22.html" title="December 22">December 22</a>, <a href="/wiki/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a>, <a  class="new" title="Joseph LaSala Jr.">Joseph LaSala Jr.</a>, Novell's general counsel, argued that the amendment provided for a copyright transfer only under certain conditions that SCO has allegedly failed to meet.</p>
<p>SCO was quick to dismiss Novell's claims. The same day, during a conference call to discuss SCO's quarterly financial results, SCO CEO Darl McBride said "We see this as a fraudulent filing of copyright notices ... and we'll take the appropriate measures as necessary with our legal team." SCO made good on this threat on <a href="/wiki/January_20.html" title="January 20">January 20</a>, <a href="/wiki/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>, when it filed <a href="/wiki/SCO_v._Novell.html" title="SCO v.

<h2>IBM counterclaims against SCO</h2>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/August_6.html" title="August 6">August 6</a>, <a href="/wiki/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a>, IBM filed its counterclaims against SCO. <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://lwn.net/Articles/43592/">[11]</a> <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://twiki.iwethey.org/twiki/pub/Main/SCOvsIBMTimeline/IBMSCOCountersuit.txt">[12]</a> It made 10 counterclaims:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/wiki/Breach_of_contract.html" title="Breach of contract">breach of contract</a></li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Lanham_Act.html" title="Lanham Act">Lanham Act</a> violation</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Unfair_competition.html" title="Unfair competition">Unfair competition</a></li>

<li>Breach of the <a href="/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License.html" title="GNU General Public License">GNU General Public License</a></li>
<li>and four counts of <a href="/wiki/Patent_infringement.html" title="Patent infringement">patent infringement</a></li>
</ul>
<p>In response to these counterclaims, SCO has asserted that the GPL is unenforceable, void, and violates the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Constitution.html" title="United States Constitution">United States Constitution</a>. If these claims are true, then the GPL'd applications that SCO continues to distribute (like <a href="/wiki/Samba_software.html" title="Samba software">Samba</a>) are being distributed without the permission of the copyright owners of those applications (since the permission was the GPL itself), which would be illegal. Thus some speculate that, in order to remain legally consistent, SCO will claim that software that has been GPL'd is actually in the <a href="/wiki/Public_domain.html" title="Public domain">public domain</a>.</p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/September_25.html" title="September 25">September 25</a>, <a href="/wiki/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a> IBM amended its counterclaims bringing the total number of counterclaims to 13. The new counterclaims are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/wiki/Copyright_infringement.html" title="Copyright infringement">Copyright infringement</a>
<ul>
<li>This counterclaim involves an alleged copyright infringement by SCO of GPL-licensed IBM code in the Linux kernel. Some commentators have pointed out that if SCO manages to invalidate the GPL, they are highly likely to be caught by this counterclaim, as it is of the same form as their claim against IBM.<a  class="external autonumber" title="http://twiki.iwethey.org/twiki/pub/Main/SCOvsIBMReferences/ibmamendedcounterclaims.pdf">[13]</a></li>

It dropped one of the patent infringement claims, but added 2 new Declaratory judgments of Noninfringement of Copyrights. One of these seeks a declaration that IBM's AIX-related activities do not infringe any of SCO's copyrights. The other one seeks a similar declaration about IBM's Linux-related activities.</p>

<h2>Discovery</h2>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Discovery_%28law%29.html" title="Discovery (law)">discovery</a> portion of the lawsuit has been dragging on for an unusual amount of time. The basis for SCO's suit is that any code developed on top of SVR5 is a derivative work of SVR5 (which would include AIX), and that IBM has publicly admitted to contributing AIX code to the Linux kernel. Since SCO has never seen the AIX code, it has, as part of the discovery process, <a href="/wiki/Deposition_%28law%29.html" title="Deposition (law)">deposed</a> IBM for the AIX code, so that it can compare AIX code to Linux kernel code. IBM, rejecting SCO's concept of derivative work, has deposed SCO for which lines of code it claims are infringing. SCO has responded that it can't determine which code is infringing until it has had the chance to look at the AIX code.</p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/December_5.html" title="December 5">December 5</a>, <a href="/wiki/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a>, in the first oral arguments relating to the discovery process, a judge granted IBM's two motions to compel against SCO, and deferred consideration of SCO's motions until later. This gave SCO a 30 day deadline to provide "with specificity" which lines of code in Linux they claim form the basis of their case. This was widely regarded as a first-round victory for IBM. <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=2003121122033016">[14]</a> <a  class="external text" title="http://www.groklaw.net/pdf/Doc-88-transcript.pdf">PDF</a></p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/June_28.html" title="June 28">June 28</a>, <a href="/wiki/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> Judge Brooke Wells granted IBM's motion to dismiss most of SCO's case, citing in part SCO's inability to provide any evidence to back up their claims:</p>
