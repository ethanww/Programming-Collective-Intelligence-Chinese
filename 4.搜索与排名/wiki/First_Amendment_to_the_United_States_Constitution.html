<h2>Background</h2>
<p>The original text of the Constitution generated some opposition on the ground that it did not include adequate guarantees of civil liberties. In response, the First Amendment, along with the rest of the Bill of Rights, was adopted. The process of adoption by <a href="/wiki/Ratification.html" title="Ratification">ratifications</a> by the requisite number of states was completed in <a href="/wiki/December_15.html" title="December 15">December 15</a>, <a href="/wiki/1791.html" title="1791">1791</a>.</p>
<p>The text of the amendment reads as follows:</p>

<p>The Establishment Clause of the First Amendment prohibits the establishment of a national religion by Congress or the preference of one religion over another, or religion over nonreligion. Prior to the enactment of the <a href="/wiki/Fourteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution.html" title="Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution">Fourteenth Amendment</a>, and for 57 years thereafter, the courts took the position that the substantive protections of the Bill of Rights did not apply to actions by state governments. Subsequently, under the "<a href="/wiki/Incorporation_doctrine.html" title="Incorporation doctrine">incorporation doctrine</a>," certain selected provisions were applied to states. It was not, however, until the middle and later years of the twentieth century that the <a href="/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States.html" title="Supreme Court of the United States">Supreme Court</a> began to interpret the establishment and free exercise clauses in such a manner as to restrict substantially the promotion of religion by state governments. (For example, in the <i><a href="/wiki/Board_of_Education_of_Kiryas_Joel_Village_School_District_v._Grumet.html" title="Board of Education of Kiryas Joel Village School District v. Grumet">Board of Education of Kiryas Joel Village School District v.

<p>The <a href="/wiki/Warren_Court.html" title="Warren Court">Warren Court</a> held that this meant governments must have a compelling interest before passing a law that unduly burdens the practice of religion. Later court decisions retreated from this standard, permitting governmental actions that were neutral to interfere with religion, but Congress attempted to restore it by passing the <a href="/wiki/Religious_Freedom_Restoration_Act.html" title="Religious Freedom Restoration Act">Religious Freedom Restoration Act</a>, which the Supreme Court held was inapplicable to state and local government actions, albeit applicable to federal action. <i><a href="/wiki/City_of_Boerne_v._Flores.html" title="City of Boerne v.

<p><a name="Sedition" id="Sedition"></a></p>
<h3>Sedition</h3>
<p>Remarkably, the <a href="/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States.html" title="Supreme Court of the United States">Supreme Court</a> did not consider a single case in which it was asked to <a href="/wiki/Judicial_review.html" title="Judicial review">strike down</a> a federal law on the basis of the free speech clause until the twentieth century. The <a href="/wiki/Alien_and_Sedition_Acts.html" title="Alien and Sedition Acts">Alien and Sedition Acts</a> of 1798 were never ruled upon by the Supreme Court, and even the leading critics of the law, <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson.html" title="Thomas Jefferson">Thomas Jefferson</a> and <a href="/wiki/James_Madison.html" title="James Madison">James Madison</a>, argued for the laws' unconstitutionality on the basis of the Tenth Amendment, not the First Amendment.</p>
<p>After <a href="/wiki/World_War_I.html" title="World War I">World War I</a>, several cases involving laws limiting speech came before the Supreme Court. The <a href="/wiki/Espionage_Act_of_1917.html" title="Espionage Act of 1917">Espionage Act of 1917</a> imposed a maximum sentence of twenty years for anyone who caused or attempted to cause "insubordination, disloyalty, mutiny, or refusal of duty in the military or naval forces of the United States." Under the Act, over two thousand prosecutions were commenced. For instance, one filmmaker was sentenced to ten years imprisonment because his portrayal of British soldiers in a movie about the <a href="/wiki/American_Revolution.html" title="American Revolution">American Revolution</a> impugned the good faith of an American ally, the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom.html" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>. The <a href="/wiki/Sedition_Act_of_1918.html" title="Sedition Act of 1918">Sedition Act of 1918</a> went even farther, criminalizing "disloyal," "scurrilous" or "abusive" language against the government.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court was first requested to strike down a law violating the free speech clause in 1919. The case involved Charles Schenck, who had during the war published leaflets challenging the conscription system then in effect. The Supreme Court unanimously upheld Schenck's conviction for violating the Espionage Act when it decided <i><a href="/wiki/Schenck_v._United_States.html" title="Schenck v. United States">Schenck v. United States</a></i>, <a href="/wiki/Court_citation.html" title="Court citation">249 U.S. 47</a> (1919). Justice <a href="/wiki/Oliver_Wendell_Holmes%2C_Jr..html" title="Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.">Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.</a>, writing for the Court, suggested that "the question in every case is whether the words used are in such circumstances and are of such a nature as to create a <a href="/wiki/Clear_and_present_danger.html" title="Clear and present danger">clear and present danger</a> that they will bring about the substantive evils that Congress has a right to prevent."</p>
<p>The "clear and present danger" test of <i>Schenck</i> was extended in <i><a href="/wiki/Debs_v._United_States.html" title="Debs v. United States">Debs v. United States</a></i>, <a href="/wiki/Court_citation.html" title="Court citation">249 U.S. 211</a> (1919), again by Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes. The case involved a speech made by <a href="/wiki/Eugene_V._Debs.html" title="Eugene V. Debs">Eugene V. Debs</a>, a political activist. Debs had not spoken any words that posed a "clear and present danger" to the <a href="/wiki/Conscription.html" title="Conscription">conscription</a> system, but a speech in which he denounced <a href="/wiki/Militarism.html" title="Militarism">militarism</a> was nonetheless found to be sufficient grounds for his conviction. Justice Holmes suggested that the speech had a "natural tendency" to occlude the draft.</p>
<p>Thus, the Supreme Court effectively shaped the First Amendment in such a manner as to permit a multitude of restrictions on speech. Further restrictions on speech were accepted by the Supreme Court when it decided <i><a href="/wiki/Gitlow_v._New_York.html" title="Gitlow v. New York">Gitlow v. New York</a></i>, <a href="/wiki/Court_citation.html" title="Court citation">268 U.S. 652</a> (1925). Writing for the majority, Justice <a href="/wiki/Edward_Sanford.html" title="Edward Sanford">Edward Sanford</a> suggested that states could punish words that "by their very nature, involve danger to the public peace and to the security of the state." Lawmakers were given the freedom to decide which speech would constitute a danger.</p>
<p>Freedom of speech was influenced by anti-Communism during the <a href="/wiki/Cold_War.html" title="Cold War">Cold War</a>. In 1940, Congress enacted the Smith Act to replace the Sedition Act of 1918, which had expired in 1921. The Smith Act made punishable the advocacy of "the propriety of overthrowing or destroying any government in the United States by force and violence." The law was mainly used as a weapon against <a href="/wiki/Communist.html" title="Communist">Communist</a> leaders. The constitutionality of the Act was questioned in the case <i><a href="/wiki/Dennis_v._United_States.html" title="Dennis v. United States">Dennis v. United States</a></i> <a href="/wiki/Court_citation.html" title="Court citation">341 U.S. 494</a> (1951). The Court upheld the law in 1951 by a six-two vote (Justice <a href="/wiki/Tom_C._Clark.html" title="Tom C. Clark">Tom C. Clark</a> did not participate because he had previously ordered the prosecutions when he was <a href="/wiki/Attorney_General.html" title="Attorney General">Attorney General</a>). Chief Justice <a href="/wiki/Fred_M._Vinson.html" title="Fred M. Vinson">Fred M. Vinson</a> relied on Oliver Wendell Holmes' "clear and present danger" test when he wrote for the majority. Vinson suggested that the doctrine did not require the government to "wait until the putsch is about to be executed, the plans have been laid and the signal is awaited", thereby broadly defining the words "clear and present danger". Thus, even though there was no immediate danger posed by the Communist Party's ideas, their speech was restricted by the Court.</p>
<p><i>Dennis</i> has never been explicitly overruled by the Court, but future decisions have in practice reversed the case. In 1957, the Court changed its interpretation of the Smith Act in deciding <i><a href="/wiki/Yates_v._United_States.html" title="Yates v. United States">Yates v. United States</a></i>, <a href="/wiki/Court_citation.html" title="Court citation">354 U.S. 298</a> (1957). The Supreme Court ruled that the Act was aimed at "the advocacy of action, not ideas". Thus, the advocacy of abstract doctrine remains protected under the First Amendment. Only speech explicitly inciting the forcible overthrow of the government remains punishable under the Smith Act.</p>

<p><a name="War_protests" id="War_protests"></a></p>
<h3>War protests</h3>
<p>The Supreme Court under Chief Justice Earl Warren expanded free speech protections in the 1960s, though there were exceptions. However, in 1968, the Court upheld a law prohibiting the mutilation of <a href="/wiki/Draft_card.html" title="Draft card">draft cards</a> in <i><a href="/wiki/United_States_v._O%27Brien.html" title="United States v. O'Brien">United States v. O'Brien</a></i> <a href="/wiki/Court_citation.html" title="Court citation">391 U.S. 367</a> (1968). The Court ruled that protesters could not burn draft cards because doing so would interfere with the "smooth and efficient functioning" of the draft system. Then again, in 1971, the court found that a person could not be punished for wearing in the corridors of the Los Angeles county Courthouse a jacket reading "Fuck the Draft," <i><a href="/wiki/Cohen_v._California.html" title="Cohen v. California">Cohen v. California</a></i> (<a href="/wiki/Court_citation.html" title="Court citation">403 U.S. 15</a>).</p>
<p>In 1969, the Supreme Court ruled that free speech rights extended to students in school while deciding <i><a href="/wiki/Tinker_v._Des_Moines_Independent_Community_School_District.html" title="Tinker v.

<h3>Flag burning</h3>
<p>The divisive issue of <a href="/wiki/Flag_burning.html" title="Flag burning">flag burning</a> as a form of protest came before the Supreme Court in 1989, as it decided <i><a href="/wiki/Texas_v._Johnson.html" title="Texas v.

Many in Congress vilified the decision of the Court. The House unanimously passed a resolution denouncing the Court; the Senate did the same with only three dissents <sup title="The text in the vicinity of this tag needs citation." class="noprint">[<a  title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><i>citation&#160;needed</i></a>]</sup>. Congress passed a federal law barring flag burning, but the Supreme Court struck it down as well in <i><a href="/wiki/United_States_v._Eichman.html" title="United States v. Eichman">United States v.

<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Obscenity">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Obscenity" id="Obscenity"></a></p>
<h3>Obscenity</h3>
<p>The federal government and the states have long been permitted to restrict obscene or <a href="/wiki/Pornographic.html" title="Pornographic">pornographic</a> speech. While obscene speech generally has no protection under the First Amendment, pornography is subject to little regulation. The exact definition of <a href="/wiki/Obscenity.html" title="Obscenity">obscenity</a> and <a href="/wiki/Pornography.html" title="Pornography">pornography</a>, however, has changed over time.</p>
<p>When it decided <i>Rosen v. United States</i> in 1896, the Supreme Court adopted the same obscenity standard as had been articulated in a famous British case, <i>Regina v. Hicklin</i>. The Hicklin standard defined material as obscene if it tended "to deprave or corrupt those whose minds are open to such immoral influences, and into whose hands a publication of this sort may fall". Thus, the standards of the most sensitive members of the community were the standards for obscenity. In 1957, the Court ruled in <i><a href="/wiki/Roth_v._United_States.html" title="Roth v. United States">Roth v. United States</a></i> that the Hicklin test was inappropriate. Instead, the Roth test for obscenity was "whether to the average person, applying contemporary community standards, the dominant theme of the material, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest."</p>
<p>In 1964 Justice <a href="/wiki/Potter_Stewart.html" title="Potter Stewart">Potter Stewart</a> famously stated that although he could not precisely define pornography, "I know it when I see it."</p>
<p>The Roth test was expanded when the Court decided <i><a href="/wiki/Miller_v._California.html" title="Miller v. California">Miller v. California</a></i> in 1973. Under the <a href="/wiki/Miller_test.html" title="Miller test">Miller test</a>, a work is obscene if it would be found appealing to the prurient interest by an average person applying contemporary community standards, depicts <a  class="new" title="Sexual conduct">sexual conduct</a> in a patently offensive way and has no serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value. Note that "community" standards—not national standards—are applied as to whether the material appeals to the prurient interest; thus, material may be deemed obscene in one locality but not in another. National standards, however, are applied as to whether the material is of value. <a href="/wiki/Child_pornography.html" title="Child pornography">Child pornography</a> is not subject to the Miller test, as the Supreme Court decided in 1982. The Court felt that the government's interest in protecting children from abuse was paramount.</p>
<p>Yet, personal possession of obscene material in the home may not be prohibited by law. In writing for the Court in the case of <i><a href="/wiki/Stanley_v._Georgia.html" title="Stanley v. Georgia">Stanley v. Georgia</a>,</i> Justice <a href="/wiki/Thurgood_Marshall.html" title="Thurgood Marshall">Thurgood Marshall</a> wrote, "if the First Amendment means anything, it means that a State has no business telling a man sitting in his own house what books he may read or what films he may watch." It is not, however, unconstitutional for the government to prevent the mailing or sale of obscene items, though they may be viewed only in private. <i><a href="/wiki/Ashcroft_v._Free_Speech_Coalition.html" title="Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition">Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition</a></i> (2002) further upholds these rights by invalidating the 1996 Child Pornography Prevention Act, holding that "banning the depiction of pornographic images of children, including computer-generated images, was overly broad and unconstitutional under the First Amendment". Justice Anthony M. Kennedy wrote: "First Amendment freedoms are most in danger when the government seeks to control thought or to justify its laws for that impermissible end. The right to think is the beginning of freedom, and speech must be protected from the government because speech is the beginning of thought."</p>
<p>U.S. courts have upheld certain regulation of pornographic speech. U.S. courts have found that regulation and banning pornography as a way of protecting children meets the <a href="/wiki/Strict_scrutiny.html" title="Strict scrutiny">strict scrutiny</a> test. A zoning regulation which restricts where pornography can be viewed is valid if the purpose for the statute is based on secondary effects, the zoning is not related to the suppression of the pornographic content and the statute makes other ways of viewing the content.</p>

<p><a name="Libel.2C_slander.2C_and_private_action" id="Libel.2C_slander.2C_and_private_action"></a></p>
<h3>Libel, slander, and private action</h3>
<p>The American prohibition on defamatory speech or publications—<a href="/wiki/Slander_and_libel.html" title="Slander and libel">slander and libel</a>—traces its origins to English law. The nature of defamation law was vitally changed by the Supreme Court in 1964, while deciding <i><a href="/wiki/New_York_Times_Co._v._Sullivan.html" title="New York Times Co. v. Sullivan">New York Times Co. v. Sullivan</a></i>. <i><a href="/wiki/The_New_York_Times.html" title="The New York Times">The New York Times</a></i> had published an advertisement indicating that officials in <a href="/wiki/Montgomery%2C_Alabama.html" title="Montgomery, Alabama">Montgomery</a>, <a href="/wiki/Alabama.html" title="Alabama">Alabama</a> had acted violently in suppressing the protests of African-Americans during the Civil Rights Movement. The <a  class="new" title="Montgomery Police">Montgomery Police</a> Commissioner, <a  class="new" title="L. B. Sullivan">L. B. Sullivan</a>, sued the <i>Times</i> for libel on the grounds that the advertisement damaged his reputation. The Supreme Court unanimously overruled the $500,000 judgment against the <i>Times</i>. Justice <a href="/wiki/William_J._Brennan.html" title="William J. Brennan">William J. Brennan</a> suggested that public officials may sue for libel only if the publisher published the statements in question with "<a href="/wiki/Actual_malice.html" title="Actual malice">actual malice</a>", a difficult standard to meet.</p>
<p>The actual malice standard applies to both public officials and public figures, including celebrities. Though the details vary from state to state, private individuals normally need only to prove negligence on the part of the defendant.</p>
<p>In <i><a  class="new" title="Greenbelt Cooperative Publishing Association, Inc. v. Bresler">Greenbelt Cooperative Publishing Association, Inc. v. Bresler</a></i>, <a href="/wiki/Court_citation.html" title="Court citation">398 U.S. 6</a> (1970) the supreme court ruled that an article which quoted a visitor to a city council meeting who didn't like Bresler's aggressive stance in negotiating with the city as "blackmail" to not be libelous since nobody could believe anyone was claiming that Bresler had committed a crime and that the statement was essentially hyperbole, i.e. obviously an opinion.</p>
<p>As the Supreme Court again ruled in <i><a href="/wiki/Gertz_v._Robert_Welch%2C_Inc..html" title="Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc.">Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc.</a></i> (1974), opinions cannot be considered defamatory. It is thus permissible to suggest, for instance, that a lawyer is a bad one, but not permissible to declare that the lawyer is ignorant of the law: the former constitutes a statement of values, but the latter is a statement alleging a fact.</p>
<p>More recently, in <i><a href="/wiki/Milkovich_v._Lorain_Journal_Co..html" title="Milkovich v. Lorain Journal Co.">Milkovich v. Lorain Journal Co.</a></i> 497 U.S. 1 (1990), the Supreme Court backed off from the protection from "opinion" announced in <i>Gertz</i>. The court in <i>Milkovich</i> specifically held that there is no wholesale exemption to defamation law for statements labeled "opinion," but instead that a statement must be provably false (falsifiable) before it can be the subject of a libel suit.</p>
<p>In 1988, <i><a href="/wiki/Hustler_Magazine_v._Falwell.html" title="Hustler Magazine v. Falwell">Hustler Magazine v. Falwell</a></i> extended the "actual malice" standard to intentional infliction of emotional distress in a ruling which protected a <a href="/wiki/Parody.html" title="Parody">parodic</a> caricature. In the ruling, "actual malice" was described as "knowledge that the statement was false or with reckless disregard as to whether or not it was true."</p>
<p>Ordinarily, the First Amendment only applies to prohibit direct government censorship. The protection from libel suits recognizes that the power of the state is needed to enforce a libel judgment between private persons. The Supreme Court's scrutiny of defamation suits is thus sometimes considered part of a broader trend in U.S. jurisprudence away from the strict state action requirement, and into the application of First Amendment principles when private actors invoke state power.</p>
<p>Likewise, the <a href="/wiki/Noerr-Pennington_doctrine.html" title="Noerr-Pennington doctrine">Noerr-Pennington doctrine</a> is a rule of law that often prohibits the application of antitrust law to statements made by competitors before public bodies: a monopolist may freely go before the city council and urge the denial of its competitor's building permit without being subject to <a href="/wiki/Sherman_Act.html" title="Sherman Act">Sherman Act</a> liability. This principle is being applied to litigation outside the antitrust context, including state tort suits for intentional interference with business relations and "<a href="/wiki/SLAPP.html" title="SLAPP">SLAPP</a> Suits".</p>
<p>Similarly, some states have adopted, under their protections for free speech, the <a href="/wiki/Pruneyard_Shopping_Center%2C_Campbell%2C_California.html" title="Pruneyard Shopping Center, Campbell, California">Pruneyard</a> doctrine, which prohibits private property owners whose property is equivalent to a traditional public forum (often shopping malls and grocery stores) from enforcing their private property rights to exclude political speakers and petition-gatherers. This doctrine has been rejected as a matter of federal constitutional law, but is meeting growing acceptance as a matter of state law.</p>

<h3>Political speech</h3>
<p>The Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 and related laws restricted the monetary contributions that may be made to political campaigns and expenditure by candidates. The Supreme Court considered the constitutionality of the Act in <i><a href="/wiki/Buckley_v._Valeo.html" title="Buckley v. Valeo">Buckley v. Valeo</a></i>, decided in 1976. The Court affirmed some parts of the Act and rejected others. The Court concluded that limits on campaign contributions "serve[d] the basic governmental interest in safeguarding the integrity of the electoral process without directly impinging upon the rights of individual citizens and candidates to engage in political debate and discussion." At the same time, the Court overturned the expenditure limits, which it found imposed "substantial restraints on the quantity of political speech."</p>
<p>Further rules on campaign finance were scrutinized by the Court when it determined <i><a href="/wiki/McConnell_v._FEC.html" title="McConnell v. FEC">McConnell v. Federal Election Commission</a></i> in 2003. The case centered on the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002, a law that introduced several new restrictions on campaign financing. The Supreme Court upheld provisions which barred the raising of <a href="/wiki/Soft_money.html" title="Soft money">soft money</a> by national parties and the use of soft money by private organizations to finance certain election-related advertisements. At the same time, the Court struck down the "choice of expenditure" rule, which required that parties could either make coordinated expenditures for all its candidates, or permit candidates to spend independently, but not both, further stating that a "provision place[d] an unconstitutional burden on the parties' right to make unlimited independent expenditures." The Supreme Court also ruled that the provision preventing minors from making political contributions was unconstitutional, relying on the precedent on the <i>Tinker</i> case.

<p>Freedom of the press, like freedom of speech, is subject to restrictions on bases such as defamation law. Restrictions, however, have been struck down if they are aimed at the political message or content of newspapers.</p>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/Branzburg_v._Hayes.html" title="Branzburg v. Hayes">Branzburg v.

The 5-4 decision was that such a protection was not provided by the First Amendment.</p>

<h3>Taxation of the press</h3>
<p>State governments retain the right to tax newspapers, just as they may tax other commercial products. Generally, however, taxes that focus exclusively on newspapers have been found unconstitutional. In <i><a href="/wiki/Grosjean_v._American_Press_Co..html" title="Grosjean v. American Press Co.">Grosjean v. American Press Co.</a></i> (1936), the Court invalidated a state tax on newspaper advertising revenues. Similarly, some taxes that give preferential treatment to the press have been struck down. In 1987, for instance, the Court invalidated an <a href="/wiki/Arkansas.html" title="Arkansas">Arkansas</a> law exempting "religious, professional, trade and sports journals" from taxation since the law amounted to the regulation of newspaper content.</p>
<p>In <i>Leathers v. Medlock</i> (1991), the Supreme Court found that states may treat different types of the media differently, such as by taxing cable television, but not newspapers. The Court found that "differential taxation of speakers, even members of the press, does not implicate the First Amendment unless the tax is directed at, or presents the danger of suppressing, particular ideas."</p>

<p><a name="Content_regulation" id="Content_regulation"></a></p>
<h3>Content regulation</h3>
<p>The courts have rarely treated content-based regulation of the press with any sympathy. In <i><a  class="new" title="Miami Herald Pub. Co. v. Tornillo">Miami Herald Pub. Co. v. Tornillo</a></i> (1971), the Court unanimously struck down a state law requiring newspapers criticizing political candidates to publish their responses. The state claimed that the law had been passed to ensure press responsibility. Finding that only freedom, and not press responsibility, is mandated by the First Amendment, the Supreme Court ruled that the government may not force newspapers to publish that which they do not desire to publish.</p>
<p>Content-based regulation of television and radio, however, have been sustained by the Supreme Court in various cases. Since there are a limited number of frequencies for non-cable television and radio stations, the government licenses them to various companies. The Supreme Court, however, has ruled that the problem of scarcity does not permit the raising of a First Amendment issue. The government may restrain broadcasters, but only on a content-neutral basis.</p>

</dd>

<p>The right to petition the government has been interpreted as extending to petitions of all three branches: the Congress, the executive and the judiciary. The Supreme Court has interpreted "redress of grievances" broadly; thus, it is possible for one to request the government to exercise its powers in furtherance of the general public good. However, a few times Congress has directly limited the right to petition. During the 1790s, Congress passed the Alien and Sedition Acts, punishing opponents of the <a href="/wiki/Federalist_Party.html" title="Federalist Party">Federalist Party</a>; the Supreme Court never ruled on the matter. In 1835 the House of Representatives adopted the "<a href="/wiki/Gag_Rule.html" title="Gag Rule">Gag Rule</a>," barring abolitionist petitions calling for the end of slavery. The Supreme Court did not hear a case related to the rule, which was in any event abolished in 1844. During World War I, individuals petitioning for the repeal of sedition and espionage laws (<i>see above</i>) were punished; again, the Supreme Court did not rule on the matter.</p>
<p>The right of assembly was originally closely tied to the right to petition. One significant case involving the two rights was <i><a href="/wiki/United_States_v._Cruikshank.html" title="United States v. Cruikshank">United States v. Cruikshank</a></i> (1876). There, the Supreme Court held that citizens may "assemble for the purpose of petitioning Congress for a redress of grievances." Essentially, it was held that the right to assemble was secondary, while the right to petition was primary. Later cases, however, have expanded the meaning of the right to assembly. <i><a href="/wiki/Hague_v._CIO.html" title="Hague v. CIO">Hague v. CIO</a></i> (1939), for instance, refers to the right to assemble for the "communication of views on national questions" and for "disseminating information."</p>

<h2>International significance</h2>
<p>Most provisions of the United States Bill of Rights are based on the <a href="/wiki/English_Bill_of_Rights.html" title="English Bill of Rights">English Bill of Rights</a> (1689) and on other aspects of <a href="/wiki/English_law.html" title="English law">English law</a>. The English Bill of Rights, however, does not include many of the protections found in the First Amendment. For example, while the First Amendment guarantees freedom of speech to the general populace, the English Bill of Rights only protected "freedom of speech and debates or proceedings in Parliament." The <a href="/wiki/Declaration_of_the_Rights_of_Man_and_of_the_Citizen.html" title="Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen">Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen</a>, a French revolutionary document passed only weeks before Congress proposed the Bill of Rights, contains certain guarantees that are similar to the First Amendment's. For instance, it suggests that "every citizen may, accordingly, speak, write, and print with freedom."</p>
<p>Freedom of speech in the United States is more extensive than nearly any other nation in the world. While the First Amendment does not explicitly set restrictions on freedom of speech, other declarations of rights sometimes do so. The <a href="/wiki/European_Convention_on_Human_Rights.html" title="European Convention on Human Rights">European Convention on Human Rights</a>, for example, permits restrictions "in the interests of national security, territorial integrity or public safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, for the protection of the reputation or the rights of others, for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence, or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary," and in practice these loopholes have been interpreted quite broadly by the courts of Europe.</p>
<p>The First Amendment was one of the first guarantees of religious freedom: neither the English Bill of Rights, nor the French Declaration of Rights, contains an equivalent guarantee.</p>
