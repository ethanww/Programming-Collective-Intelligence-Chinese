</div>
</div>
<p><i><b>Porgy and Bess</b></i> is an <a href="/wiki/Opera.html" title="Opera">opera</a> with music by <a href="/wiki/George_Gershwin.html" title="George Gershwin">George Gershwin</a>, <a href="/wiki/Libretto.html" title="Libretto">libretto</a> by <a href="/wiki/DuBose_Heyward.html" title="DuBose Heyward">DuBose Heyward</a>, and lyrics by <a href="/wiki/Ira_Gershwin.html" title="Ira Gershwin">Ira Gershwin</a> and Heyward. It was based on Heyward's novel <i><a href="/wiki/Porgy.html" title="Porgy">Porgy</a></i> and the play of the same name that he co-wrote with his wife <a href="/wiki/Dorothy_Heyward.html" title="Dorothy Heyward">Dorothy</a>. All three works deal with <a href="/wiki/African_American.html" title="African American">African American</a> life in the fictitious <i>Catfish Row</i> in <a href="/wiki/Charleston%2C_South_Carolina.html" title="Charleston, South Carolina">Charleston, South Carolina</a> in the early <a href="/wiki/1930s.html" title="1930s">1930s</a>.</p>
<p>Originally conceived by Gershwin as an "American folk opera," the work was first performed in the fall of <a href="/wiki/1935.html" title="1935">1935</a>, but was not widely accepted in the <a href="/wiki/United_States.html" title="United States">United States</a> as a legitimate opera until the late <a href="/wiki/1970s.html" title="1970s">1970s</a> and <a href="/wiki/1980s.html" title="1980s">'80s</a>: it is now considered part of the standard operatic repertoire. <i>Porgy and Bess</i> is also regularly performed internationally, and several recordings of the complete work, including Gershwin's cuts, have been made. Despite this acclaim, the opera has been controversial; some from the outset have considered it <a href="/wiki/Racist.html" title="Racist">racist</a>.</p>
<p>"<a href="/wiki/Summertime_%28song%29.html" title="Summertime (song)">Summertime</a>" is by far the best-known piece from the work, and countless interpretations of this and other individual numbers have also been recorded and performed. The opera is admired for Gershwin's innovative synthesis of European orchestral techniques with American <a href="/wiki/Jazz.html" title="Jazz">jazz</a> and <a href="/wiki/Folk_music.html" title="Folk music">folk music</a> idioms. <i>Porgy and Bess</i> tells the story of Porgy, a crippled black man living in the slums of Charleston, South Carolina, and his attempts to rescue Bess from the clutches of Crown, her pimp, and Sportin' Life, the drug dealer.</p>

<p><b>Setting:</b> Catfish Row, a fictitious suburb of Charleston, South Carolina in the 'recent past' (c.1930).</p>

<h3>Act I</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Scene 1 - Catfish Row, a summer evening.</b></li>
</ul>
<p>The opera begins with a short introduction which segues into an evening in Catfish Row. Jabso Brown entertains the community with his piano playing. Clara sings a lullaby to her baby ("Summertime") as the working men prepare for a game of <a href="/wiki/Craps.html" title="Craps">craps</a>. Clara's husband, Jake, tries his own lullaby ("A Woman is a Sometime Thing") with little effect. Porgy, a cripple and a beggar, enters on his goat cart to organize the game. Crown, a lowlife, and his woman Bess enter, and the game begins. Sportin' Life, the local supplier of "happy dust" (<a href="/wiki/Cocaine.html" title="Cocaine">cocaine</a>) and bootleg alcohol, also joins in. One by one, the players get crapped out, leaving only Robbins and Crown, who have become extremely drunk. When Robbins wins, Crown starts a fight, and eventually kills Robbins. Crown runs, telling Bess to fend for herself. The door is shut on her by most of the residents, except Porgy, who shelters her.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Scene 2 - Serena's Room, the following night.</b></li>
</ul>
<p>The mourners sing a spiritual to Robbins ("Gone, Gone, Gone"). To raise money for his burial, a saucer is placed on his chest for the mourners' donations ("Overflow"). A white detective enters, in a speaking voice telling Serena (Robbins' wife) that she must bury her husband soon, or his body will be given to medical students. He arrests Peter (a bystander), whom he will force to testify against Crown. Serena laments her loss in "My man's gone now." The undertaker enters, and agrees to bury Robbins as long as Serena promises to pay him back. Bess and the chorus finish the act with "Leavin' for the Promise' Lan'".</p>

<h3>Act II</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Scene 1 - Catfish Row, a month later, in the morning.</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Jake and the other fishermen prepare for work ("It take a long pull to get there"). Clara asks Jake not to go, and to come to a picnic, but he tells her that they desperately need the money. This causes Porgy to sing from his window about his outlook on life ("I got plenty o' nuttin'"). Sportin' Life waltzes around, selling cocaine, but soon incurs the wrath of Maria ("I hates yo' struttin' style"). A fraudulent lawyer, Frazier, arrives and farcically divorces Bess from Crown. Archdale, a white lawman, enters and informs Porgy that Peter will soon be released. The bad omen of a buzzard flies over Catfish Row, causing Porgy to sing "Buzzard keep on flyin' over".</p>
<p>As the rest of Catfish Row prepares for the picnic, Sportin' Life asks Bess to start a new life with him in New York; she refuses. Bess and Porgy are now left alone, and express their love for each other ("Bess, you is my woman now"). The chorus re-enters in high spirits as they prepare to leave for the picnic ("Oh, I can't sit down"). Bess leaves Porgy behind as they go off to the picnic. Porgy reprises "I got plenty o' nuttin'" in high spirits.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Scene 2 - Kittiwah Island, that evening.</b></li>
</ul>
<p>The chorus enjoys themselves at the picnic ("I ain't got no shame doin' what I like to do!"). Sportin' Life presents the chorus his cynical views on the Bible ("It ain't necessarily so"), causing Serena to chastise them ("Shame on all you sinners!"). Crown enters to talk to Bess, and he reminds her that Porgy is "temporary." Bess wants to leave Crown forever ("Oh, what you want wid Bess?") but Crown makes her follow him into hiding in the woods.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Scene 3 - Catfish Row, a week later, just before dawn.</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Jake leaves to go fishing with his crew, and Peter returns from prison. Bess is lying in Porgy's room, delirious. Serena prays to remove Bess's affliction ("Oh, doctor Jesus"). The Strawberry Woman and the Crab Man sing their calls on the street, and Bess soon recovers from her fever. Bess talks with Porgy about her sins ("I wants to stay here") before exclaiming "I loves you, Porgy." Porgy promises to protect her from Crown. The scene ends with the hurricane bell signaling an approaching storm.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Scene 4 - Serena's Room, dawn of the next day.</b></li>
</ul>
<p>The residents of Catfish Row drown out the sound of the storm with prayer. A knock is heard at the door, and the chorus believes it to be Death ("Oh there's somebody knocking at the door"). Crown enters dramatically, seeking Bess. The chorus tries praying to make Crown leave, causing him to goad them with the un-Christian "A red-headed woman make a choo-choo jump its track." Clara sees Jake's boat turn over in the river, and she runs out to try and save him. Crown says that Porgy is not a real man, as he cannot go out to rescue her from the storm. Crown goes himself, and the chorus finish their prayer. Clara dies in the storm, and Bess will now care for her baby.</p>

<h3>Act III</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Scene 1 - Catfish Row, the next night.</b></li>
</ul>
<p>The chorus mourns Clara and Jake ("Clara, don't you be downhearted"). Crown enters to claim Bess, and a fight ensures, which ends with Porgy killing Crown. Porgy exclaims to Bess "You've got a man now. You've got Porgy!"</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Scene 2 - Catfish Row, the next afternoon.</b></li>
</ul>
<p>A detective enters and talks with Serena and Maria about the murders of Crown and Robbins. They deny knowledge of Crown's murder, causing the detective to question an apprehensive Porgy. He asks Porgy to come and identify Crown's body. Sportin' Life tells Porgy that corpses bleed in the presence of their murderers, and the detective will use this to hang Porgy. Porgy refuses to identify the body, and is arrested for contempt of court. Sportin' Life forces Bess to take cocaine, and then tells her that Porgy will be locked up for a long time. He tells her that she should start a new life with him in New York with the dazzling "There's a boat dat's leavin' soon for New York". She shuts the door on his face, but he knows that doubt at Porgy's return will make her follow him.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Scene 3 - Catfish Row, a week later.</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Porgy returns to Catfish Row richer, after playing craps on the street with his loaded dice. He gives gifts to the residents, and does not understand why they all seem so downhearted. He sees Clara's baby is now with Serena and madly asks where Bess is. Maria and Serena tell him that Bess has run off with Sportin' Life to New York in the trio "Bess is gone." Porgy calls for his goat cart, and leaves for New York to find Bess in the closing song "Oh Lawd, I'm on my way".</p>

<h2>Compositional history</h2>
<p>Gershwin first expressed interest in composing the opera upon reading Heyward's <i>Porgy</i> in 1926, and quickly dispatched a letter to the author. Though initial meetings were promising, Gershwin was in no hurry to write the opera, and Heyward soon collaborated with Dorothy in writing a play named <i>Porgy</i>, which opened in 1927.</p>
<p>After consulting with Gershwin, Heyward sold the story rights to <i>Porgy</i> in the fall of 1932 to <a href="/wiki/Al_Jolson.html" title="Al Jolson">Al Jolson</a>, who had a desire to team with <a href="/wiki/Jerome_Kern.html" title="Jerome Kern">Jerome Kern</a> and <a href="/wiki/Oscar_Hammerstein_II.html" title="Oscar Hammerstein II">Oscar Hammerstein II</a> to create a musical on the subject with Jolson playing the lead role in <a href="/wiki/Blackface.html" title="Blackface">blackface</a>. Initial enthusiasm for the proposed musical soon waned, however, leaving Gershwin alone to conceive a staged version of the work.</p>

<h3>Crawford's Broadway revival</h3>
<p>The noted director and producer <a href="/wiki/Cheryl_Crawford.html" title="Cheryl Crawford">Cheryl Crawford</a> brought <i>Porgy and Bess</i> back to Broadway in 1942 with an even more drastically cut version of the opera than the first Broadway staging, making it much more like the musical theater Americans were used to hearing from Gershwin.

<h3>1952 production</h3>
<p>Blevins Davis and Robert Breen produced a revival in 1952 which restored much of the music cut away in 1942, along with many of the recitatives put back in place. But, with two condensed acts, it still was short of the full version composed by Gershwin, which had not yet been seen by the public. This tour however restored the work to its full operatic form, and <i>Porgy and Bess</i> was warmly received through Europe. <sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a  title="">[6]</a></sup> The <a href="/wiki/London.html" title="London">London</a> premiere took place on <a href="/wiki/October_9.html" title="October 9">October 9</a>, <a href="/wiki/1952.html" title="1952">1952</a> at the <a href="/wiki/Stoll_Theatre.html" title="Stoll Theatre">Stoll Theatre</a>, where it remained until <a href="/wiki/February_10.html" title="February 10">February 10</a>, <a href="/wiki/1953.html" title="1953">1953</a>. <sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a  title="">[7]</a></sup></p>

The small role of Ruby was played by a young <a href="/wiki/Maya_Angelou.html" title="Maya Angelou">Maya Angelou</a>. Price and Warfield met and wed while on the tour.</p>
<p>After a small tour of Europe financed by the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Department_of_State.html" title="United States Department of State">United States Department of State</a>, the production came to Broadway's <a href="/wiki/Ziegfeld_Theatre.html" title="Ziegfeld Theatre">Ziegfeld Theatre</a>.

<h3>Houston Grand's 1976 production</h3>
<p>During the 1960s and early 1970s, <i>Porgy and Bess</i> mostly languished on the shelves, a victim of its perceived condescending racism in a racially-charged time. Though new productions took place in 1961 and 1964 along with a <a href="/wiki/Vienna_Volksoper.html" title="Vienna Volksoper">Vienna Volksoper</a> premiere in 1965, these did little to change most Americans' opinions of the work.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Houston_Grand_Opera.html" title="Houston Grand Opera">Houston Grand Opera</a> production which opened on <a href="/wiki/September_25.html" title="September 25">September 25</a>, <a href="/wiki/1976.html" title="1976">1976</a> helped to turn the tide. For the first time, an American opera company had tackled the opera, not a Broadway production company. This production was based on Gershwin's original full score and did not incorporate the cuts and other changes that Gershwin himself had made before the New York premiere, but it allowed the public to take in the operatic whole as first envisioned by the composer. In this light, it became clear that <i>Porgy and Bess</i> was indeed an opera, not a serious piece of musical theatre. This production won the Houston Grand a <a href="/wiki/Tony_Award.html" title="Tony Award">Tony Award</a>—the only opera ever to receive one—and a <a href="/wiki/Grammy_Award.html" title="Grammy Award">Grammy Award</a>.</p>

<h3>Subsequent productions</h3>
<p>Another Broadway production was staged in 1983. After toying with the idea of staging the opera since the 1930s, the <a href="/wiki/Metropolitan_Opera.html" title="Metropolitan Opera">Metropolitan Opera</a> staged the work in 1985, opening on <a href="/wiki/February_6.html" title="February 6">February 6</a>. England's <a href="/wiki/Glyndebourne_Festival.html" title="Glyndebourne Festival">Glyndebourne Festival</a> tackled the work with a 1986 production. These productions were also based on the "complete score," without incorporating Gershwin's revisions. A semi-staged version of this production was performed at <a href="/wiki/The_Proms.html" title="The Proms">the Proms</a> in 1998. The centennial celebration of the Gershwin brothers from 1996–1998 included a new production as well.

<h2>Racial controversy</h2>
<p>From the outset, the opera's depiction of <a href="/wiki/African_American.html" title="African American">African Americans</a> attracted controversy. Problems with the racial aspects of the opera continue to this day. <a href="/wiki/Virgil_Thomson.html" title="Virgil Thomson">Virgil Thomson</a>, a white American composer, stated that "Folk lore subjects recounted by an outsider are only valid as long as the folk in question is unable to speak for itself, which is certainly not true of the American Negro in 1935."<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a  title="">[8]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Duke_Ellington.html" title="Duke Ellington">Duke Ellington</a> stated "the times are here to debunk Gershwin's lampblack Negroisms."<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a  title="">[9]</a></sup> Several of the members of the original cast later stated that they, too, had concerns that their characters might play into a stereotype that African Americans lived in poverty, took drugs and solved their problems with their fists.</p>
<p>A planned production by the Negro Repertory Company of <a href="/wiki/Seattle.html" title="Seattle">Seattle</a> in the late 1930s, part of the <a href="/wiki/Federal_Theater_Project.html" title="Federal Theater Project">Federal Theater Project</a>, had been cancelled because actors were displeased with what they viewed as a <a href="/wiki/Racism.html" title="Racism">racist</a> portrayal of aspects of African American life. The initial plan was that they would perform the play in a "<a href="/wiki/Negro.html" title="Negro">Negro</a> <a href="/wiki/Dialect.html" title="Dialect">dialect</a>", which these <a href="/wiki/Pacific_Northwest.html" title="Pacific Northwest">Pacific Northwest</a> African American actors did not speak, and were supposed to learn from a dialect coach. Florence James attempted a compromise of dropping the use of dialect pronunciations, but ultimately the production was canceled outright. <sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a  title="">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p>Another production of <i>Porgy and Bess</i>, this time at the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Minnesota.html" title="University of Minnesota">University of Minnesota</a> in 1939, ran into similar troubles. According to Barbara Cyrus, one of the few black students at the university at the time, members of the local African American community saw the play as "detrimental to the race" and as a vehicle that promoted racist <a href="/wiki/Stereotypes.html" title="Stereotypes">stereotypes</a>. The play was eventually cancelled due to pressure from the African American community, which saw their success as proof of the increasing political power of blacks in the <a href="/wiki/Twin_Cities.html" title="Twin Cities">Twin Cities</a>. <sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a  title="">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p>This belief that <i>Porgy and Bess</i> was racist gained strength with the <a href="/wiki/American_Civil_Rights.html" title="American Civil Rights">American Civil Rights</a> and <a href="/wiki/Black_Power.html" title="Black Power">Black Power</a> movements of the 1950s, <a href="/wiki/1960.html" title="1960">'60s</a> and <a href="/wiki/1970s.html" title="1970s">'70s</a>. In fact, as these movements advanced, <i>Porgy and Bess</i> was seen as more and more out of place. When the play was revived in the 1960s, social critic and African American educator <a href="/wiki/Harold_Cruse.html" title="Harold Cruse">Harold Cruse</a> called it, "The most incongruous, contradictory cultural symbol ever created in the Western World." <sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a  title="">[12]</a></sup> Author John Hope Franklin did not totally agree with this view, stating in his introduction to <i>Three Negro Classics</i> "Sportin' Life clowns but not for white audiences. Porgy's clowning is a deliberate frustration of white power. Porgy also plays Uncle Tom, but he is never servile and lives for no white master." <sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a  title="">[13]</a></sup></p>
<p>Gershwin’s all-black opera was also unpopular with some celebrated black artists. <a href="/wiki/Harry_Belafonte.html" title="Harry Belafonte">Harry Belafonte</a> declined to play Porgy in the late 1950s film version, so it was offered to <a href="/wiki/Sidney_Poitier.html" title="Sidney Poitier">Sidney Poitier</a> who regretted his choice ever after. Betty Allen, president of the Harlem School of the Arts, admittedly loathed the piece and <a href="/wiki/Grace_Bumbry.html" title="Grace Bumbry">Grace Bumbry</a>, who excelled in the 1985 Metropolitan Opera production as Bess, made the often cited statement: "I thought it beneath me, I felt I had worked far too hard, that we had come far too far to have to retrogress to 1935. My way of dealing with it was to see that it was really a piece of Americana, of American history, whether we liked it or not. Whether I sing it or not, it was still going to be there." <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.neh.gov/news/humanities/1997-11/porgy.html">[2]</a></p>
<p>Over time, however, the opera gained acceptance from the opera community and some (though not all<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a  title="">[14]</a></sup>) in the African American community. Maurice Press stated in 2004 that "<i>Porgy and Bess</i> belongs as much to the black singer-actors who bring it to life as it does to the Heywards and the Gershwins." <sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a  title="">[15]</a></sup> Indeed, Ira Gershwin stipulated that only blacks be allowed to play the lead roles when the opera was performed in the United States, launching the careers of several prominent opera singers.</p>
<p>During the era of <a href="/wiki/Apartheid.html" title="Apartheid">apartheid</a> in <a href="/wiki/South_Africa.html" title="South Africa">South Africa</a>, several South African theatre companies planned to put on all-white productions of Porgy and Bess. <a href="/wiki/Ira_Gershwin.html" title="Ira Gershwin">Ira Gershwin</a>, as heir to his brother, consistently refused to permit these productions to be staged.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Musical elements">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Musical_elements" id="Musical_elements"></a></p>
<h2>Musical elements</h2>
<p>In the summer of 1934, George Gershwin worked on the opera in <a href="/wiki/Charleston%2C_South_Carolina.html" title="Charleston, South Carolina">Charleston, South Carolina</a>. He drew inspiration from the James Island <a href="/wiki/Gullah.html" title="Gullah">Gullah</a> community, who he felt had traditions that were reminiscent of Africa. This research added to the authenticity of his work.</p>
<p>The music itself reflects his New York jazz roots, but also portrays southern black traditions. Gershwin modeled the pieces after each type of <a href="/wiki/Folk_song.html" title="Folk song">folk song</a> that the composer knew about; <a href="/wiki/Jubilee.html" title="Jubilee">jubilees</a>, <a href="/wiki/Blues.html" title="Blues">blues</a>, praying songs, street cries, work songs, and spirituals are blended with traditional <a href="/wiki/Aria.html" title="Aria">arias</a> and <a href="/wiki/Recitative.html" title="Recitative">recitatives</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to being influenced by New York jazz and southern black music, many biographers and contemporaries have noted that for many numbers Gershwin borrowed melodies from <a href="/wiki/Jewish_music.html" title="Jewish music">Jewish liturgical music</a>. Gershwin <a href="/wiki/Biographer.html" title="Biographer">biographer</a> <a  title="List of people by name: Jaa-Jab">Edward Jablonsky</a> has claimed that the melody to "It Ain't Necessarily So" was taken from the <a href="/wiki/Haftarah#Haftarah_cantillation.html" title="Haftarah">Haftarah blessing</a> <sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a  title="">[16]</a></sup>, and others have attributed it to the <a href="/wiki/Torah_reading.html" title="Torah reading">Torah blessing</a>. <sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a  title="">[17]</a></sup> Allusions to Jewish music have been detected by other observers as well. One musicologist detected 'an uncanny resemblance' between the folk tune <i>Havenu Shalom Aleichem</i> and the spiritual <i>It Take a Long Pull to Get There</i> <sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a  title="">[18]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The score made use of <a href="/wiki/Leitmotif.html" title="Leitmotif">leitmotifs</a>, which are introduced as the theme of a song. They themselves are not folk melodies, but draw inspiration from them in such a way that genuine folk music is recalled.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Use of leitmotif">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Use_of_leitmotif" id="Use_of_leitmotif"></a></p>
<h3>Use of leitmotif</h3>
<p>George Gershwin introduces leitmotifs early in the opera to establish characters musically, and uses an intertwining of these themes to show conflict between characters. The best example of this is after the aria "<i>There's a boat dat's leaving soon for New York</i>" in Act III Scene ii.</p>
<p>Bess' idea of Porgy is expressed by snippets their <a href="/wiki/Duet_%28music%29.html" title="Duet (music)">duet</a> "Bess, you is my woman now," in which they pledge their fidelity to one another:<br />
<a  class="image" title=""><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/01/PorgyAndBess_Extract_2.PNG/550px-PorgyAndBess_Extract_2.PNG" alt="" width="550" height="101" longdesc="/wiki/Image:PorgyAndBess_Extract_2.PNG" /></a> (<i><a  class="internal" title="PorgyAndBess Extract 2.ogg">Listen</a></i>)</p>
<p>Her idea of Sportin' Life is shown through snippets of his <a href="/wiki/Aria.html" title="Aria">aria</a> "There's a boat that's leavin' soon for New York" in which the drug peddler tries to persuade Bess to leave Catfish Row with him:<br />
<a  class="image" title=""><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/6f/PorgyAndBess_Extract_1.PNG/700px-PorgyAndBess_Extract_1.PNG" alt="" width="700" height="82" longdesc="/wiki/Image:PorgyAndBess_Extract_1.PNG" /></a> (<i><a  class="internal" title="PorgyAndBess Extract 1.ogg">Listen</a></i>)</p>
<p>Bess's difficult decision to follow him is represented by a conflict of these two melodies. The first is heard in a sparse and distant <a href="/wiki/Orchestration.html" title="Orchestration">orchestration</a>:<br />
<a  class="image" title=""><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/3b/PorgyAndBess_Extract_3.PNG/700px-PorgyAndBess_Extract_3.PNG" alt="" width="700" height="102" longdesc="/wiki/Image:PorgyAndBess_Extract_3.PNG" /></a> (<i><a  class="internal" title="PorgyAndBess Extract 3.ogg">Listen</a></i>)</p>
<p>Sportin' Life is sure that Bess will follow him, and the quiet cocaine motif is heard. Then his own song is heard in a dazzling, overblown <a href="/wiki/Orchestration.html" title="Orchestration">orchestration</a>, complete with swaggering rhythms:<br />
<a  class="image" title=""><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/b0/PorgyAndBess_Extract_5.PNG/700px-PorgyAndBess_Extract_5.PNG" alt="" width="700" height="213" longdesc="/wiki/Image:PorgyAndBess_Extract_5.PNG" /></a> (<i><a  class="internal" title="PorgyAndBess Extract 4.ogg">Listen</a></i>)</p>
<p>This contrast represents Sportin' Life's successful corruption of Bess's love for Porgy.</p>

Two years later, when the first Broadway revival occurred, <a href="/wiki/Decca_Records.html" title="Decca Records">Decca</a> rushed other members of the cast into the recording studio to record other selections not recorded in 1940. These two records were marketed as a two volume 78 rpm set "<a href="/wiki/Selections_from_George_Gershwin%27s_folk_opera_Porgy_and_Bess.html" title="Selections from George Gershwin's folk opera Porgy and Bess">Selections from George Gershwin's folk opera Porgy and Bess</a>". After LP's had begun to be manufactured in 1948, the recording was transferred to LP, and subsequently, to CD.</p>
<p>Although there was an initial feeling by members of the jazz community that a Jewish piano player and a white novelist could not adequately convey the plight of blacks in a 1930s Charleston ghetto, jazz musicians warmed up to the opera after twenty years. <a href="/wiki/Louis_Armstrong.html" title="Louis Armstrong">Louis Armstrong</a> and <a href="/wiki/Ella_Fitzgerald.html" title="Ella Fitzgerald">Ella Fitzgerald</a> recorded <a href="/wiki/Porgy_and_Bess_%28Armstrong_%26_Fitzgerald_album%29.html" title="Porgy and Bess (Armstrong &amp; Fitzgerald album)">an album in 1957</a> in which they sang and scatted Gershwin's tunes.

<p>In 1959, Columbia Masterworks released a soundtrack album of the film version of "Porgy and Bess", which had been made that year. It was not a complete version of the opera, nor was it even a complete version of the film soundtrack, which featured more music than could be contained on a single LP. The album remained in print until the early 1970's, when it was withdrawn from stores at the request of the Gershwin estate. It is the first stereo album of music from "Porgy and Bess" with an all-black cast. <a href="/wiki/Sammy_Davis%2C_Jr..html" title="Sammy Davis, Jr.">Sammy Davis, Jr.</a>, however, was under contract to another recording company, and his vocal tracks could not be used on the album. <a href="/wiki/Cab_Calloway.html" title="Cab Calloway">Cab Calloway</a> substituted for Davis on the soundtrack album.</p>
<p>In 1963, <a href="/wiki/Leontyne_Price.html" title="Leontyne Price">Leontyne Price</a> and <a href="/wiki/William_Warfield.html" title="William Warfield">William Warfield</a>, who had starred in the 1952 world tour of "Porgy and Bess", recorded their own album of excerpts from the opera for <a href="/wiki/RCA_Victor.html" title="RCA Victor">RCA Victor</a>. None of the other singers from that production appeared on that album, but <a href="/wiki/John_W._Bubbles.html" title="John W. Bubbles">John W. Bubbles</a>, the original Sportin' Life, substituted for Cab Calloway (who had played Sportin' Life onstage in the 1952 production). The 1963 recording of "Porgy and Bess" excerpts remains the only official recording of the score on which Bubbles sings Sportin' Life's two big numbers.</p>
<p>In 1951, Columbia Masterworks recorded a 3-LP album of what was then the standard performing version of "Porgy and Bess" - the most complete recording made of the opera up to that time. It was billed as a "complete" version, but was complete only insofar as that was the way the work was usually performed then. (Actually, nearly an hour was cut from the opera.) This album featured more of Gershwin's original <a href="/wiki/Recitatives.html" title="Recitatives">recitatives</a> and orchestrations than had ever been heard before on records. It was produced by <a href="/wiki/Goddard_Lieberson.html" title="Goddard Lieberson">Goddard Lieberson</a>, who was then committed to putting on LP shows that had not been recorded in that medium. The recording was conducted by Lehman Engel, and starred <a href="/wiki/Lawrence_Winters.html" title="Lawrence Winters">Lawrence Winters</a> and <a href="/wiki/Camilla_Williams.html" title="Camilla Williams">Camilla Williams</a>, both from the <a href="/wiki/New_York_City_Opera.html" title="New York City Opera">New York City Opera</a>. Several singers who had been associated with the original 1935 production and the 1942 revival of "Porgy and Bess" were finally given a chance to record their roles more or less complete. The album was highly acclaimed as a giant step in recorded opera in its time, and was re-released at budget price on the Odyssey label in the early 1970's. It has subsequently appeared on CD on Sony's Masterworks Heritage CD series, and on the Naxos label as well. The album is not sung in as directly "operatic" a style as later versions, treading a fine line between opera and musical theatre.</p>
<p>The first complete recording of the opera, with an all-black cast, was made by the <a href="/wiki/Cleveland_Orchestra.html" title="Cleveland Orchestra">Cleveland Orchestra</a> under <a href="/wiki/Lorin_Maazel.html" title="Lorin Maazel">Lorin Maazel</a> in 1976, in time for the U.S. Bicentennial. It starred Willard White singing his first Porgy, and <a href="/wiki/Leona_Mitchell.html" title="Leona Mitchell">Leona Mitchell</a> as Bess. The recording was praised by critics for its performance quality and racial significance, but at the same time was highly criticized by some for not bringing out the "jazzier" qualities of the score.This was the first recording to restore all the cuts that Gershwin had made, and every complete recording of the opera made since then has similarly restored them.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Porgy_and_Bess_%282006%29.html" title="Porgy and Bess (2006)">newest</a> (2006) complete recording of the opera was made by the <a href="/wiki/Nashville_Symphony_Orchestra.html" title="Nashville Symphony Orchestra">Nashville Symphony Orchestra</a> under <a href="/wiki/John_Mauceri.html" title="John Mauceri">John Mauceri</a> in <a href="/wiki/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> and features Alvy Powell as Porgy, Marquita Lister as Bess, <a href="/wiki/Nicole_Cabell.html" title="Nicole Cabell">Nicole Cabell</a> as Clara and Robert Mack as Sportin' Life. It was issued by <a href="/wiki/Decca_Records.html" title="Decca Records">Decca</a>.</p>
<p>Operatic purists have found the best recordings to be those produced by the <a href="/wiki/Houston_Grand_Opera.html" title="Houston Grand Opera">Houston Grand Opera</a> in 1977 and <a href="/wiki/Porgy_and_Bess_%28Glyndebourne_album%29.html" title="Porgy and Bess (Glyndebourne album)">the Glyndebourne album</a> from 1989.

<p>A <b><a href="/wiki/Porgy_and_Bess_%281959_film%29.html" title="Porgy and Bess (1959 film)">1959 film version</a></b> was produced by <a href="/wiki/Samuel_Goldwyn.html" title="Samuel Goldwyn">Samuel Goldwyn</a>, but plagued with problems. Rouben Mamoulian, who had directed the 1935 Broadway premiere, was hired to direct the film, but was subsequently fired in favor of director <a href="/wiki/Otto_Preminger.html" title="Otto Preminger">Otto Preminger</a> for daring to suggest that the film be made on location in <a href="/wiki/South_Carolina.html" title="South Carolina">South Carolina</a> after a fire on the sound stage destroyed the film's sets. Goldwyn, who never liked making films on location, considered Mamoulian's request a sign of disloyalty. Opera singers dubbed the songs for <a href="/wiki/Sidney_Poitier.html" title="Sidney Poitier">Sidney Poitier</a>'s Porgy and <a href="/wiki/Dorothy_Dandridge.html" title="Dorothy Dandridge">Dorothy Dandridge</a>'s Bess, as well as for <a  class="new" title="Ruth Attaway">Ruth Attaway</a>'s Serena and <a href="/wiki/Diahann_Carroll.html" title="Diahann Carroll">Diahann Carroll</a>'s Clara (although Ms. Carroll can sing, her voice was not considered operatic enough). The Gershwin estate was disappointed with the film, as the score was edited to make it more like a <a href="/wiki/Musical_theater.html" title="Musical theater">musical</a>. Much of the music was omitted from the film, and many of Gershwin's orchestrations were either changed or completely scrapped. It was shown on <a href="/wiki/Network_television.html" title="Network television">network television</a> in the U.S. only once, in 1967. It was pulled from release in 1974, and prints can now only be seen in film archives.</p>
<p>In 1993, the <a href="/wiki/Glyndebourne_Festival_Opera.html" title="Glyndebourne Festival Opera">Glyndebourne</a> stage production of "Porgy and Bess" was greatly expanded scenically and <a href="/wiki/Videotape.html" title="Videotape">videotaped</a> in a <a href="/wiki/Television.html" title="Television">television</a> studio. It was telecast by the BBC in England and by PBS in the United States. It was directed by <a href="/wiki/Trevor_Nunn.html" title="Trevor Nunn">Trevor Nunn</a> and featured a cast of American singers (with the exception of Willard White, who is Jamaican but sounded American, as Porgy. Cynthia Haymon sang the role of Bess.). Nunn's "opening up" of the stage production was considered highly imaginative, his cast both sang and acted well, and the three hour production retained nearly all of Gershwin's music, heard in the original 1935 orchestrations - including the opera's sung <a href="/wiki/Recitatives.html" title="Recitatives">recitatives</a>, which had occasionally been turned into spoken dialogue in earlier productions. The 1993 "Porgy and Bess" was subsequently released on <a href="/wiki/VHS.html" title="VHS">VHS</a> and <a href="/wiki/DVD.html" title="DVD">DVD</a>, and is, so far, the only version of the opera to appear in those formats. It has won far greater acclaim than the 1959 film, which was widely panned by most critics for allegedly not being entirely faithful to Gershwin's opera, for refining the language grammatically, and for being staged in what they called an "overblown" manner.</p>
<p>In 2002, the <a href="/wiki/New_York_City_Opera.html" title="New York City Opera">New York City Opera</a> telecast its new version of the Houston Opera production, from the stage of <a href="/wiki/Lincoln_Center.html" title="Lincoln Center">Lincoln Center</a>. This version featured far more cuts than the previous telecast, but, like all stage versions produced since 1976, used the sung recitatives and Gershwin's orchestrations.</p>
<p>While not an adaptation, <i><a href="/wiki/Sesame_Street.html" title="Sesame Street">Sesame Street</a></i> parodied the song "A Woman is a Sometime Thing" in season 36 of the show. <a href="/wiki/Hoots_the_Owl.html" title="Hoots the Owl">Hoots the Owl</a> sang to <a href="/wiki/Cookie_Monster.html" title="Cookie Monster">Cookie Monster</a> about how "A Cookie is a Sometimes Food".</p>

<h3>Suites</h3>
<p>Gershwin prepared an orchestral suite containing music from the opera after <i>Porgy and Bess</i> closed early on Broadway. Though originally titled "Suite from <i>Porgy and Bess</i>", Ira later renamed it "<b><a href="/wiki/Catfish_Row.html" title="Catfish Row">Catfish Row</a></b>".</p>
<p>In 1942 Robert Russell Bennett arranged a medley (rather than a suite) for orchestra which has often been heard in the concert hall, known as <i>Porgy and Bess: A Symphonic Picture.</i> It is based on Gershwin's original scoring, though for a slightly different instrumentation. <a href="/wiki/Morton_Gould.html" title="Morton Gould">Morton Gould</a> also arranged an orchestral suite in the 1950s.</p>
