Constitution of the United States</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>A <b>constitution</b> is a system, often <a href="/wiki/Codified.html" title="Codified">codified</a> as a written document, which establishes the rules and principles by which an organization, or political entity, is governed. In the case of countries this term refers specifically to a national constitution, which defines the fundamental <a href="/wiki/Politics.html" title="Politics">political</a> principles and establishes the <a href="/wiki/Power_%28sociology%29.html" title="Power (sociology)">power</a> and <a href="/wiki/Duty.html" title="Duty">duties</a> of each government. Most national constitutions also guarantee certain <a href="/wiki/Right.html" title="Right">rights</a> to the people. Historically, before the evolution of modern-style, codified national constitutions, the term <i>constitution</i> could be applied to any important <a href="/wiki/Law.html" title="Law">law</a> that governed the functioning of a <a href="/wiki/Government.html" title="Government">government</a>.</p>
<p>Constitutions are found in many organizations. They are found extensively in government, at <a href="/wiki/Supranational.html" title="Supranational">supranational</a> (e.g. <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_Charter.html" title="United Nations Charter">United Nations Charter</a>), <a href="/wiki/Nation.html" title="Nation">national</a> (e.g. <a href="/wiki/Constitution_of_Poland.html" title="Constitution of Poland">Constitution of Poland</a>), and <a href="/wiki/Administrative_division.html" title="Administrative division">sub-national</a> or <a href="/wiki/Provincial.html" title="Provincial">provincial</a> (e.g. <a href="/wiki/Maryland_Constitution.html" title="Maryland Constitution">Constitution of Maryland</a>) levels. They are found in many political groups, such as <a href="/wiki/Political_party.html" title="Political party">political parties</a> and <a href="/wiki/Pressure_group.html" title="Pressure group">pressure groups</a>, including <a href="/wiki/Trade_union.html" title="Trade union">trade unions</a> (labour unions). There are many non-political groups and entities that may have constitutions of a sort such as <a href="/wiki/Company_%28law%29.html" title="Company (law)">companies</a> and <a href="/wiki/Voluntary_association.html" title="Voluntary association">voluntary organisations</a>.</p>

<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Etymology">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Etymology" id="Etymology"></a></p>
<h2>Etymology</h2>
<p>The term <i>constitution</i> comes from <a href="/wiki/Latin.html" title="Latin">Latin</a>, referring to issuing any important law, usually by the Roman emperor. Later, the term was widely used in <a href="/wiki/Canon_law.html" title="Canon law">canon law</a> to indicate certain relevant decisions, mainly from the <a href="/wiki/Pope.html" title="Pope">pope</a>.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: General features">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="General_features" id="General_features"></a></p>
<h2>General features</h2>
<p>Generally, all constitutions confer specific powers to an organization on the condition that it abides by this constitution or charter limitation. The Latin term <i><a href="/wiki/Ultra_vires.html" title="Ultra vires">ultra vires</a></i> describes activities that fall outside an organisation's or <a href="/wiki/Legislative.html" title="Legislative">legislative</a> body's legal or constitutional authority. For example, a <a href="/wiki/Students%27_union.html" title="Students' union">students' union</a> may be prohibited as an organization from engaging in activities not concerning students; if the union becomes involved in non-student activities these activities are considered <i>ultra vires</i> of the union's charter. An example from the constitutional law of nation-states would be a provincial government in a federal state trying to legislate in an area exclusively enumerated to the federal government in the constitution. For example, in the United States, any attempt by a state legislature to ratify a treaty with a foreign nation would be considered <i>ultra vires</i> of Congress' constitutional authority, being contrary to the constitution. In both cases, "ultra vires" gives a legal justification for the forced cessation of such action, which would be enforced by the <a href="/wiki/Judiciary.html" title="Judiciary">judiciary</a> in government.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Governmental constitutions">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Governmental_constitutions" id="Governmental_constitutions"></a></p>
<h2>Governmental constitutions</h2>
<p>Most commonly, the term <i>constitution</i> refers to a set of rules and principles that define the nature and extent of government. Most constitutions seek to regulate the relationship between institutions of the state, in a basic sense the relationship between the executive, legislature and the judiciary, but also the relationship of institutions within those branches. For example, executive branches can be divided into a head of government, government departments/ministries, executive agencies and a <a href="/wiki/Civil_service.html" title="Civil service">civil service</a>/bureaucracy. Most constitutions also attempt to define the relationship between individuals and the state, and to establish the broad rights of individual citizens. It is thus the most basic law of an area from which all the other laws and rules are hierarchically derived; in some areas it is in fact called "<a href="/wiki/Basic_Law.html" title="Basic Law">Basic Law</a>".</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Key features">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Key_features" id="Key_features"></a></p>
<h3>Key features</h3>
<p>The following are features of democratic constitutions which have been identified by political scientists to exist, in one form or another, in virtually all national constitutions.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Codification">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Codification" id="Codification"></a></p>
<h4>Codification</h4>
<p>A fundamental classification is codification or lack of codification. A codified constitution is one that is contained in a single document, which is the single source of constitutional law in a state. The classic example of this is the <a href="/wiki/Constitution_of_the_United_States.html" title="Constitution of the United States">Constitution of the United States</a>. An uncodified constitution is one that is not contained in a single document, consisting of several different sources, which may be written or unwritten. The <a href="/wiki/Constitution_of_Australia.html" title="Constitution of Australia">Constitution of Australia</a> is an example of a constitution in which constitutional law mainly derives from a single written document, but other written documents are also considered part of the constitution. The <a href="/wiki/Constitution_of_the_United_Kingdom.html" title="Constitution of the United Kingdom">Constitution of the United Kingdom</a> is an example of an uncodified constitution which consists of both written and unwritten sources and has no single written fundamental document.</p>
<p>The term <i>written constitution</i> is used to describe a constitution that is entirely written, which by definition includes every codified constitution. However, some constitutions are entirely written but, strictly speaking, not entirely codified. For example, in the <a href="/wiki/Constitution_of_Australia.html" title="Constitution of Australia">Constitution of Australia</a>, most of its fundamental political principles and regulations concerning the relationship between branches of government, and concerning the government and the individual are codified in a single document, the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Australia. However, the presence of statutes with constitutional significance, namely the <a href="/wiki/Statute_of_Westminster.html" title="Statute of Westminster">Statute of Westminster</a>, as adopted by the Commonwealth in the <a href="/wiki/Statute_of_Westminster_Adoption_Act_1942.html" title="Statute of Westminster Adoption Act 1942">Statute of Westminster Adoption Act 1942</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/Australia_Act_1986.html" title="Australia Act 1986">Australia Act 1986</a> means that Australia's constitution is not contained in a single constitutional document. The <a href="/wiki/Constitution_of_Canada.html" title="Constitution of Canada">Constitution of Canada</a>, which evolved from the <a href="/wiki/British_North_America_Acts.html" title="British North America Acts">British North America Acts</a> until severed from nominal British control by the <a href="/wiki/Canada_Act_1982.html" title="Canada Act 1982">Canada Act 1982</a> (analogous to the Australia Act 1986), is a similar example.</p>
<p>The term <i>written constitution</i> is often used interchangeably with <i>codified constitution</i>, and similarly <i>unwritten constitution</i> is used interchangeably with <i>uncodified constitution</i>. As shown above, this usage with respect to written and codified constitutions can be inaccurate. Strictly speaking, <i>unwritten constitution</i> is never an accurate synonym for <i>uncodified constitution</i>, because all modern democratic constitutions consist of some written sources, even if they have no different technical status than ordinary statutes. Another term used is <i>formal (written) constitution</i>, for example in the following context: "The United Kingdom has no formal constitution". This usage is correct, but it should be construed to mean that the United Kingdom does not have a written constitution, not that the UK has no constitution of any kind, which would not be correct.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Codified constitution">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Codified_constitution" id="Codified_constitution"></a></p>
<h5>Codified constitution</h5>
<p>Most states in the world have a codified constitution. Only three nations, <a href="/wiki/Israel.html" title="Israel">Israel</a>, <a href="/wiki/New_Zealand.html" title="New Zealand">New Zealand</a> and the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom.html" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>, have uncodified constitutions as at <a href="/wiki/August.html" title="August">August</a> <a href="/wiki/As_of_2006.html" title="As of 2006">2006</a>. Codified constitutions - unlike uncodified constitutions, which are the product of an "evolution" of laws and conventions over centuries - are usually the product of dramatic political change, such as a <a href="/wiki/Revolution.html" title="Revolution">revolution</a>. For example, the US constitution was written and subsequently ratified less than 25 years after the <a href="/wiki/American_Revolution.html" title="American Revolution">American Revolution</a>. The process by which a country adopts a constitution is closely tied to the historical and political context driving this fundamental change. This becomes evident when one compares the elaborate convention method adopted in the United States with the <a href="/wiki/Douglas_MacArthur.html" title="Douglas MacArthur">MacArthur</a> inspired post war constitution foisted on Japan (see <a href="/wiki/Constitution_of_Japan.html" title="Constitution of Japan">Constitution of Japan</a>). Arguably the legitimacy (and often the longevity) of codified constitutions are tied to the process by which they are initially adopted.</p>
<p>The most obvious advantage of a codified constitution is the coherent and easily understood body of rules. A codified constitution at the least is simple to read, being a single document. Although (entrenched) codified constitutions are relatively rigid, codified constitutions still yield a potentially wide range of interpretations by <a href="/wiki/Constitutional_court.html" title="Constitutional court">constitutional courts</a> (see <a href="/wiki/Constitution#Constitutional_courts.html" title="Constitution">below</a>).</p>
<p>States that have codified constitutions normally give them supremacy over ordinary <a href="/wiki/Statute.html" title="Statute">statute</a> law. That is, if there is a conflict between a legal statute and the codified constitution, all or part of the statute can be declared <i><a href="/wiki/Ultra_vires.html" title="Ultra vires">ultra vires</a></i> by a court and struck down as <a href="/wiki/Constitutionality.html" title="Constitutionality">unconstitutional</a>. Second, an extraordinary procedure is required for <a href="/wiki/Constitutional_amendment.html" title="Constitutional amendment">constitutional amendments</a> that may involve obtaining ⅔ majorities in the national legislature, the consent of regional legislatures, a <a href="/wiki/Referendum.html" title="Referendum">referendum</a> process or some other procedure that makes obtaining a constitutional amendment more difficult than passing a simple law.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Uncodified constitution">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Uncodified_constitution" id="Uncodified_constitution"></a></p>
<h5>Uncodified constitution</h5>
<p>By contrast, in the <a href="/wiki/Westminster_System.html" title="Westminster System">Westminster</a> tradition which originated in <a href="/wiki/England.html" title="England">England</a>, uncodified constitutions include written sources but also unwritten <a href="/wiki/Constitutional_convention_%28political_custom%29.html" title="Constitutional convention (political custom)">constitutional conventions</a>, observation of <a href="/wiki/Precedent.html" title="Precedent">precedents</a>, <a href="/wiki/Royal_prerogative.html" title="Royal prerogative">royal prerogatives</a> <a href="/wiki/Convention_%28norm%29.html" title="Convention (norm)">custom</a> and tradition, such as always holding the General Election on Thursdays; together these constitute the <a href="/wiki/British_constitutional_law.html" title="British constitutional law">British constitutional law</a>. In the days of the <a href="/wiki/British_Empire.html" title="British Empire">British Empire</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Judicial_Committee_of_the_Privy_Council.html" title="Judicial Committee of the Privy Council">Judicial Committee of the Privy Council</a> acted as the constitutional court for many of the British colonies such as <a href="/wiki/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canada</a> and <a href="/wiki/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australia</a> which had federal constitutions.</p>
<p>In states using uncodified constitutions, the difference between constitutional law and <a href="/wiki/Statute.html" title="Statute">statutory</a> law (i.e. law applying to any area of governance) in legal terms is nil. Both can be altered or repealed by a simple majority in Parliament. In practice, democratic governments do not use this opportunity to abolish all civil rights, which in theory they could do, but the distinction between regular and constitutional law is still somewhat arbitrary, usually depending on the traditional devotion of popular opinion to historical principles embodied in important past legislation. For example, several <a href="/wiki/Acts_of_Parliament.html" title="Acts of Parliament">Acts of Parliament</a> such as the <a href="/wiki/English_Bill_of_Rights.html" title="English Bill of Rights">Bill of Rights</a>, <a href="/wiki/Human_Rights_Act_1998.html" title="Human Rights Act 1998">Human Rights Act</a> and, prior to the creation of Parliament, <a href="/wiki/Magna_Carta.html" title="Magna Carta">Magna Carta</a> are regarded as granting fundamental rights and principles which are treated as almost constitutional.</p>

<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Entrenchment">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Entrenchment" id="Entrenchment"></a></p>
<h4>Entrenchment</h4>
<p>The presence or lack of entrenchment is a fundamental feature of constitutions. Entrenchment refers to whether the constitution is legally protected from modification without a procedure of <a href="/wiki/Constitutional_amendment.html" title="Constitutional amendment">constitutional amendment</a>. Entrenchment is an inherent feature in most written constitutions. The US constitution is an example of an entrenched constitution, and the UK constitution is an example of a constitution that is not entrenched.</p>
<p>The procedure for modifying a constitution is often called <i><a href="/wiki/Constitutional_amendment.html" title="Constitutional amendment">amending</a></i>. Amending an entrenched constitution requires more than the approval of the national legislature, it requires wider acceptance. Sometimes, the reason for this is that the constitution is considered supreme law, such as according to the <a href="/wiki/Supremacy_clause.html" title="Supremacy clause">supremacy clause</a> in the US constitution. Regardless of whether a constitution has this technical status, all states with an entrenched constitution recognise the difference between constitutional law and ordinary statutory law <sup title="The text in the vicinity of this tag needs citation." class="noprint">[<a  title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><i>citation&#160;needed</i></a>]</sup>. Procedures for ratification of constitutional amendments vary between states. In a federal system of government, the approval of a majority of state/provincial legislatures may be required. Alternatively, a national referendum may be required in some states, such as in Australia.</p>
<p>In constitutions that are not entrenched, no special procedure is required for modification. In the small number of countries with un-entrenched constitutions, the lack of entrenchment is because the constitution is not recognised with any higher legal status than ordinary <a href="/wiki/Statutes.html" title="Statutes">statutes</a>. In the UK, for example, passing laws which modify sources of the constitution, whether they are written or unwritten, are passed on a simple majority in <a href="/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom.html" title="Parliament of the United Kingdom">Parliament</a>. The concept of "amendment" does not apply, as the constitution can be altered as easily in terms of procedure as any national law.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Distribution of sovereignty">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Distribution_of_sovereignty" id="Distribution_of_sovereignty"></a></p>
<h4>Distribution of sovereignty</h4>
<p>Constitutions also establish where sovereignty is located in the state. There are three basic types of distribution of sovereignty: federal, unitary and confederal. A <a href="/wiki/Federalism.html" title="Federalism">federal system of government</a> will inevitably have a constitution that recognizes the division of sovereignty between the centre and peripheral/provincial regions of the state. The <a href="/wiki/Canadian_Constitution.html" title="Canadian Constitution">Canadian Constitution</a> is an example of this, dividing power between the federal government and the provinces and territories. A unitary constitution recognises that sovereignty resides only in the centre of the state. In the UK, the constitutional doctrine of <a href="/wiki/Parliamentary_sovereignty.html" title="Parliamentary sovereignty">Parliamentary sovereignty</a> dictates than sovereignty is ultimately contained at the centre. Confederal constitutions are rare, and there is often dispute to whether so-called "confederal" states are actually federal. In a confederacy, sovereignty is located in peripheral regions/provinces and only limited power is granted to the centre. A historical example of a confederal constitution is the <a href="/wiki/Swiss_Federal_Constitution.html" title="Swiss Federal Constitution">Swiss Federal Constitution</a>.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Separation of powers">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Separation_of_powers" id="Separation_of_powers"></a></p>
<h4>Separation of powers</h4>
<p>Constitutions vary extensively as to the degree of <a href="/wiki/Separation_of_powers.html" title="Separation of powers">separation of powers</a>, usually meaning the constitutional separation of the executive, legislative and judicial branches of government. The United States constitution has a full <a href="/wiki/Separation_of_powers.html" title="Separation of powers">separation of powers</a>, with each branch having particular enumerated powers. For instance, Congress, the US legislature, has the power of <a href="/wiki/Impeachment.html" title="Impeachment">impeachment</a>, which cannot be exercised by another branch.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Lines of accountability">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Lines_of_accountability" id="Lines_of_accountability"></a></p>
<h4>Lines of accountability</h4>
<p>Lines of accountability are a common feature in all democratic constitutions. In presidential systems of government, such as the United States, and semi-presidential systems, such as France, department secretaries/ministers are accountable to the <a href="/wiki/President.html" title="President">president</a>, who has patronage powers to appoint and dismiss ministers. The president is accountable to the people in an election. In parliamentary systems, such as the United Kingdom and Australia, ministers are accountable to <a href="/wiki/Parliament.html" title="Parliament">Parliament</a>, but it is the <a href="/wiki/Prime_minister.html" title="Prime minister">prime minister</a> who appoints and dismisses them (in Westminster systems this power derives from the monarch, a component of Parliament). There is the concept of a <a href="/wiki/Vote_of_no_confidence.html" title="Vote of no confidence">vote of no confidence</a> in many countries with parliamentary systems, which means that if a majority of the legislature vote for a no confidence motion, then the government must resign, and a new one will be formed, or parliament will be dissolved and a general election called.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Façade Constitutions">edit</a>]</div>

<h4>Façade Constitutions</h4>
<p>Italian political theorist <a href="/wiki/Giovanni_Sartori.html" title="Giovanni Sartori">Giovanni Sartori</a> noted the existence of national constitutions which are a façade for authoritarian sources of power. While such documents may express respect for <a href="/wiki/Human_rights.html" title="Human rights">human rights</a> or establish an independent judiciary, they may be ignored when the government feels threatened or entirely dishonoured in practice. An extreme example was the <a href="/wiki/Constitution_of_the_Soviet_Union.html" title="Constitution of the Soviet Union">Constitution of the Soviet Union</a> that on paper supported <a href="/wiki/Freedom_of_assembly.html" title="Freedom of assembly">freedom of assembly</a> or <a href="/wiki/Freedom_of_speech.html" title="Freedom of speech">freedom of speech</a>; however, citizens who acted accordingly were summarily <a href="/wiki/Political_prisoner.html" title="Political prisoner">imprisoned</a>. (Incidentally, this led to a famous <a href="/wiki/Radio_Yerevan.html" title="Radio Yerevan">Radio Yerevan</a> joke: <i>Someone asked Armenian Radio: What is the difference between the Constitutions of the USA and USSR? Both guarantee freedom of speech.</i> <i>Armenian Radio answered: In principle yes, but the Constitution of the USA also guarantees freedom</i> after <i>the speech</i>). The example demonstrates that the protections and benefits of a constitution are provided less through its written terms, but more through deference by government and society to its principles.</p>

<h2>Constitutional courts</h2>
<p>The constitution is often protected by a certain legal body in each country with various names, such as <i>supreme</i>, <i>constitutional</i> or <i>high</i> court. This court judges the compatibility of legislation with the provisions and principles of the constitution, which is termed "constitutionality". Especially important is the court's responsibility to protect constitutionally established rights and freedoms. In constitutions without the concept of supreme law, such as the United Kingdom constitution, the concept of "constitutionality" has little meaning, and constitutional courts do not exist.</p>
<p>A "constitutional violation" is an action or legislative act that is judged by a constitutional court to be contrary to the constitution, that is, "unconstitutional". An example of constitutional violation by the executive could be a <a href="/wiki/Politician.html" title="Politician">politician</a> who abuses the powers of his constitutionally-established office. An example of constitutional violation by the legislature is an attempt to pass a law that would contradict the constitution, without first going through the proper <a href="/wiki/Constitutional_amendment.html" title="Constitutional amendment">constitutional amendment</a> process.</p>
<p>A constitutional court is normally the <a href="/wiki/Court_of_last_resort.html" title="Court of last resort">court of last resort</a>, the highest judicial body in the government. The process of <a href="/wiki/Judicial_review.html" title="Judicial review">judicial review</a> is then integrated into the system of <a href="/wiki/Court_of_appeals.html" title="Court of appeals">courts of appeal</a>. This is the case, for example, with the <a href="/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States.html" title="Supreme Court of the United States">Supreme Court of the United States</a>. Cases must normally be heard in lower courts before being brought before the Supreme Court, except cases for which the Supreme Court has <a href="/wiki/Original_jurisdiction.html" title="Original jurisdiction">original jurisdiction</a>. Some other countries dedicate a special court solely to the protection of the constitution, as with the <a href="/wiki/Federal_Constitutional_Court_of_Germany.html" title="Federal Constitutional Court of Germany">German Constitutional Court</a>. Most constitutional courts are powerful instruments of judicial review, with the power to declare laws "unconstitutional", that is, incompatible with the constitution. The effect of this ruling varies between governments, but it is common for the courts' action to rule a law unenforceable, as is the case in the United States. However, many courts have the problem of relying on the legislative and executive branches' co-operation to properly enforce their decisions. For example, in the United States, the Supreme Court's ruling overturning the "separate but equal" doctrine in the 1950s depended on individual states co-operation to enforce. Some failed to do so, prompting the federal government to intervene. Other countries, such as France, have a <a href="/wiki/Constitutional_Council_of_France.html" title="Constitutional Council of France">Constitutional Council of France</a> which may only judge the constiutionality of laws before the ratification process.</p>
<p>Some countries, mainly those with uncodified constitutions, have no such courts at all – for example, as the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom.html" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> traditionally functions under the principle of <a href="/wiki/Parliamentary_sovereignty.html" title="Parliamentary sovereignty">parliamentary sovereignty</a>: the legislature has the power to enact any law it wishes. However, through its membership in the <a href="/wiki/European_Union.html" title="European Union">European Union</a>, the UK is now subject to the jurisdiction of <a href="/wiki/European_Community_law.html" title="European Community law">European Community law</a> and the <a href="/wiki/European_Court_of_Justice.html" title="European Court of Justice">European Court of Justice</a>; similarly, by acceding to the <a href="/wiki/Council_of_Europe.html" title="Council of Europe">Council of Europe</a>'s <a href="/wiki/European_Convention_on_Human_Rights.html" title="European Convention on Human Rights">European Convention on Human Rights</a>, it is subject to the <a href="/wiki/European_Court_of_Human_Rights.html" title="European Court of Human Rights">European Court of Human Rights</a>. In effect, these bodies are constitutional courts that can invalidate or interpret UK legislation, first established as a principle by the <a href="/wiki/Factortame_case.html" title="Factortame case">Factortame case</a>.</p>

<h2>History and development</h2>
<p>Excavations in modern-day <a href="/wiki/Iraq.html" title="Iraq">Iraq</a> by <a href="/wiki/Ernest_de_Sarzec.html" title="Ernest de Sarzec">Ernest de Sarzec</a> in 1877 found evidence of the earliest known code of justice, issued by the <a href="/wiki/Sumer.html" title="Sumer">Sumerian</a> king <a href="/wiki/Urukagina.html" title="Urukagina">Urukagina</a> of <a href="/wiki/Lagash.html" title="Lagash">Lagash</a> ca. 2300 BC. Perhaps the earliest prototype for a law of government, this document itself has not yet been discovered; however it is known that it allowed some <a href="/wiki/Right.html" title="Right">rights</a> to his citizens. For example, it is known that it relieved tax for widows and orphans, and protected the poor from the <a href="/wiki/Usury.html" title="Usury">usury</a> of the rich.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>After that, many governments ruled by special codes of written laws. The oldest such document still known to exist seems to be that of <a href="/wiki/Ur-Nammu.html" title="Ur-Nammu">Ur-Nammu</a> of <a href="/wiki/Ur.html" title="Ur">Ur</a> (ca. 2050 BC). Some of the more well known among these include the <a href="/wiki/Code_of_Hammurabi.html" title="Code of Hammurabi">code of Hammurabi</a> of <a href="/wiki/Babylonia.html" title="Babylonia">Babylonia</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Hittites.html" title="Hittites">Hittite</a> code, the <a href="/wiki/Assyria.html" title="Assyria">Assyrian</a> code, <a href="/wiki/Mosaic_law.html" title="Mosaic law">Mosaic law</a>, and likewise the commandments of <a href="/wiki/Cyrus_the_Great.html" title="Cyrus the Great">Cyrus the Great</a> of <a href="/wiki/Persia.html" title="Persia">Persia</a>.</p>
<p>In 621 BC, a scribe called <a href="/wiki/Draco.html" title="Draco">Draco</a> wrote the laws of the city-state of <a href="/wiki/Athens.html" title="Athens">Athens</a>; and being quite cruel, this code prescribed the death penalty for any offense. In 594 BC, <a href="/wiki/Solon.html" title="Solon">Solon</a>, the ruler of Athens, created the new <a href="/wiki/Solonian_Constitution.html" title="Solonian Constitution">Solonian Constitution</a>. It eased the burden of the workers, however it made the ruling class to be determined by wealth, rather than by birth. <a href="/wiki/Cleisthenes_of_Athens.html" title="Cleisthenes of Athens">Cleisthenes</a> again reformed the Athenian constitution and set it on a democratic footing in <a href="/wiki/508.html" title="508">508</a> BC.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Aristotle.html" title="Aristotle">Aristotle</a> (c. 350 BC) was one of the first in recorded history to make a formal distinction between law and constitutional law, establishing ideas of constitution and constitutionalism, and attempting to classify different forms of constitutional government. The most basic definition he used to describe a constitution in general terms was "the arrangement of the offices in a state". In his works <i><a href="/wiki/Constitution_of_Athens.html" title="Constitution of Athens">Constitution of Athens</a></i>, <a href="/wiki/Politics_%28Aristotle%29.html" title="Politics (Aristotle)">Politics</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Nicomachean_Ethics.html" title="Nicomachean Ethics">Nicomachean Ethics</a> he explored different forms of constitutions. He classified both what he regarded as good and bad constitutions, and came to the conclusion that the best constitution was a mixed system, including monarchic, aristocratic, and democratic elements. He also distinguished between citizens, who had the exclusive opportunity to participate in the state, and non-citizens and slaves who did not.</p>
<p>The Romans first codified their constitution in 449 BC as the <i><a href="/wiki/Twelve_Tables.html" title="Twelve Tables">Twelve Tables</a></i>. They operated under a series of laws that were added from time to time, but <a href="/wiki/Roman_law.html" title="Roman law">Roman law</a> was never reorganised into a single code until the <i><a href="/wiki/Codex_Theodosianus.html" title="Codex Theodosianus">Codex Theodosianus</a></i> (AD 438); later, in the Eastern Empire the <i><a href="/wiki/Codex_Justinianus.html" title="Codex Justinianus">Codex Justinianus</a></i> (534) was highly influential throughout Europe. This was followed in the east by the <i>Ecloga</i> of <a href="/wiki/Leo_III_the_Isaurian.html" title="Leo III the Isaurian">Leo III the Isaurian</a> (740) and the <i>Basilica</i> of <a href="/wiki/Basil_I.html" title="Basil I">Basil I</a> (878).</p>
<p>Many of the Germanic peoples that filled the power vacuum left by the Western Roman Empire in the <a href="/wiki/Early_Middle_Ages.html" title="Early Middle Ages">Early Middle Ages</a> codified their laws. One of the first of these <a href="/wiki/Germanic_tribal_laws.html" title="Germanic tribal laws">Germanic law codes</a> to be written was the Visigothic <i>Code of <a href="/wiki/Euric.html" title="Euric">Euric</a></i> (471). This was followed by the <i><a href="/wiki/Lex_Burgundionum.html" title="Lex Burgundionum">Lex Burgundionum</a></i>, applying separate codes for Germans and for Romans; the <i><a href="/wiki/Lex_Alamannorum.html" title="Lex Alamannorum">Pactus Alamannorum</a></i>; and the <a href="/wiki/Salic_Law.html" title="Salic Law">Salic Law</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Franks.html" title="Franks">Franks</a>, all written soon after 500. In 506, the <a href="/wiki/Breviary_of_Alaric.html" title="Breviary of Alaric"><i>Breviarum</i></a> or <i>"Lex Romana"</i> of <a href="/wiki/Alaric_II.html" title="Alaric II">Alaric II</a>, king of the Visigoths, adopted and consolidated the <i>Codex Theodosianus</i> together with assorted earlier Roman laws. Systems that appeared somewhat later include the <i><a href="/wiki/Edictum_Rothari.html" title="Edictum Rothari">Edictum Rothari</a></i> of the <a href="/wiki/Lombards.html" title="Lombards">Lombards</a> (643), the <i><a href="/wiki/Lex_Visigothorum.html" title="Lex Visigothorum">Lex Visigothorum</a></i> (654), the <i><a href="/wiki/Lex_Alamannorum.html" title="Lex Alamannorum">Lex Alamannorum</a></i> (730) and the <i><a href="/wiki/Lex_Frisionum.html" title="Lex Frisionum">Lex Frisionum</a></i> (c. 785).</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Japan.html" title="Japan">Japan</a>'s <i><a href="/wiki/Seventeen-article_constitution.html" title="Seventeen-article constitution">Seventeen-article constitution</a></i> written in <a href="/wiki/604.html" title="604">604</a>, reportedly by <a href="/wiki/Prince_Shotoku.html" title="Prince Shotoku">Prince Shōtoku</a>, is an early example of a constitution in Asian political history. Influenced by <a href="/wiki/Buddhism.html" title="Buddhism">Buddhist</a> teachings, the document focuses more on social morality than institutions of government <i>per se</i> and remains a notable early attempt at a government constitution. Another is the <i><a href="/wiki/Constitution_of_Medina.html" title="Constitution of Medina">Constitution of Medina</a></i>, drafted by the prophet of <a href="/wiki/Islam.html" title="Islam">Islam</a>, <a href="/wiki/Muhammad.html" title="Muhammad">Muhammad</a>, in <a href="/wiki/622.html" title="622">622</a>.</p>

<p>This provision became the cornerstone of English liberty after that point. The <a href="/wiki/Social_contract.html" title="Social contract">social contract</a> in the original case was between the king and the nobility, but was gradually extended to all of the people.

<p>Between 1220 and 1230, a Saxon administrator, Eike von Repgow, composed the <i><a href="/wiki/Sachsenspiegel.html" title="Sachsenspiegel">Sachsenspiegel</a></i>, which became the supreme law used in parts of Germany as late as 1900.</p>
<p>In 1236, <a href="/wiki/Sundiata_Keita.html" title="Sundiata Keita">Sundiata Keita</a> presented an oral constitution federating the <a href="/wiki/Mali_Empire.html" title="Mali Empire">Mali Empire</a>, called the <i><a href="/wiki/Kouroukan_Fouga.html" title="Kouroukan Fouga">Kouroukan Fouga</a></i>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, around 1240, the <a href="/wiki/Copt.html" title="Copt">Coptic</a> Egyptian Christian writer, <a  class="new" title="'Abul Fada'il Ibn al-'Assal">'Abul Fada'il Ibn al-'Assal</a>, wrote the <i><a href="/wiki/Fetha_Negest.html" title="Fetha Negest">Fetha Negest</a></i> in <a href="/wiki/Arabic_language.html" title="Arabic language">Arabic</a>. 'Ibn al-Assal took his laws partly from apostolic writings and Mosaic law, and partly from the former Byzantine codes. There are a few historical records claiming that this law code was translated into <a href="/wiki/Ge%27ez.html" title="Ge'ez">Ge'ez</a> and entered Ethiopia around <a href="/wiki/1450.html" title="1450">1450</a> in the reign of <a href="/wiki/Zara_Yaqob.html" title="Zara Yaqob">Zara Yaqob</a>. Even so, its first recorded use in the function of a constitution (supreme law of the land) is with <a href="/wiki/Sarsa_Dengel.html" title="Sarsa Dengel">Sarsa Dengel</a> beginning in 1563. The <i>Fetha Negest</i> remained the supreme law in Ethiopia until 1931, when a modern-style Constitution was first granted by Emperor <a href="/wiki/Haile_Selassie.html" title="Haile Selassie">Haile Selassie</a> I.</p>
<p>The earliest written constitution still governing a sovereign nation today may be that of <a href="/wiki/San_Marino.html" title="San Marino">San Marino</a>. The <i><a href="/wiki/Constitution_of_San_Marino.html" title="Constitution of San Marino">Leges Statutae Republicae Sancti Marini</a></i> was written in <a href="/wiki/Latin.html" title="Latin">Latin</a> and consists of six books. The first book, with 62 articles, establishes councils, courts, various executive officers and the powers assigned to them. The remaining books cover criminal and civil <a href="/wiki/Law.html" title="Law">law</a>, judicial procedures and remedies. Written in <a href="/wiki/1600.html" title="1600">1600</a>, the document was based upon the <i>Statuti Comunali</i> (Town Statute) of <a href="/wiki/1300.html" title="1300">1300</a>, itself influenced by the <i>Codex Justinianus</i>, and it remains in force today.</p>
<p>In 1639, the <a href="/wiki/Colony_of_Connecticut.html" title="Colony of Connecticut">Colony of Connecticut</a> adopted the <a href="/wiki/Fundamental_Orders.html" title="Fundamental Orders">Fundamental Orders</a>, which is considered the first North American constitution, and is the basis for every new Connecticut constitution since, and is also the reason for <a href="/wiki/Connecticut.html" title="Connecticut">Connecticut</a>'s nickname, the <a  class="new" title="Constitution State">Constitution State</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Massachusetts.html" title="Massachusetts">Commonwealth of Massachusetts</a> adopted its constitution in <a href="/wiki/1780.html" title="1780">1780</a>, before the ratification of the <a href="/wiki/Articles_of_Confederation.html" title="Articles of Confederation">Articles of Confederation</a> and the United States Constitution. It is probably the oldest still-functioning <i>nominal</i> constitution, that is, where the document specifically declares itself to be a constitution.
