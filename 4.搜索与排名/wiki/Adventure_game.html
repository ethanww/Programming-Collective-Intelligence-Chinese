<p><b>Adventure</b> is a genre of <a href="/wiki/Video_game.html" title="Video game">video game</a> typified by exploration, <a href="/wiki/Puzzle.html" title="Puzzle">puzzle</a>-solving, interaction with game characters, and a focus on <a href="/wiki/Narrative.html" title="Narrative">narrative</a> rather than reflex-based challenges. The vast majority of adventure games are <a href="/wiki/Personal_computer_game.html" title="Personal computer game">computer games</a>, though <a href="/wiki/Console_game.html" title="Console game">console</a>-based adventure games are not unheard of. Unlike many other game genres, the adventure genre's focus on story allows it to draw heavily from other narrative-based art forms, such as <a href="/wiki/Literature.html" title="Literature">literature</a> and <a href="/wiki/Film.html" title="Film">film</a>. Adventure games encompass a wide variety of literary genres, including <a href="/wiki/Fantasy.html" title="Fantasy">fantasy</a>, <a href="/wiki/Science_fiction.html" title="Science fiction">science fiction</a>, <a href="/wiki/Mystery_fiction.html" title="Mystery fiction">mystery</a>, <a href="/wiki/Horror_fiction.html" title="Horror fiction">horror</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Comedy.html" title="Comedy">comedy</a>. Notable adventure games include <i><a href="/wiki/Zork.html" title="Zork">Zork</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/King%27s_Quest.html" title="King's Quest">King's Quest</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/The_Secret_of_Monkey_Island.html" title="The Secret of Monkey Island">The Secret of Monkey Island</a></i>, and <i><a href="/wiki/Myst.html" title="Myst">Myst</a></i>.</p>
<p>Adventure games are similar to <a href="/wiki/Computer_role-playing_game.html" title="Computer role-playing game">computer role-playing games</a> (CRPG's), except that the <a href="/wiki/Game_play.html" title="Game play">game play</a> is more focused on <a href="/wiki/Problem-solving.html" title="Problem-solving">problem-solving</a> rather than combat and statistics. In general, games that involve the management of player attributes and statistics are considered to be CRPG's, while those that focus solely on puzzles and narrative are considered to be part of the Adventure category. It should be noted, however, that this distinction is an extremely loose one, and many games blur the line between the two categories. In particular, the status of what are sometimes called <a href="/wiki/Action-adventure_game.html" title="Action-adventure game">action-adventure games</a> as members of the category is largely in doubt, with adventure gaming purists (and, to a lesser extent, action gaming purists) labeling action-adventure games as belonging to neither the action nor adventure genres rather than to both.</p>
<p>Most adventure games are designed for a single player, since the heavy emphasis on story and character makes multi-player design difficult.</p>
<p>The adventure genre was quite popular during the late <a href="/wiki/1980s.html" title="1980s">1980s</a> and early <a href="/wiki/1990s.html" title="1990s">1990s</a>, and many considered it to be among the most technically advanced genres. Indeed, adventure companies like <a href="/wiki/Sierra_Entertainment.html" title="Sierra Entertainment">Sierra</a> pursued technologies for their games (such as hand-drawn backgrounds, rotoscoped animation, and in-game video) that were more advanced than most other genres at the time. However, the release of the <a href="/wiki/Sony_PlayStation.html" title="Sony PlayStation">Sony PlayStation</a> marked the end of the adventure game era; as 3D became the dominant graphics format, the mostly 2D adventure market began to shrink. While few developers continue to produce adventure games, some still are being released, and the adventure game genre has had some elements carry over into other genres.</p>

<h3>Colossal Cave Adventure</h3>
<p>In the early <a href="/wiki/1970s.html" title="1970s">1970s</a>, programmer, caver, and role-player <a href="/wiki/William_Crowther.html" title="William Crowther">William Crowther</a> developed a program called <i><a href="/wiki/Colossal_Cave_Adventure.html" title="Colossal Cave Adventure">Colossal Cave Adventure</a></i>. An employee at <a href="/wiki/Bolt%2C_Beranek_and_Newman.html" title="Bolt, Beranek and Newman">Bolt, Beranek and Newman</a> (BB&amp;N), a <a href="/wiki/Boston.html" title="Boston">Boston</a> company involved with <a href="/wiki/ARPANET.html" title="ARPANET">ARPANET</a> <a href="/wiki/Router.html" title="Router">routers</a>, Crowther used BBN's <a href="/wiki/PDP-10.html" title="PDP-10">PDP-10</a> to create the game. The game used a text interface to create an interactive adventure through a spectacular underground cave system. Crowther's work was later modified and expanded by programmer <a href="/wiki/Don_Woods.html" title="Don Woods">Don Woods</a>, and Colossal Cave Adventure became wildly popular among early computer enthusiasts, spreading across the nascent ARPANET throughout the 1970s.</p>
<p>The unique combination of Crowther's realistic cave descriptions and Woods' addition of fantastical elements proved immensely appealing, and defined the adventure game genre for decades to come. Swords, magic words, puzzles involving objects, and vast underground realms would all become staples of the <a href="/wiki/Interactive_fiction.html" title="Interactive fiction">text adventure</a> genre.</p>
<p>The "Armchair adventure" soon spread beyond college campuses as the <a href="/wiki/Microcomputer.html" title="Microcomputer">microcomputing</a> movement gained steam. Numerous home-brew knockoff's and variations on Colossal Cave Adventure (which eventually came to be known as simply <i>Adventure</i>) appeared throughout the late 1970s and early 1980s.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Scott Adams">edit</a>]</div>

<h3>Scott Adams</h3>
<p>One of the many fans of the Colossal Cave was programmer <a href="/wiki/Scott_Adams_%28game_designer%29.html" title="Scott Adams (game designer)">Scott Adams</a>. Upon his first introduction to Adventure, Adams spent almost ten days traversing the game before he achieved Grand Master status. Once he had completed the game, Adams began to wonder how a game like Colossal Cave Adventure could be developed on a home computer like his <a href="/wiki/TRS-80.html" title="TRS-80">TRS-80</a>. The main obstacle was that home computers such as the TRS-80 did not actually have sufficient memory to run a large game like Adventure. However, Adams hit on the idea that an adventure game executable could be divided into code written in a <a href="/wiki/High-level_programming_language.html" title="High-level programming language">high-level language</a> and an <a href="/wiki/Interpreter_%28computing%29.html" title="Interpreter (computing)">interpreter</a>, much like the way <a href="/wiki/BASIC_programming_language.html" title="BASIC programming language">BASIC</a> is often implemented. Furthermore, once an interpreter was developed, Adams realized that it could be reused to develop other adventure games. (For more information: <a  class="external text" title="http://www.alphaworks.com.au/scottadams/series.htm">Details of Adams's early work</a>.)</p>
<p>In 1978, Adams founded <a href="/wiki/Adventure_International.html" title="Adventure International">Adventure International</a> and produced twelve adventure games before the company went bankrupt in 1985. His first games were text-based and written in BASIC, but during his third game (<i>Mission Impossible</i>), Adams began programming in <a href="/wiki/Assembly_language.html" title="Assembly language">assembly language</a> to improve the speed of his software.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Graphical progress">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Graphical_progress" id="Graphical_progress"></a></p>
<h3>Graphical progress</h3>
<p>The great advance which immediately followed was the introduction of images. With the use of <a href="/wiki/Machine_language.html" title="Machine language">machine language</a> allowing shorter programs, and computer memory increasing, it became possible to use the graphical potential of a computer like the <a href="/wiki/Apple_II.html" title="Apple II">Apple II</a> and some companies soon switched from producing pure text-based adventure games.</p>
<p>Soon the clumsy basic <a href="/wiki/Vector_graphics.html" title="Vector graphics">vector graphics</a> gave way to more aesthetic imagery drawn by professional artists. Examples include:</p>
<ul>
<li><i><a  class="new" title="Return of Herakles">Return of Herakles</a></i> by <a href="/wiki/Stuart_Smith_%28game_designer%29.html" title="Stuart Smith (game designer)">Stuart Smith</a> (1982) (which faithfully portrayed <a href="/wiki/Greek_mythology.html" title="Greek mythology">Greek mythology</a>)</li>
<li><i><a  class="new" title="Sherwood Forest (Computer game)">Sherwood Forest</a></i> (1982),</li>
<li><a  class="new" title="Dale Johnson">Dale Johnson</a>'s <i><a  class="new" title="Masquerade (Computer game)">Masquerade</a></i> (1983),</li>
<li><a  class="new" title="Antonio Antiochia">Antonio Antiochia</a>'s <i><a href="/wiki/Transylvania_%28computer_game%29.html" title="Transylvania (computer game)">Transylvania</a></i> (1982, re-released in 1984)</li>
<li>Stuart Smith's follow-up to <i>Herakles</i>, <a href="/wiki/Adventure_Construction_Set.html" title="Adventure Construction Set">Adventure Construction Set</a> (1985), one of the early hits of <a href="/wiki/Electronic_Arts.html" title="Electronic Arts">Electronic Arts</a>. The full-length adventure that came with the software, <i>Rivers of Light</i>, was based on the legend of <a href="/wiki/Gilgamesh.html" title="Gilgamesh">Gilgamesh</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The introduction of such high-quality <a href="/wiki/Bitmap_graphics.html" title="Bitmap graphics">bitmap graphics</a> required more substantial storage capacity with many adventure games requiring several <a href="/wiki/Diskette.html" title="Diskette">diskettes</a> for installation, which would be the case until the <a href="/wiki/CD-ROM.html" title="CD-ROM">CD-ROM</a> made its appearance.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Infocom">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Infocom" id="Infocom"></a></p>
<h3>Infocom</h3>
<p>In 1977, two friends <a href="/wiki/Dave_Lebling.html" title="Dave Lebling">Dave Lebling</a> and <a href="/wiki/Marc_Blank.html" title="Marc Blank">Marc Blank</a>, who were students at the <a href="/wiki/Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology.html" title="Massachusetts Institute of Technology">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a>'s Laboratory for Computer Science, discovered Crowther and Woods's game <i>Colossal Cave Adventure</i>. After completing the adventure game, they were joined by <a href="/wiki/Tim_Anderson_%28Zork%29.html" title="Tim Anderson (Zork)">Tim Anderson</a> and <a href="/wiki/Bruce_Daniels.html" title="Bruce Daniels">Bruce Daniels</a> and began to develop a similar game. Their first production, <i><a href="/wiki/Zork.html" title="Zork">Zork</a></i>, also started on a PDP-10 minicomputer and spread quickly across the ARPANET. Its success was immediate, and the game, which would reach the size of a <a href="/wiki/Megabyte.html" title="Megabyte">megabyte</a>, enormous for the time, would be updated until 1981.</p>
<p>On graduation, the students decided to stay together and to form a company. Tim Anderson, Joel Berez, Marc Blank, Mike Broos, Scott Cutler, Stu Galley, Dave Lebling, J. C. R. Licklider, Chris Reeve, and Albert Vezza created <a href="/wiki/Infocom.html" title="Infocom">Infocom</a> on <a href="/wiki/June_22.html" title="June 22">22 June</a> <a href="/wiki/1979.html" title="1979">1979</a>. The idea of distributing Zork came to mind very soon, but the game was too big to port to the microcomputers of the time: the Apple II and the TRS-80, the potential targets, each had only 16 kb of RAM. They solved this problem by breaking up the game into three episodes.</p>
<p>They wrote a special programming language called <a href="/wiki/ZIL.html" title="ZIL">ZIL</a> (<i>Zork Implementation Language</i>), which could function on any computer by using an emulator (the <a href="/wiki/Z-machine.html" title="Z-machine">Z-machine</a>) as an intermediary.</p>
<p>In November <a href="/wiki/1980.html" title="1980">1980</a> the new <i><a href="/wiki/Zork_I.html" title="Zork I">Zork I</a>: The Great Underground Empire</i> was made available for the <a href="/wiki/PDP-11.html" title="PDP-11">PDP-11</a>; One month later, it was released for the <a href="/wiki/TRS-80.html" title="TRS-80">TRS-80</a>, with more than 1,500 copies sold between that date and September <a href="/wiki/1981.html" title="1981">1981</a>. That same year, Bruce Daniels finalized the Apple II version and more than 6,000 additional copies were sold. <i>Zork I</i> would go on to sell over a million copies.</p>
<p>The company continued developing text adventure games even as it opened a department for the development of professional software, a department which would never be profitable. High-quality games, with massive, intelligent plots, unequaled syntax analyzers, and meticulous documentation as integral parts of the game, succeeded in all genres. However, with the power of microcomputers increasing and the demand for graphics (which it refused to include in its games), Infocom saw sales decline and in <a href="/wiki/1989_in_video_gaming.html" title="1989 in video gaming">1989</a>, it had shrunk to a mere 10 employees, compared to 100 employees at its peak, and games developed after 1989 would have no link with the original team.</p>

<p>At the end of the 1970s, <a href="/wiki/Ken_Williams_%28gaming%29.html" title="Ken Williams (gaming)">Ken Williams</a> sought to set up a company for enterprise software for the market-dominating Apple II computer. One day, he took a <a href="/wiki/Teleprinter#Teleprinters_in_computing.html" title="Teleprinter">teletype terminal</a> to his residence to work on the development of an accounting program. Rummaging through a catalogue, he found a program called <i>Colossal Cave Adventure</i>. He and his wife <a href="/wiki/Roberta_Williams.html" title="Roberta Williams">Roberta</a> both played it all the way through and their encounter with Crowther's game would have a strong influence on video-gaming history.</p>
<p>Having finished <i>Colossal Cave Adventure</i>, they began to search for something similar, but found the market underdeveloped. Roberta Williams liked the concept of a textual adventure very much, but she thought that the player would have a more satisfying experience with images and began to think of her own game. She thus conceived <i><a href="/wiki/Mystery_House.html" title="Mystery House">Mystery House</a></i>, the first graphical adventure game, a detective story inspired by <a href="/wiki/Agatha_Christie.html" title="Agatha Christie">Agatha Christie</a>'s <i><a href="/wiki/Ten_Little_Niggers.html" title="Ten Little Niggers">And Then There Were None</a></i>.</p>
<p>Ken spent a few nights developing the game on his Apple II, and in the end they made packets with ziploc bags containing the game's 5¼-inch disk and a photocopied paper describing the game. They sold it via a local software shop and to their great surprise, <i>Mystery House</i> was an enormous success. Though Ken believed that the gaming market would be less of a growth market than the professional software market, he persevered with games. Thus, in 1980, the Williamses founded <i>On-Line Systems</i> which would become <i><a href="/wiki/Sierra_On-Line.html" title="Sierra On-Line">Sierra On-Line</a></i> in 1982. The company would be a major actor in the video-gaming of the 1980s.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>Sierra soon took things further. Until this point adventure games were in the first person; images presented the décor as seen through the eyes of the player. Williams's company would introduce a new feature in the <i><a href="/wiki/King%27s_Quest.html" title="King's Quest">King's Quest</a></i> series: a game in the third person. Taking advantage of the techniques developed in action games which had progressed in parallel, Ken introduced an animated character who represented the player in the game and whom the player controlled. With the <i><a  class="new" title="3D Animated Adventures">3D Animated Adventures</a></i>, a new standard was born, and nearly all the industry latched onto it. The commands were still entered on the keyboard and analyzed by a syntax interpreter, as with text adventure games.</p>
<p>Soon after, Sierra had multiple successful series of adventure games running, including <a href="/wiki/King%27s_Quest.html" title="King's Quest">King's Quest</a>, <a href="/wiki/Police_Quest.html" title="Police Quest">Police Quest</a>, <a href="/wiki/Space_Quest.html" title="Space Quest">Space Quest</a>, <a href="/wiki/Leisure_Suit_Larry.html" title="Leisure Suit Larry">Leisure Suit Larry</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Quest_for_Glory.html" title="Quest for Glory">Quest for Glory</a>, with each containing numerous games. A few years after these series had started, the classic graphics above the command cursor was fully replaced with "point and click" gameplay and VGA graphics. Their last and most critically acclaimed series was the <a href="/wiki/Gabriel_Knight.html" title="Gabriel Knight">Gabriel Knight</a> series, which began in 1993 and ended with Sierra's last adventure game in 1998.</p>
<p>Sierra would develop new games and push the boundaries of adventure gaming until its purchase by <a href="/wiki/Cendant.html" title="Cendant">Cendant</a> in 1998. Then in 1998, Cendant sold off their entire interactive software branch for $1 billion to <a  class="new" title="Havas Interactive">Havas Interactive</a>, a subsidiary of <a href="/wiki/Vivendi_Universal.html" title="Vivendi Universal">Vivendi Universal</a>.</p>

<h3>LucasArts</h3>
<p>In 1987, when nobody seemed able to overcome Sierra's power, a programmer named <a href="/wiki/Ron_Gilbert.html" title="Ron Gilbert">Ron Gilbert</a> working for the company <a href="/wiki/Lucasfilm.html" title="Lucasfilm">Lucasfilm</a> Games — which has since become <a href="/wiki/LucasArts.html" title="LucasArts">LucasArts</a> — created the script-writing system <a href="/wiki/SCUMM.html" title="SCUMM">SCUMM</a> which used a <a href="/wiki/Point-and-click.html" title="Point-and-click">point-and-click</a> interface similar to <a href="/wiki/ICOM_Simulations.html" title="ICOM Simulations">ICOM Simulations'</a> <a href="/wiki/MacVenture.html" title="MacVenture">MacVenture</a> games first introduced in 1985. Instead of having to type a command to the syntax analyzer, this system was controlled by means of text icons. To interact with his environment, the player clicked on an order, on an icon representing an object in her inventory, or on a part of the image. This approach was first used by LucasArts for the game <i><a href="/wiki/Maniac_Mansion.html" title="Maniac Mansion">Maniac Mansion</a></i> to great effect.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>LucasArts would come to differentiate itself from its main competitor, the giant Sierra, by rethinking certain adventure game concepts to improve playability. Gone was the possibility to die during the course of the game and everything was done to ensure that the player was never completely stuck. Finally, LucasArts abandoned the system of points indicating the player's progress in the adventure. These innovations were immediately taken into account by the competition, especially Sierra.</p>
<p>Gilbert's attempts, <i><a href="/wiki/Maniac_Mansion.html" title="Maniac Mansion">Maniac Mansion</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Zak_McKracken_and_the_Alien_Mindbenders.html" title="Zak McKracken and the Alien Mindbenders">Zak McKracken and the Alien Mindbenders</a></i>, however, remained in 16 colors, and the point-and-click engine wasn't completely integrated since the player would still have to construct sentences using clickable keywords combined with objects in the game. It was <i>The Secret Of Monkey Island</i> that was finally a complete work, with 256 colors, a complete point-and-click engine, a dialogue system with optional responses, puzzles solved with items, original graphics, atmosphere music, and a characteristic sense of humor. Above all, the script was written as for a film (which could be done in-house) and the dialogue and inventory served the needs of the script. The 1993 release of <i><a href="/wiki/Day_of_the_Tentacle.html" title="Day of the Tentacle">Day of the Tentacle</a></i>, a remarkable success, began a line of <a href="/wiki/Cartoon.html" title="Cartoon">cartoon</a>-style games, including the very influential <i><a href="/wiki/Sam_%26_Max_Hit_the_Road.html" title="Sam &amp; Max Hit the Road">Sam &amp; Max Hit the Road</a></i> as well as the acclaimed <i><a href="/wiki/Full_Throttle.html" title="Full Throttle">Full Throttle</a></i>, which also heralded the beginning of the end of the Golden Age of adventure games.</p>
<p>Steven Spielberg collaborated with LucasArts in the creation of <i><a href="/wiki/The_Dig.html" title="The Dig">The Dig</a></i> — a <a href="/wiki/Science-fiction.html" title="Science-fiction">science-fiction</a> adventure game that the director had envisioned turning into a film.</p>
<p>Taking advantage of advances in action games and integrating an engine similar to those of <a href="/wiki/First-person_shooter.html" title="First-person shooter">first-person shooters</a>, the company took a new turn in 1998 with the game <i><a href="/wiki/Grim_Fandango.html" title="Grim Fandango">Grim Fandango</a></i>, where it abandoned the cartoon style and its SCUMM scripting environment for a new 3D game system named <a href="/wiki/GrimE.html" title="GrimE">GrimE</a>.</p>

</div>
<p>In 1991 when the world of adventure games seemed forever dominated by Sierra and Lucas Arts, a small team of nine from the company <a href="/wiki/Cyan%2C_Inc..html" title="Cyan, Inc.">Cyan, Inc.</a>, headed by the brothers <a href="/wiki/Rand_Miller.html" title="Rand Miller">Rand</a> and <a href="/wiki/Robyn_Miller.html" title="Robyn Miller">Robyn Miller</a> and run out of a garage in <a href="/wiki/Spokane%2C_Washington.html" title="Spokane, Washington">Spokane, Washington</a>, began to push the limits of <a href="/wiki/Apple_Computer.html" title="Apple Computer">Apple</a>'s <a href="/wiki/HyperCard.html" title="HyperCard">HyperCard</a> software. By utilizing several <a href="/wiki/Macintosh_Quadra.html" title="Macintosh Quadra">Macintosh Quadra</a> computers to generate the graphic images, they invented a new type of adventure game, transforming the genre. Their game <i><a href="/wiki/Myst.html" title="Myst">Myst</a></i> was a first-person game with few animations, but the images completely left behind the prevailing cartoon style in favour of <a  class="new" title="Ultra-Realism">Ultra-Realism</a>. The game was intriguing and captivating, and allowed a level of immersion never previously attained.</p>
<p>The adventure began on an island; the player knew nothing. There was no inventory any more; the player could only carry one object at a time. The game's puzzles were rather classical in their conception. However, thanks to its detailed graphics where everything could be important, the game captivated the player.</p>
<p>Part of its success also seemed linked to the fact that, for the first time, a video game didn't appear to be aimed at an adolescent male audience, but a mainstream adult audience. Released in 1993, <i>Myst</i> for many years was the most profitable computer game ever; it sold over nine million copies on all platforms. It wasn't dethroned until the release of <i><a href="/wiki/The_Sims.html" title="The Sims">The Sims</a></i> in 2000, currently the most successful computer game ever.</p>
<p><i>Myst</i> gave way to several sequels, <i><a href="/wiki/Riven.html" title="Riven">Riven</a></i>, <i><a  title="Myst III: Exile">Myst III: Exile</a></i>, <i><a  title="Uru: Ages Beyond Myst">Uru: Ages Beyond Myst</a></i>,<i><a  title="Myst IV: Revelation">Myst IV: Revelation</a></i>, as well as <i><a  title="Myst V: End of Ages">Myst V: End of Ages</a></i>. In <i>Uru: Ages Beyond Myst</i> and <i>Myst V</i>, the graphics are in real-time 3D rather than being pre-rendered stills. Three derived novels found their origin in its world: <i><a  title="Myst: The Book of Atrus">Myst: The Book of Atrus</a></i>, <i><a  title="Myst: The Book of Ti'ana">Myst: The Book of Ti'ana</a></i> and <i><a  title="Myst: The Book of D'ni">Myst: The Book of D'ni</a></i>. The game was also parodied by <a href="/wiki/Parroty_Interactive.html" title="Parroty Interactive">Parroty Interactive</a>'s <i><a href="/wiki/Pyst.html" title="Pyst">Pyst</a></i>.</p>
<p>Note: Many adventure gamers argue whether or not Myst and similar puzzle games actually qualify as being adventure games. Similar to how "action adventure" games contain a strong focus on action sequences typically not frequent in adventure games, puzzle games don't focus much on storyline or character interaction, which many consider a vital component of adventure games.</p>

<h2>Types of adventure games</h2>
<p>There are many types of adventure games, depending on the criteria. Adventure games vary in their subject, interface, setting or plot. A definite categorization can't be done since some of them may belong to 2 or more of the below mentioned 'types'.</p>

<p><a name="Text_based" id="Text_based"></a></p>
<h3>Text based</h3>
<p>The first adventure games to appear were text adventures (later called <a href="/wiki/Interactive_fiction.html" title="Interactive fiction">interactive fiction</a>), which typically use a <a href="/wiki/Verb.html" title="Verb">verb</a>-<a href="/wiki/Noun.html" title="Noun">noun</a> <a href="/wiki/Parser.html" title="Parser">parser</a> to interact with the user. These evolved from early <a href="/wiki/Mainframe.html" title="Mainframe">mainframe</a> titles like <i><a href="/wiki/Hunt_the_Wumpus.html" title="Hunt the Wumpus">Hunt the Wumpus</a></i> (<a href="/wiki/Gregory_Yob.html" title="Gregory Yob">Gregory Yob</a>) and <i><a href="/wiki/Colossal_Cave_Adventure.html" title="Colossal Cave Adventure">Adventure</a></i> (<a href="/wiki/Will_Crowther.html" title="Will Crowther">Crowther</a> and <a href="/wiki/Don_Woods.html" title="Don Woods">Woods</a>) into commercial games which were playable on <a href="/wiki/Personal_computer.html" title="Personal computer">personal computers</a>, such as <a href="/wiki/Infocom.html" title="Infocom">Infocom</a>'s widely popular <i><a href="/wiki/Zork.html" title="Zork">Zork</a></i> series.

<h3>Graphical adventure</h3>
<p>Graphical adventure games were introduced by a new company called On-Line Systems, which later changed its name to <a href="/wiki/Sierra_Entertainment.html" title="Sierra Entertainment">Sierra On-Line</a>. After the rudimentary <i><a href="/wiki/Mystery_House.html" title="Mystery House">Mystery House</a></i> (1980) they established themselves with the full adventure <i><a href="/wiki/King%27s_Quest.html" title="King's Quest">King's Quest</a></i> (1984), appearing on various systems, and went on to further success with a variety of strong titles.</p>
<p>A number of games were released on <a href="/wiki/8-bit.html" title="8-bit">8-bit</a> <a href="/wiki/Home_computer.html" title="Home computer">home computer</a> formats in the 1980s that advanced on the text adventure style originated with games like <i>Colossal Cave Adventure</i> and, in a similar manner to Sierra, added moveable (often directly-controllable) characters to a parsar or input-system similar to traditional adventures. Examples of this are <a href="/wiki/Gargoyle_Games.html" title="Gargoyle Games">Gargoyle Games</a>'s <i><a href="/wiki/Heavy_on_the_Magick.html" title="Heavy on the Magick">Heavy on the Magick</a></i> (<a href="/wiki/1986.html" title="1986">1986</a>) which has a text-input system with an animated display screen, and the later <a href="/wiki/Magic_Knight.html" title="Magic Knight">Magic Knight</a> games such as <i><a href="/wiki/Spellbound_%28computer_game%29.html" title="Spellbound (computer game)">Spellbound</a></i> (<a href="/wiki/1985.html" title="1985">1985</a>) which uses a window-menu system to allow for text-adventure style input.</p>
<p>In 1984 a new kind of adventure games emerged following the launch of the <a href="/wiki/Apple_Macintosh.html" title="Apple Macintosh">Apple Macintosh</a> with its point-and-click interface. First out was the innovative but relatively unknown <a href="/wiki/Enchanted_Scepters.html" title="Enchanted Scepters">Enchanted Scepters</a> the same year, then in 1985 <a href="/wiki/ICOM_Simulations.html" title="ICOM Simulations">ICOM Simulations</a> released <i><a href="/wiki/Deja_Vu_%28video_game%29.html" title="Deja Vu (video game)">Deja Vu</a></i> that completely banished the text parser for a point-and-click interface. In 1987 the well-known second follow-up <i><a href="/wiki/Shadowgate.html" title="Shadowgate">Shadowgate</a></i> was released, and <a href="/wiki/LucasArts.html" title="LucasArts">LucasArts</a> also entered the field with <i><a href="/wiki/Maniac_Mansion.html" title="Maniac Mansion">Maniac Mansion</a></i> – a point-and-click adventure that gained a strong following. A prime example of LucasArts' work is the <a href="/wiki/Monkey_Island_series.html" title="Monkey Island series"><i>Monkey Island</i> series</a>.</p>

<p><a name="RPG-like" id="RPG-like"></a></p>
<h3>RPG-like</h3>
<p>Some adventure games rely equally on the common adventure elements, but also on the 'character building' of <a href="/wiki/Role_playing_game.html" title="Role playing game">RPGs</a>. The main character(s) usually has a certain "<a href="/wiki/Hit_point.html" title="Hit point">Hit point</a>" meter and a chart of skills. Some puzzles and feats need a minimum amount of skills in order to be solved (like <i>Climbing</i> above 5 to climb a tree and obtain a lost ring) so the player may have to choose one character over another to solve it, or spend time building the skills of the first character. As in RPGs, the games involve battles, the result of which depends on his character's skills and health (and on the player's reflexes in the case of real-time combat). However, these kinds of games don't belong to the 'Action adventure' above. Typical examples include <i><a href="/wiki/Quest_for_Glory.html" title="Quest for Glory">Quest for Glory</a></i> and <i><a  class="new" title="Final Battle (game)">Final Battle</a></i>.</p>

<p><a name="Puzzle_adventure" id="Puzzle_adventure"></a></p>
<h3>Puzzle adventure</h3>
<p>Adventure games that do not rely on obtaining items, their use, and character interaction belong to this genre. It emphasizes exploration, reading logs, and deciphering the proper use of complex mechanisms, often resembling <a href="/wiki/Rube_Goldberg.html" title="Rube Goldberg">Rube Goldberg machines</a>.</p>
<p>The plot of these games is usually obscure, and relies on the player's interpretation of the setting and the scenery, and information from the logs in order for him to understand the background scenario. Almost all of these games are played from a <a href="/wiki/First_person.html" title="First person">first person</a> perspective with the player "moving" between still pre-rendered 3D images, sometimes combined with short animations or video. Typical examples include <i><a  title="Schizm: Mysterious Journey">Schizm</a></i>, <i><a  class="new" title="Riddle of the Sphinx">Riddle of the Sphinx</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Myst.html" title="Myst">Myst</a></i>, which pioneered this game style.

<h3>Other</h3>
<p>A few adventure games have defined themselves as "original" because they distanced themselves from the main adventure genre and put focus on other elements. They are considered unique because they didn't develop into genres.</p>
<ul>
<li><i><a  title="King's Quest VIII: The Mask of Eternity">King's Quest VIII: The Mask of Eternity</a></i> (Sierra): Although it could be labelled as an action-adventure, <i>KQ8</i> was hard to define because the genre was not popular when it was released. Rather than relying solely on action, it combined many other elements including first-person and over-the-shoulder third-person views (the latter similar to that used in <i><a href="/wiki/Tomb_Raider.html" title="Tomb Raider">Tomb Raider</a></i>), riddles, dialogue, inventory and RPG elements such as an extensive array of weapons and collecting experience.</li>
<li><i><a  class="new" title="Hampstead (game)">Hampstead</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Terrormolinos.html" title="Terrormolinos">Terrormolinos</a></i> (Melbourne House): Written by Trevor Lever and Peter Jones, these games introduced a new element of satirical humour to adventure games in the mid-80s. Although <i>Hampstead</i> contained no graphics, it was of its time in lampooning social climbing. <i><a href="/wiki/Terrormolinos.html" title="Terrormolinos">Terrormolinos</a></i> required the player to survive a two-week family holiday in Spain, and contained simple Donald McGill-style graphics which imitated Polaroid photographs by 'developing' on-screen.</li>
<li><i><a href="/wiki/The_Colonel%27s_Bequest.html" title="The Colonel's Bequest">The Colonel's Bequest</a></i> (Sierra): <i>Bequest</i> contained riddles and interaction with items and objects like an "ordinary" adventure, but the game focused primarily on communication with other characters and obtaining as much information as possible. The game advanced when the player was present at certain times and places that might reveal information on the plot and backstory. The full score would be attained not for only solving riddles, but for perceiving "suspicious" elements like the relationship between the characters, objects that changed position or traces of information about the killer's identity.</li>
<li><i><a href="/wiki/LOOM.html" title="LOOM">LOOM</a></i> (LucasArts): This game was widely hailed as original and innovative, not only because of the plot, but for the entire concept. Unlike other adventure games, this one did not have an inventory of physical objects and puzzles that relied on combining those objects. Aside from basic movement and object-examining actions, the only interactions the player had with the game world was in casting spells, which was performed by playing musical notes in certain sequences.</li>
<li><i><a href="/wiki/The_Last_Express.html" title="The Last Express">The Last Express</a></i> (Brøderbund): Designed by <a href="/wiki/Jordan_Mechner.html" title="Jordan Mechner">Jordan Mechner</a>, the designer of <a href="/wiki/Prince_of_Persia.html" title="Prince of Persia">Prince of Persia</a>, <i>Express</i> differed from an ordinary adventure game in that it took place in almost complete real-time, meaning that the player had to make split second decisions. In addition, the non-player characters were semi-intelligent, and moved around on their own schedules regardless of the player's progress. The game took place within the crowded confines of the <a href="/wiki/Orient_Express.html" title="Orient Express">Orient Express</a> and featured a few action sequences that did not require much dexterity to complete. As well, the game mostly lacked inventory items and most of the game required you to advance by talking to the other passengers and learn about their backstories, rather than solving traditional puzzles.</li>

<h2>Modern adventure games</h2>
<p>For much of the 1980s, adventure games were one of the most popular types of computer games produced. But in the mid-1990s their market share drastically declined, as action games took a greater share of the market, particularly <a href="/wiki/First_person_shooter.html" title="First person shooter">first person shooters</a> such as <i><a href="/wiki/Doom.html" title="Doom">Doom</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Half-Life.html" title="Half-Life">Half-Life</a></i> that feature strong, story-structured solo games. This slump in popularity led many publishers and developers to see adventure games as financially unfeasible in comparison. Text adventures met the same fate much earlier, but their simplicity has allowed them to thrive as non-commercially developed <a href="/wiki/Interactive_fiction.html" title="Interactive fiction">interactive fiction</a>.</p>
<p>Few recent commercial adventure games have been hits. It has been suggested that this is because the "average" gamer today was weaned on <a href="/wiki/Video_game_console.html" title="Video game console">console</a> <a href="/wiki/Video_game.html" title="Video game">video games</a> and <a href="/wiki/First_person_shooter.html" title="First person shooter">first person shooters</a> rather than the "traditional" computer games cherished by the original crop of adventure gaming enthusiasts. Another explanation offered states that <a href="/wiki/MMORPG.html" title="MMORPG">MMORPGs</a>, which offer a persistent multiplayer world, have at least partially supplanted the genre.</p>
<p>Adventure games have ceased to be the flagship titles they once were, and high profile publishers like <a href="/wiki/Sierra_Entertainment.html" title="Sierra Entertainment">Sierra Entertainment</a> and <a href="/wiki/LucasArts.html" title="LucasArts">LucasArts</a> have either disappeared or shifted towards publishing titles developed by other companies. However, adventure games continue to be made in the 2000s. The games <i><a href="/wiki/Syberia.html" title="Syberia">Syberia</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Syberia_II.html" title="Syberia II">Syberia II</a></i> by <a href="/wiki/Microids.html" title="Microids">Microids</a> garnered high critical acclaim and were published for the <a href="/wiki/Xbox.html" title="Xbox">Xbox</a> gaming console as well as for the PC. The <i>Myst</i> series came to a close in September 2005 with the release of <i><a  title="Myst V: End of Ages">Myst V: End of Ages</a></i> by its original developer, <a href="/wiki/Cyan_Worlds.html" title="Cyan Worlds">Cyan Worlds</a>. Adventure games based on the <a href="/wiki/Nancy_Drew.html" title="Nancy Drew">Nancy Drew</a> books are published by <a href="/wiki/Her_Interactive.html" title="Her Interactive">Her Interactive</a> and comprise a series of over twelve titles published since 2000. The <a href="/wiki/Nintendo_DS.html" title="Nintendo DS">Nintendo DS</a> and its unique features have sparked a renewed interest in pure adventure game content, with the release of <a href="/wiki/Trace_Memory.html" title="Trace Memory">Trace Memory</a> and <a  title="Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney">Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney</a> in 2005 and the announcement of <a  title="Hotel Dusk: Room 215">Hotel Dusk: Room 215</a> in 2006. <a href="/wiki/IGN.html" title="IGN">IGN</a> has noted that Nintendo's <a href="/wiki/Wii.html" title="Wii">Wii</a> controller would be well-suited for the genre, and could see some ground-breaking releases in that vein.</p>
<p>Yet the genre is still easily found at retail and as a result many <a href="/wiki/Fan_%28aficionado%29.html" title="Fan (aficionado)">fans</a> have taken on the challenge of developing their own adventure games. These "<a href="/wiki/Amateur_adventure_games.html" title="Amateur adventure games">amateur adventure games</a>" are in some cases remakes of old classics or sequels to established titles. Such games are either programmed from scratch or composed by using authoring tools. Examples for such graphical development environments for adventure games are <a href="/wiki/Adventure_Game_Studio.html" title="Adventure Game Studio">Adventure Game Studio</a> and <a href="/wiki/Visionaire_%28software%29.html" title="Visionaire (software)">Visionaire</a>.</p>
<p>Although traditional adventure games are rare today, <a href="/wiki/Action-adventure_game.html" title="Action-adventure game">action-adventure games</a> that combine elements of adventure games with action games are quite common. There are also similarities between adventure and <a href="/wiki/Computer_role-playing_game.html" title="Computer role-playing game">role-playing games</a>, particularly those in a more modern, story- and character-based mold. Computer role-playing games in this vein have been published more frequently since the success of <i><a href="/wiki/Baldur%27s_Gate_%28computer_game%29.html" title="Baldur's Gate (computer game)">Baldur's Gate</a></i> in 1998, and console role-playing games have generally been quite focused on plot and story, thanks in part to the success of the <i><a href="/wiki/Final_Fantasy.html" title="Final Fantasy">Final Fantasy</a></i> series. In 2005, <a href="/wiki/Indigo_Prophecy.html" title="Indigo Prophecy">Indigo Prophecy</a> (titled "Fahrenheit" outside of the US and Canada) was released by <a href="/wiki/Quantic_Dream.html" title="Quantic Dream">Quantic Dream</a>. An adventure game with a highly-original interface, many believe that the game will help renew interest in the adventure game genre.</p>
<p>Many famous adventure games have problems running on modern computers. Early adventure games were developed for computers such as the <a href="/wiki/ZX_Spectrum.html" title="ZX Spectrum">ZX Spectrum</a>, the <a href="/wiki/C64.html" title="C64">C64</a> and <a href="/wiki/Amiga.html" title="Amiga">Amiga</a>, which are not in much use today. There are now <a href="/wiki/Emulator.html" title="Emulator">emulators</a> available for personal computers that allow these old games to be played. One <a href="/wiki/Open_Source.html" title="Open Source">Open Source</a> project called <a href="/wiki/ScummVM.html" title="ScummVM">ScummVM</a> provides a free engine for the LucasArts adventure games. Text adventure games have survived much more readily. There are only a small number of widespread standard formats, and nearly all the classics can be played on modern computers. Even some more modern text adventure games can be played on very old computer systems. Text adventure games are also suitable for <a href="/wiki/PDA_%28Computer%29.html" title="PDA (Computer)">PDAs</a>, because they have very small computer system requirements.</p>
<p>There is something of a revival of the adventure game online - in both a fairly traditional style, such as <a href="/wiki/MOTAS.html" title="MOTAS">MOTAS</a>, and in 3-dimensional games, such as <a href="/wiki/Crimson_Room.html" title="Crimson Room">Crimson Room</a>.</p>

<h2>Common features</h2>
<p>Adventure games, like RPGs, often feature "<a href="/wiki/Fetch_quest#Fetch_Quest.html" title="Fetch quest">fetch quests</a>": in order to advance, the player has to help a character in order to gain information or an important item as a reward. In fantasy-themed games, this character is often a healer or magician, and the secondary quest is to find artifacts or items, not uncommonly ingredients for a <a href="/wiki/Potion.html" title="Potion">potion</a>.</p>
<p>Adventure games have been criticized because some games adopt the attitude that 'the ends justify the means'. In such cases, the player must obtain an item from someone reluctant to cooperate, and the only way to progress is to distract him or her in order to steal the item. In contrast, however, many adventure games have quests or missions that urge the player help others; for instance, helping tormented spirits that seek deliverance, freeing a trapped animal, or otherwise performing benevolent, selfless acts. Often these characters will reward the player later in the game, often at a critical juncture.</p>
<p>Early adventure games sometimes trapped the players in <a href="/wiki/Unwinnable.html" title="Unwinnable">unwinnable</a>, <a href="/wiki/Dead_end.html" title="Dead end">dead end</a> situations. For example, if the player overlooked a key (or an important item early in the game), the game cannot be completed if he later finds himself trapped in a cell. Such games frequently did not end at this point since the player was not killed; with no indication that a vital object had been missed, the player was often reduced to trying increasingly outlandish actions until finally restoring to an earlier point or quitting the game altogether. A famous example of a <a href="/wiki/Dead_end.html" title="Dead end">dead end</a> situation is the plant in "<a href="/wiki/Return_to_Zork.html" title="Return to Zork">Return to Zork</a>". Early in the game a plant can be obtained. Most players just take the plant, but will find out later (much later) in the game their plant has died. Without the plant the game can't be finished. What they should have done is carefully dig out the plant, instead of just grabbing it. Naturally, players rarely found this type of gameplay entertaining. Some companies, including LucasArts, deliberately and explicitly avoided dead-end situations in many of their games. Although some adventure purists scorned such practices as "dumbing down games for the masses", more games adopted the approach over time; even Sierra, who was infamous for a time for ruthlessly "punishing the player", eventually embraced the concept.</p>
<p>Some items are featured very often in various adventure games, and have many uses. Two examples are a <a href="/wiki/Rope.html" title="Rope">rope</a> and a <a href="/wiki/Crowbar_%28tool%29.html" title="Crowbar (tool)">crowbar</a>. In some games, certain items are used as part of <a href="/wiki/Running_gag.html" title="Running gag">running gags</a>; for example being used in many absurd situations far from their original intended purpose, or items which are seemingly useless for most of the game, such as the <a href="/wiki/Rubber_chicken.html" title="Rubber chicken">rubber chicken</a> with a <a href="/wiki/Pulley.html" title="Pulley">pulley</a> in the middle in <i>The Secret of Monkey Island</i>.</p>
<p>Many graphic adventure games depicted or make reference to subject matter that would otherwise been <a href="/wiki/Censored.html" title="Censored">censored</a> or <a href="/wiki/Taboo.html" title="Taboo">taboo</a> in a video or computer game. Adventure games set in a gritty environment (i.e. <a href="/wiki/Rise_of_the_Dragon.html" title="Rise of the Dragon">Rise of the Dragon</a>, <a href="/wiki/Police_Quest.html" title="Police Quest">Police Quest</a> and <a href="/wiki/Snatcher.html" title="Snatcher">Snatcher</a>) would contain bits of profanity and include either depictions or allusions to mature sexual themes such as <a href="/wiki/Prostitution.html" title="Prostitution">prostitution</a>, <a href="/wiki/Homosexuality.html" title="Homosexuality">homosexuality</a> and illict drugs. Adventure games that relied heavily on humor (i.e. <a href="/wiki/Discworld.html" title="Discworld">Discworld</a>, <a href="/wiki/Blazing_Dragons.html" title="Blazing Dragons">Blazing Dragons</a>, <a href="/wiki/The_Adventures_of_Willy_Beamish.html" title="The Adventures of Willy Beamish">The Adventures of Willy Beamish</a>, <a href="/wiki/The_Secret_of_Monkey_Island.html" title="The Secret of Monkey Island">The Secret of Monkey Island</a> and <a href="/wiki/Simon_the_Sorcerer.html" title="Simon the Sorcerer">Simon the Sorcerer</a>) were often influenced by <a href="/wiki/Monty_Python.html" title="Monty Python">Monty Python</a>-style satire and comedy.</p>
