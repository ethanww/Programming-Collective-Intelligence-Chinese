<p>In the mid-1980s, stand up comedian, Ron Bennington joined <a href="/wiki/Ron_Diaz.html" title="Ron Diaz">Ron Diaz</a> in creating the hugely popular, raunchy morning radio show "<a href="/wiki/The_Ron_and_Ron_Show.html" title="The Ron and Ron Show">The Ron and Ron Show</a>." The show eventually was syndicated all over the <a href="/wiki/Southeastern_United_States.html" title="Southeastern United States">southeastern United States</a>, and became a launching pad for show regulars like <a href="/wiki/Gary_Spivey.html" title="Gary Spivey">Gary Spivey</a>, The Curtain Boy (comedian <a  class="new" title="Warren Durso">Warren Durso</a>) and <a href="/wiki/Larry_The_Cable_Guy.html" title="Larry The Cable Guy">Larry The Cable Guy</a>. Producer Fez Whatley and regular guests Paul O., Billy the Phone Freak and his fiancé Miss Vicky, Flipper and his musical band the Dead German Tourists, all took advantage of their on-air opportunities and became popular and prominent show personalities.</p>
<p>For a brief period of time, Fez hosted a second show - "Hooters On The Radio" - with Brenda Lee (BL) and Hooters spokesperson (Playboy's Miss July 1986) <a  class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynne_Austin">Lynn Austin</a>. It was during this time that he also developed the very popular "Nature Boy" character, as a tribute to the wrestler <a href="/wiki/Ric_Flair.html" title="Ric Flair">Ric Flair</a>. "The Ron &amp; Ron Radio Network" made national headlines when, during the height of the success of "Miami Vice," Ron and Ron got into a verbal screaming match with actor <a href="/wiki/Don_Johnson.html" title="Don Johnson">Don Johnson</a>. This segment is often repeated and aired on <a href="/wiki/Television.html" title="Television">television</a> biographies on Johnson, to illustrate his lowest point when battling alcohol addiction.

<h3>"Let The Puppies Breathe"</h3>
<p>In the early 1990s, to meet the needs of their fans, the Ron and Ron Show produced CDs and videotapes with show highlights and specially produced material. While their two videos, "Pup Friction" and "Let The Puppies Breathe" included footage from the show and original bits in between segments, much like the popular "<a href="/wiki/Girls_Gone_Wild.html" title="Girls Gone Wild">Girls Gone Wild</a>" video series or <a href="/wiki/Opie_and_Anthony.html" title="Opie and Anthony">Opie and Anthony's</a> "WOW" promotion, both of which they predated, the underlying request behind the phrase "Let the Puppies Breathe" was to encourage women to expose their bare breasts, which was featured on both tapes.</p>

<h3>Florida Appearances</h3>

<ul>
<li><b>Diaz Live From The Riviera Deli</b> (1989)</li>
<li><b>Ybor City</b> (1991)</li>
<li><b>Tampa Convention Center</b> (1992)</li>

</ul>
<p>In addition, in the late 1990s, Ron and Fez hosted one of the country's first adult dodgeball matches in <a href="/wiki/Daytona_Beach.html" title="Daytona Beach">Daytona Beach</a>, Florida.</p>

Several of them had previously been part of <a href="/wiki/Sam_Kinison.html" title="Sam Kinison">Sam Kinison's</a> comedy posse, "Sam Kinison's Outlaws of Comedy", before Kinison was killed in a 1992 car accident.</p>
<p>In addition, Ron managed Ron Bennington's Comedy Scene, a comedy club in <a href="/wiki/Clearwater%2C_Florida.html" title="Clearwater, Florida">Clearwater</a>, Florida, where he is credited by actor and funnyman <a href="/wiki/Jim_Breuer.html" title="Jim Breuer">Jim Breuer</a> for helping discover him. Whenever Ron talks on the radio about these times running a comedy store, they are often shrouded in mystery and intrigue.</p>

Only a few months earlier, on <a href="/wiki/May_22.html" title="May 22">May 22</a>, <a href="/wiki/1998.html" title="1998">1998</a>, <a  class="new" title="The Monsters of the Midday">The Monsters of the Midday</a> (today known as The Monsters of the Morning), gathered together many of the regulars from the cancelled "Ron and Ron Show" in for a reunion: Ron Bennington, Fez Whatley, Billy the Phone Freak, Paul O. and Mitchell Walters. After explaining their side in the split with Diaz, Ron and Fez announced they were getting back into radio. Using the formula they had created in Tampa, they rebuilt the show and recruited new employees, interns and characters. They were on the WKRO for about a year and a half until they were hired by <a href="/wiki/Infinity_Broadcasting.html" title="Infinity Broadcasting">Infinity Broadcasting</a> and moved to New York.</p>

During this time, they reworked and improved their show, and through the help of their popular lead-in ("The Opie and Anthony Show") they discovered a receptive and excited fan base of listeners. Ron and Fez also made a conscious decision at this time to evolve the tone of their new show away from their "shock jock" roots as a way to balance out WNEW's line-up.</p>

<p>When <a href="/wiki/WNEW-FM.html" title="WNEW-FM">WNEW-FM</a> in New York switched to an all-talk format in 1999, after years of being known and respected as a rock station, the "masthead show" became the afternoon drive team of <a href="/wiki/Opie_and_Anthony.html" title="Opie and Anthony">Opie and Anthony</a>. Ron and Fez were signed to host an overnight talk show named "Ron and Fez Dot Com," which started on <a href="/wiki/February_21.html" title="February 21">February 21</a>, <a href="/wiki/2000.html" title="2000">2000</a> and was broadcast from 11 p.m. - 3 a.m.. The show's original premise was two comedians discussing the internet into the wee hours of the morning. Ron and Fez were eventually moved to the early afternoon hours (12:00-3:00 p.m.) and later to the evening hours (7:00-11:00 p.m.), where buoyed by Opie and Anthony's lead-in ratings, Ron and Fez began to enjoy success.</p>
<p>During this period, several memorable characters joined their on-air staff, including their mostly-silent producer Hawk, Tasteless Ginny, and the call-in prankster Joe Poo. The show's web-based premise led to the founding of several sites devoted to the show, including RFBabies.com (once a haven for the show's cadre of young female fans), and the unofficial website for the show <a  class="external text" title="http://www.ronfez.net">ronfez.net</a> . Though the "Dot Com" was dropped from the show's title soon after their debut, Ron and Fez have since inspired an enormous cult-like following on the Internet.</p>

<p><a name="Big_ASS_Cards" id="Big_ASS_Cards"></a></p>
<h3>Big ASS Cards</h3>
<p>Helping to foster the sense of community between themselves and their listeners, Ron and Fez came up with the "Big ASS Card" for any of their fans that wanted to be part of their "All Secret Society". Aside from giving the recipient discounts at sponsors' establishments, the "Big ASS Card" also gave an identity in relation to the show. Every time a Big ASS card holder would call in and give their card number, a recording of <a href="/wiki/Al_Pacino.html" title="Al Pacino">Al Pacino</a> yelling "Hoo-AH!" would be played. Years later, even after they discontinued the promotion, listeners still call in announcing their "B.A.C." number.</p>
<p>In addition to the Big ASS card, there was the "Ron and Fez Restroom Inspection Award" sticker. From a promotional standpoint, there were several problems with the Restroom Inspector stickers, including the correct time slot and not receiving them on time. When they did arrive, Billy Staples and some listeners supposedly put them up around New York. It was a brief promotion started on <a href="/wiki/April_12.html" title="April 12">April 12</a>, <a href="/wiki/2002.html" title="2002">2002</a>. In <a href="/wiki/Hoboken%2C_New_Jersey.html" title="Hoboken, New Jersey">Hoboken</a>, <a href="/wiki/New_Jersey.html" title="New Jersey">New Jersey</a> one of the stickers put on a statue resulted in WNEW having to pay a fine. Unlike the “Big ASS Card,” which continues to be a relevant part of the show 4 years later, the “Restroom Inspection Award” sticker bit played out on two shows and was rarely referenced ever again. It did give Billy Staples the nickname of "MeatFist" because he was blamed for giving out too many.</p>

<h3>September 11th Attacks</h3>

On the evening of September 11, the team stayed on the air taking calls from distressed listeners, some of whom were still unsure whether loved ones were alive inside the <a href="/wiki/World_Trade_Center.html" title="World Trade Center">Twin Towers</a>. Hawk walked across the <a href="/wiki/Queensboro_Bridge.html" title="Queensboro Bridge">Queensboro Bridge</a> against the outpouring hordes of people to get to work. Billy Staples hid in a <a href="/wiki/Long_Island_Rail_Road.html" title="Long Island Rail Road">Long Island Rail Road</a> train bathroom so he could stay in NYC and get to work because only medical and rescue personnel were being allowed into the city. Ron and Fez expressed heartfelt sympathy and related the feelings many New Yorkers wanted to express. Throughout this tough time, Ron and Fez staged several "bar crawls" and other events under the motto <b>"New York Forever"</b>, designed to get their listeners to come into New York and support restaurants and bars in lower Manhattan. One of the more memorable crawls, from the turnout and hilarious drama that followed from it, was the 2001 Halloween Bar Crawl.</p>
<p>Some of the frequented bars included The Slaughtered Lamb and Karavas' Place. Additional public appearances soon followed:</p>

<h3>AFRO Shows</h3>
<p>Ron and Fez shared amicable relationships with all of WNEW's other programs, particularly Opie and Anthony. O&amp;A, as they are often known, would sometimes sit in on the Ron and Fez show, leading to what became known as "AFRO Shows" (AFRO standing for <b>A</b>nthony <b>F</b>ez <b>R</b>on <b>O</b>pie).</p>

<h3>Demise of WNEW</h3>
<p>Ron and Fez's motley cast of characters grew as the show entered 2002; <a href="/wiki/Billy_Staples.html" title="Billy Staples">Billy Staples</a>, their phone screener and producer, became more of an on-air personality, often confronting his problems of substance addiction, and <a href="/wiki/Al_Dukes.html" title="Al Dukes">Al Dukes</a>, their producer, became the butt of many jokes, often ridiculed for his strange habits and perceived managerial ineffectiveness. As the show developed over spring 2002, Ron and Fez began to earn increasingly higher ratings.</p>
<p>After Ron and Fez's increasing popularity throughout the summer of 2002, the <a href="/wiki/Opie_and_Anthony.html" title="Opie and Anthony">Opie and Anthony</a> show was cancelled. After losing what was considered its flagship show, it seemed certain that WNEW would shift from its all-talk format. Still, Ron and Fez remained in their time slot for another five months until WNEW's format "flipped" on <a href="/wiki/January_27.html" title="January 27">January 27</a>, <a href="/wiki/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a> and Ron and Fez moved to sister station <a href="/wiki/WJFK-FM.html" title="WJFK-FM">WJFK-FM</a> in Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>Jeremy Coleman, the <a href="/wiki/Program_director.html" title="Program director">PD</a> from New York's WNEW in 2000, had become aware of Ron and Fez when he was still a program director for WJFK-FM, the sister talk station in Washington D.C. he helped put on the map.

</div>
</div>
<p>After WNEW changed formats in early 2003, Ron and Fez began broadcasting their show on WJFK. Although only heard in Washington DC, Ron and Fez chose to remain in New York until June 2003, when they finally relocated their lives to the Washington D.C. area and their show to the WJFK studios in <a href="/wiki/Fairfax%2C_Virginia.html" title="Fairfax, Virginia">Fairfax, Virginia</a>. Over the course of the next year, several memorable characters, listeners and staff helped give this era its own identity. While the WNEW show had been heavily influenced by a dedicated and funny, core group of callers, WJFK proved to be fertile ground for unique regulars who came on the show. Each brought a different level of compulsion and humor to the show. Perrynoid, Cherrynoid, David Lee Kinison (aka Elfish), Cigar Sid, Bobo Golem and Crazy Jen became call-in and studio regulars.</p>
<p>Known for being team players, Ron and Fez worked on split shifts, did drop-ins for WJFK's <a href="/wiki/Washington_Redskins.html" title="Washington Redskins">Redskins</a> broadcasts, did live commercials and appearances, helped mentor the hosts of a weekend show, <a href="/wiki/The_Hideout.html" title="The Hideout">The Hideout</a>, and developed a positive relationship with Don and Mike, their lead-in show. This, along with improved calls, fresh and funny game shows and bits, a community that needed a good laugh during the <a href="/wiki/2004_presidential_election.html" title="2004 presidential election">2004 presidential election</a> and a sense of momentum propelled Ron and Fez to a stellar ratings book in January 2005.</p>

<h3>The Fastest Hour In Radio</h3>
<p>In mid 2003, after being on WJFK (and Washington) exclusively for just a few months, Ron and Fez agreed to host a one hour mid-day show entitled "The Fastest Hour in Radio", between <a href="/wiki/Howard_Stern.html" title="Howard Stern">Howard Stern</a>, and conservative talker <a href="/wiki/Bill_O%27Reilly_%28commentator%29.html" title="Bill O'Reilly (commentator)">Bill O'Reilly</a>. This timeslot would be in addition to their evening duties, and would not be caller driven. Instead, they relied on themselves, and a brisk and humorous discussion of the day's headlines. When the nighttime show became syndicated in Baltimore, Maryland and Tampa, Florida in the summer of 2004, Ron and Fez went back to concentrating on their evening show, where they hosted the "Fastest Hour" between 7:00-8:00 p.m.</p>

<h3>Politics</h3>
<p>Until 2003, Ron and Fez were not known for their political observations. However, with them moving to the nation's capital, their recent addition of "The Fastest Hour of Radio" to their resume and the <a href="/wiki/2004_Presidential_Election.html" title="2004 Presidential Election">2004 Presidential Election</a>, they began to contribute some of the most interesting political discourse on the radio. Not only did they allow themselves to be passionate, but they encouraged all sides to call and participate.</p>

<h3>DC Area Appearances</h3>
<p>Ron and Fez continued to reach out to their listeners with several local appearances during their time in DC. These included:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Ron and Fez Pool Tournament at</b> (2003) - Included a billiards tournament, Fez performing a karaoke version of "Harper Valley PTA", Cigar Sid performing "Sugar Sugar", J Dubs' "Hot Pepper Challenge" and "Fairyoke" (listeners performing karaoke versions of effeminate songs).</li>

<li><b>Ron and Fez Poker Tournament</b> (2003) - Included a poker tournament, the "Honeymooner Game", the "Gong Show", the "Mating Game", J Dubs' and Crazy Jen's Fire and Ice Challenge", performances by Monty Love, and a very drunk Silera (<a href="/wiki/List_of_Ron_and_Fez_Show_characters.html" title="List of Ron and Fez Show characters">more</a>).</li>
<li><b>Hard Rock Cafe - New York Reunion</b> (2003) - Ron &amp; Fez returned to New York for a Crankcase gig at the Hard Rock Cafe and played to a packed upstairs room. Many of the staff alumni like Hawk, Tasteless Ginny, MikeyD, Tenacious C and Billy Staples came by along with many NY friends of the show (<a href="/wiki/List_of_Ron_and_Fez_Show_characters.html" title="List of Ron and Fez Show characters">more</a>). Anthony Cumia made a surprise appearance and a huge O&amp;A chant erupted, causing WJFK to pull the plug on the show for over an hour, playing a Best-Of and saying that it was because of technical difficulties.</li>
<li><b>The St. Pat's Spat</b> (2004) - included the following boxing matches: Spoon vs. Tommy Bateman, El Jefe vs. J Dubs, and Mikey D vs. Wonderboy where Mikey D quit in the ring.

<p><a name="Stunts_.26_Bets" id="Stunts_.26_Bets"></a></p>
<h3>Stunts &amp; Bets</h3>
<p>For whatever reason, seemingly normal and well-adjusted people are willing to do outrageous things on the Ron and Fez Show. This is something that goes back to their “Ron and Ron” days and their good friend Paul O., and resurfaced with a vengeance when they came on the air in Washington.</p>
<p>During the WJFK years, interns have tackled eating challenges and bets, producers were involved in head-to-head matches with other staff and listeners. There have been also been boxing matches, and some show regulars made wild claims of stunts they knew they could not possibly do.</p>
<p>The old stand-by has been the “Hair Vs. Hair” bet. J. Dubs got to shave El Jefe when he beat him at “The St. Pat’s Spat,” Giant Brian and Benicio shaved Elfish when he lost a bet with Fez on the outcome of the 2004 <a href="/wiki/MLB.html" title="MLB">MLB</a> <a  class="new" title="American League Championship">American League Championship</a> Series, and Fez, when he lost a 2005 summer movie bet to ADF (his nemesis), shaved all of his hair completely off.</p>
<p>In one of the odder show moments, Fez, for no particular reason, seemed to make a bet with himself to go the entire 2004-2005 <a href="/wiki/NFL.html" title="NFL">NFL</a> season without shaving. After the <a href="/wiki/Super_Bowl.html" title="Super Bowl">Super Bowl</a>, in February 2005, Fez spent a week removing his big, gross beard in stages, and having the process documented by an avalanche of photographs taken by remote producer Mikeyboy. Friend of the show, Bobo, collected some of the clippings, and planned to begin working it into a <a href="/wiki/Painting.html" title="Painting">painting</a> of Fez he was planning. Little did anyone know, this new content, which was shared on the web within minutes, would provide so much joy to so many people. These pictures of Fez with big beard, with giant mutton-chops, with a wacky handle-bar mustache and finally clean shaven, became the cornerstone of inspired <a href="/wiki/Photoshop.html" title="Photoshop">Photoshop</a> material (See Photoshop Mike).</p>
<p>Crazy Jen has been at the center of many of these stunts since Ron and Fez arrived at WJFK. Whether it's attempting to drink a gallon of milk in less than an hour, get a date with Fezzie, enduring Chinese water torture, eating hot sauce while sitting in a tub of ice, quarters Super-Glued to her bottom, attempting the world record for most clothespins attached to her face, or trying to eat 50 hard boiled <a href="/wiki/Egg_%28food%29.html" title="Egg (food)">eggs</a> like <a href="/wiki/Paul_Newman.html" title="Paul Newman">Paul Newman</a> did in the movie <a href="/wiki/Cool_Hand_Luke.html" title="Cool Hand Luke">Cool Hand Luke</a>, Jen seemed to enjoy her stunts more if she knew she would fail. In the spring of 2005 Crazy Jen was punished for making a dumb bet about pizza being available at a McDonald's in Times Square and was “banned” from the show for 30 days. Always going with "the bit," her most recent dumb wager with Ron and Fez involved the documentary "Grizzlyman" winning the "Best Picture" <a href="/wiki/Academy_Awards.html" title="Academy Awards">Oscar</a> in 2006, and her bare ass hanging out of a <a href="/wiki/Polar_bear.html" title="Polar bear">polar bear</a> <a href="/wiki/Costume.html" title="Costume">costume</a>.</p>

<p><a name="Parody_Song_Outbreak" id="Parody_Song_Outbreak"></a></p>
<h3>Parody Song Outbreak</h3>
<p>Ron and Fez have been working with this radio staple since their earliest “Ron and Ron” days in Florida. Their original legendary “<a href="/wiki/Parody.html" title="Parody">Parody</a> Guy”, Fast Eddie, is still writing and performing music in Atlanta. At the height of the <i>Ron and Ron</i> show in South Florida, Fast Eddie created hilarious parodies several times a day coinciding with whatever topic or current event the boys were talking about. When they arrived to New York, a number of people made attempts to be go to parody song creator, but it was Perrynoid, out of the Washington D.C. region, who stepped forward with consistently funny and timely observations on the show. This relationship continued when Ron and Fez moved to DC in 2003, with more frequent in-studio appearances, occasionally providing themes to game shows, and sometimes as “The Trubanoid.”</p>
<p>In 2005 Perrynoid had some competition when WJFK listeners Bobo and Tender began dependable and funny contributions of parody songs to the program. Both men had interesting musical backgrounds and stories – Bobo played with many of the Mid-Atlantic regions punk and blues musicians for the better part of 30 years, including <a href="/wiki/Half_Japanese.html" title="Half Japanese">Half Japanese</a>, and Tender was part of the rock combo “The Bouncing Balls,” whose video was one of the earliest played on <a href="/wiki/MTV.html" title="MTV">MTV</a>. (<a href="/wiki/List_of_Ron_and_Fez_Show_characters.html" title="List of Ron and Fez Show characters">more</a>)</p>
<p>Some of Perry’s many stand-out originals include ones he wrote on "Circus Boy," the hysterical "Fat <a href="/wiki/Baby.html" title="Baby">Baby</a>," and his goodbye to “J. Dubs.” Bobo’s prolific songbook, which he performed on a variety of musical instruments, includes "You Can’t Say <a href="/wiki/Taint_%28slang%29.html" title="Taint (slang)">Taint</a> on the Radio," "<a href="/wiki/Pope.html" title="Pope">Pope</a> Bobo, Baby," and the almost controversial "Your Mom's Box.” And Tender’s most notable tunes includes the "Friday Night Lights" theme, "Pee-Shy Fezzie" and "The Call that Melted Fezzie Down," about the on-air meltdown by Fez on his 2005 birthday (see <a href="/wiki/List_of_Ron_and_Fez_Show_characters.html" title="List of Ron and Fez Show characters">Mikey D.</a>).</p>
<p>And while it wasn’t a parody song, Bobo’s 2004 Dave &amp; Busters performance of <a href="/wiki/Nirvana_%28band%29.html" title="Nirvana (band)">Nirvana</a>'s "Smells Like Teen Spirit" on the <a href="/wiki/Sitar.html" title="Sitar">Sitar</a>, featuring intern Chapin on vocals left many people scratching their heads.</p>

<h3>"The Worst Kept Secret In Radio"</h3>
<p>Things began to look bleak for Ron and Fez's future at 106.7 in January 2005 when (after their best ratings book to date at WJFK) the station was forced to absorb the talent from <a href="/wiki/WHFS.html" title="WHFS">WHFS</a> - a "sister station" that switched formats from modern rock to Spanish dance. Ironically, this talent included <a href="/wiki/The_Sports_Junkies.html" title="The Sports Junkies">The Sports Junkies</a>, who were given the midday spot many had hoped would go to Ron and Fez. The first station casualty, however, was "<a href="/wiki/The_Hideout.html" title="The Hideout">The Hideout</a>" who lost their late night shift, and eventually relocated to Florida (WTKS 104.1,current home to former Ron and Fez intern Tuddle). With nowhere to advance in the station line up, and with a seeming lack of respect shown the show by frequent pre-emptions for infomercials on <a href="/wiki/University_of_Maryland_Terrapins.html" title="University of Maryland Terrapins">University of Maryland Terrapins</a> basketball ("Man on Man") and "Redskins Radio" Monday nights, the hosts had no choice but to entertain the Internet rumors that they would leave terrestrial radio and join their <a href="/wiki/WNEW-FM.html" title="WNEW-FM">WNEW-FM</a> friends, <a href="/wiki/Opie_and_Anthony.html" title="Opie and Anthony">Opie and Anthony</a>, on XM satellite radio. Much of 2005 was filled with speculation and hints, but nothing was confirmed until the last segment, of their last night on the air in Washington D.C. - Friday, <a href="/wiki/July_29.html" title="July 29">July 29</a>, <a href="/wiki/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>.</p>

<p>On August 1, 2005, three days after Ron and Fez signed off from <a href="/wiki/WJFK.html" title="WJFK">WJFK</a>, the official announcement was finally made that they would be going to <a href="/wiki/XM_Satellite_Radio.html" title="XM Satellite Radio">XM Satellite Radio</a> beginning September 12 <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/07/30/AR2005073001213.html?sub=AR">[2]</a> <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.xmradio.com/newsroom/screen/pr_2005_08_01.html">[3]</a>.

<h2>Comedy</h2>
<p>Ron and Fez are seasoned comedians who can make being funny and interesting on the radio sound easy. While they seldom rely on old material for laughs, they do know that several of the characters, bits and catchphrases that have developed over the years have become popular with their listeners, and weave and repurpose them into the show when appropriate. Many of the show's characters were voiced by Ron; during some of the interviews Ron would convienently stop talking as a slew of characters would harass the person being interviewed.</p>

<li><b>Jan Brady</b> - The middle daughter of Mike and Carol Brady, there is rarely a topic that is brought up on The Ron and Fez Show that can't be related to Jan's own sad life as a member of "<a href="/wiki/The_Brady_Bunch.html" title="The Brady Bunch">The Brady Bunch</a>."

Long time member of the Ron and Fez Show, you never know when Iris will "call" in with her perspective of current events, or her impression of the show, or its guests.

<h3>Music</h3>
<p>Ron and Fez are also known for the eclectic music they use as part of their show opening, closing or the various beds they use coming in and out of commercial breaks. Previous incarnations of "The Ron and Fez Show" have used many different styles of opening.</p>
<p>Their current opening theme is <b>"Launchpad"</b> by <a href="/wiki/Particle_%28band%29.html" title="Particle (band)">Particle</a>, combined with various sound bites or "drops", such as <a href="/wiki/Samuel_L._Jackson.html" title="Samuel L. Jackson">Samuel L. Jackson</a>'s bible-quoting from <a href="/wiki/Pulp_Fiction_%28film%29.html" title="Pulp Fiction (film)">Pulp Fiction</a>. For many years their closing song has been <b>"Vertigogo" by <a href="/wiki/Combustible_Edison.html" title="Combustible Edison">Combustible Edison</a></b>, featured in the movie <a href="/wiki/Four_Rooms.html" title="Four Rooms">Four Rooms</a>. During their WNEW days, the opening music bed was <b>"Fired"</b> by <a href="/wiki/Ben_Folds.html" title="Ben Folds">Ben Folds</a>.</p>
<p><b>The opening and closing theme music in 2005</b> received a lot of attention from listeners who were familiar with the speculation that Ron and Fez might be leaving WJFK at some point and heading to satellite radio. Some of this, like the opening choice in January 2005 of the J. Geils Band "Crusin For A Love" (with its lyric "I'm back on Broadway") turned out to be merely prophetic - listeners in late 2004 knew that Ron had a rediscovery of the <a href="/wiki/J._Geils_Band.html" title="J. Geils Band">J. Geils Band</a>, and that the song and the band was back into rotation months before any legitimate thought of leaving Washington D.C. began. However, when they switched out their closing song for versions of "I Shall Be Released" at the beginning of the summer of '05, it was a clear sign that they were hoping to be out of their contract, which they admitted on their final WJFK show. Also on that final D.C. broadcast: "We Want The Airwaves," "Please Don't Talk About Me When I'm Gone," "Radio, Radio," "So Long Baby Goodbye," and "Satellite of Love," which was their last song played on terrestrial radio.</p>
