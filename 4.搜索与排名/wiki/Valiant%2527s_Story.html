<h2>The Fall of Thule - Dream of Camelot - Valiant's Journey</h2>
<p>Prince of Thule {later Knight of the Round Table}, son of King Willem and Queen Briana. After the kingdom of Thule fell into the hands of a War Lord Cynin, Valiant and his family were sent across the sea, and forced to live in a marsh in exile. The life that Valiant and his family were now forced to live, angered the young prince, and revenge began to burn in his heart. Rolf, weapon master to King Willem, reminded Valiant that there was more to being a prince then living in a castle, and holding a title. Valiant, seeing the truth in Rolf's words, began to try to make the best of life in the marsh. When Valiant had a vision, bidding him to seek Camelot, he knew destiny was at work. Willem, believing his son to have given himself to a fool's quest, refused Valiant of his blessing. Valiant bid his mother goodbye, and set off to find his dream. Valiant had believed he would reach Camelot quickly, but he was soon to learn that his journey would be a long one. Three days into his journey, Valiant met a young peasant Arn, who gladly shared his supper with the hungry prince. Valiant was able to return the favor by slaying a serpent, about to attack the peasant. Valiant and Arn became fast friends, when a marsh monster decided to have them as an afternoon meal, Valiant used one of Arn's fishing nets, and Arn throw a well aimed spear, forever freeing the swamp, from the menace of such a beast. Valiant wanting to be on with his quest, bid Arn farewell, and went off through a dense part of the swamp.</p>
<p>Valiant soon found himself face to face with a fearsome wild-man, using vines to trip the barbarian, Valiant took up the wild-man's club, beating him till he fell. Valiant was surprised when Arn came running up to him, the peasant had followed Valiant, as he worried what the prince may find in the vile swamp. Valiant was grateful to have Arn with him, but the realization that he had all but taken the life of the barbarian deeply troubled the young prince. Valiant and Arn made camp, and cared for the wild-man, who longed for his home. Having lost his own homeland Valiant decided that he and Arn, would return the wild-man to his place of longing. The journey to the wild-man's home was difficult, but the two young men pressed on, knowing that they would bring peace to the barbarian. When Valiant and Arn reached the wild-man's home, they were met by screams from a hooded woman, the barbarian's mother. Thinking the Valiant and Arn had wished her son harm, the witch spun a web of unbreakable binds. When Valiant tried to explain that he was seeking Camelot, the witch forced him to drink of some herbal potion, telling him he would see Camelot. The witch's brew gave Valiant a nightmare, showing him the death of King Arthur, and the fall of Camelot itself. When Valiant awoke, the witch freed him and Arn, spearing their lives from not leaving her son to die, but told Valiant the nightmare she had shown to him, would forever stand to haunt him. Valiant found new strength from the dreaded vision, believing he could keep Camelot from meeting such a fate. Valiant asked Arn to join him in his quest for knighthood, and two friends set forth again to find Camelot.</p>
<p>Valiant, and Arn's path led them to the Village of Bridgesford, where they erned the enemity of the Baron Duncan Draconaris, and his brother, the shariff of Bridgesford. The shairff, Robert was trying to abduct the daughter of a blacksmith, Rowanne, but Valiant and Arn put an end to his plans, shaming him in front of the whole village. Cedric the blacksmith welcomed Valiant and Arn into his home, and Valiant shared the story of his quest for Camelot. When word spread to Baron Duncan Draconaris, that Valiant was in search of Camelot he was driven to anger. Knowing Camelot was real, but not wanting it's ideals to enter his shire, the Baron set off to have Valiant and Arn excuted. With the help of Cedirc the blacksmith, his wife Elizabeth, and Rowanne, Valiant and Arn escaped the forces of the Baron, but at the cost of a bounty being put on Rowanne's head. It was then clear that Rowanne would join Valiant and Arn in their quest for Camelot.</p>
<p>The three young heroes believed themselves safe, after leaving Bridgesford, but soon learned quite differently. While Arn showed Valiant the use of a quarterstaff, Rowanne was kidnapped by a self proclaimed Bouny Hunter. Valiant and Arn had to use all their skill and wits, to track down Rowanne. Ever the cleaver thinker, Valiant came up with a plan to cross a river by tying rope from one end of the river side to the other, then steading themseleves with rocks, hanging from their belts, Valiant and Arn bested the river, and went forward to seek Rowanne. Finding Rowanne safe in the old ruines of a Castle Keep, the questers made the old fortress their home, while they searched on for Camelot.</p>
<p>Valiant by chance, or by some greater unseen hand, found a cave and there met a Viking, Thor,who had long ago set off on his own quest for Camelot. At first Thor appeared to be a mad man putting Valiant in a pit, and sending a hungry bear in after him. Through cleverness Valiant was able to escape from the pit into Thor's cave sleeping chamber. It was there that, Valiant discovered Thor's story upon a wall in the chamber. It seemed Thor had been given charge by King Olaf of the Vikings, to seek Camelot, and deliver his royal ring to King Arthur, as a sign of peace. However Thor and his men had been betrayed, and Thor witnessed the slaying of his country men, at the hands of a Knight of the Round Table. Valiant then realized that Thor was not indeed a man over come by madness, but a loyal servant who had not been able to fulfill his quest. As Thor died in the arms of Valiant and Arn, he entrusted to them his quest, it was now up to Valiant to see that Olaf's ring was given to King Arthur. MORE TO COME</p>
