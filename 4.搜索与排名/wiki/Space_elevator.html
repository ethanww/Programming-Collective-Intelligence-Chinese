<p>A <b>space elevator</b> is a theoretical <a href="/wiki/Structure.html" title="Structure">structure</a> designed to transport <a href="/wiki/Material.html" title="Material">material</a> from a <a href="/wiki/Planet.html" title="Planet">planet</a>'s <a href="/wiki/Surface.html" title="Surface">surface</a> into <a href="/wiki/Outer_space.html" title="Outer space">space</a>. Many different types of <a href="/wiki/Space.html" title="Space">space</a> <a href="/wiki/Elevator.html" title="Elevator">elevators</a> have been proposed. They all share the goal of replacing <a href="/wiki/Rocket_propulsion.html" title="Rocket propulsion">rocket propulsion</a> with the traversal of a fixed structure via a mechanism not unlike an <a href="/wiki/Elevator.html" title="Elevator">elevator</a> in order to move <a href="/wiki/Material.html" title="Material">material</a> into or beyond <a href="/wiki/Planetary_orbit.html" title="Planetary orbit">orbit</a>. Space <a href="/wiki/Elevators.html" title="Elevators">elevators</a> have also sometimes been referred to as <b>beanstalks</b>, <b>space bridges</b>, <b>space lifts</b>, <b>space ladders</b> or <b>orbital towers</b>.</p>
<p>The most common proposal is a <a href="/wiki/Tether.html" title="Tether">tether</a>, usually in the form of a <a href="/wiki/Cable.html" title="Cable">cable</a> or <a href="/wiki/Ribbon.html" title="Ribbon">ribbon</a>, spanning from the surface to a point beyond <a href="/wiki/Geosynchronous_orbit.html" title="Geosynchronous orbit">geosynchronous orbit</a>. As the planet rotates, the inertia at the end of the tether counteracts gravity and keeps the cable taut via <a href="/wiki/Centrifugal_force.html" title="Centrifugal force">centrifugal force</a>. Vehicles can then climb the tether and escape the planet's <a href="/wiki/Gravity.html" title="Gravity">gravity</a> without the use of rocket propulsion. Such a structure could eventually permit delivery of great quantities of <a href="/wiki/Cargo.html" title="Cargo">cargo</a> and <a href="/wiki/Passenger.html" title="Passenger">people</a> to orbit, and at costs only a fraction of those associated with current means.</p>

<h2>Non-tether space elevator concepts</h2>
<p>At this time orbital tethers are the only space elevator concept that is the subject of active research and <a href="/wiki/Commercialization_of_space.html" title="Commercialization of space">commercial interest in space</a>. However, there are two related concepts worth mentioning: a <i><a href="/wiki/Space_fountain.html" title="Space fountain">space fountain</a></i> and a very tall <i>compressive structure</i> (i.e. a structure that stands on its own).</p>
<p>A space fountain would use pellets fired up from the ground by a <a href="/wiki/Mass_driver.html" title="Mass driver">mass driver</a>, the pellets traveling through the center of a tower. These pellets would impart their kinetic energy to the tower structure via electromagnetic drag as they traveled up and again as their direction was reversed by a magnetic field at the top. Thus the structure would not be supported by the compressive strength of its materials, and could be hundreds of kilometers high. Unlike tethered space elevators (which have to be placed near the equator), a space fountain could be located at any <a href="/wiki/Latitude.html" title="Latitude">latitude</a>. Space fountains would require a continuous supply of power to remain aloft.</p>
<p>Compressive structures would be similar to those used for aerial masts. While these structures might reach the agreed <a href="/wiki/Karman_line.html" title="Karman line">altitude for space</a> (100&#160;km), they are unlikely to reach <a href="/wiki/Geostationary_orbit.html" title="Geostationary orbit">geostationary orbit</a> (35,786&#160;km). Due to the <a href="/wiki/Difference_between_sub-orbital_and_orbital_spaceflights.html" title="Difference between sub-orbital and orbital spaceflights">difference between sub-orbital and orbital spaceflights</a>, additional rockets or other means of propulsion would be necessary to achieve orbital speed.</p>

<h2>Orbital tethers</h2>
<p>This concept, also called an <b>orbital space elevator</b>, <b>geosynchronous orbital <a href="/wiki/Tether_propulsion.html" title="Tether propulsion">tether</a></b>, or a <b>beanstalk</b>, is a subset of the <a href="/wiki/Skyhook_%28structure%29.html" title="Skyhook (structure)">skyhook</a> concept. Construction would be a vast project: a tether would have to be built of a <a href="/wiki/Material.html" title="Material">material</a> that could endure tremendous <a href="/wiki/Stress_%28physics%29.html" title="Stress (physics)">stress</a> while also being light-weight, cost-effective, and manufacturable in great quantities. Today's materials <a href="/wiki/Technology.html" title="Technology">technology</a> does not quite meet these requirements, although <a href="/wiki/Carbon_nanotube.html" title="Carbon nanotube">carbon nanotube</a> technology shows promise. A considerable number of other novel engineering problems would also have to be solved to make a space elevator practical. Not all problems regarding feasibility have yet been addressed. Nevertheless, some believe that the necessary technology might be developed as early as 2008<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a  title="">[1]</a></sup> and the first space elevator could be operational by 2018.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a  title="">[2]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a  title="">[3]</a></sup></p>

One concept for the space elevator has it tethered to a mobile seagoing platform.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>There are a variety of tether designs. Almost every design includes a base station, a cable, climbers, and a counterweight.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Base station">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Base_station" id="Base_station"></a></p>
<h3>Base station</h3>
<p>The base station designs typically fall into two categories—mobile and stationary. Mobile stations are typically large oceangoing vessels, though airborne stations have been proposed as well. Stationary platforms are generally located in high-altitude locations, such as on top of high towers.</p>
<p>Mobile platforms have the advantage of being able to maneuver to avoid high winds, storms, and space debris. While stationary platforms don't have these advantages, they typically have access to cheaper and more reliable power sources, and require a shorter cable. While the decrease in cable length may seem minimal (typically no more than a few kilometers), that can significantly reduce the minimal width of the cable at the center, and reduce the minimal length of cable reaching beyond geostationary orbit significantly.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Cable">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Cable" id="Cable"></a></p>
<h3>Cable</h3>
<p>The cable must be made of a material with an extremely high <a href="/wiki/Tensile_strength.html" title="Tensile strength">tensile strength</a>/density ratio (the stress a material can be subjected to without breaking, divided by its density). A space elevator can be made relatively economically feasible if a cable with a density similar to <a href="/wiki/Graphite.html" title="Graphite">graphite</a> and a tensile strength of ~65–120 <a href="/wiki/Gigapascal.html" title="Gigapascal">GPa</a> can be produced in bulk at a reasonable price.</p>
<p>By comparison, most steel has a tensile strength of under 2 GPa, and the strongest steels no more than 5.5 GPa, but steel is dense. The much lighter material <a href="/wiki/Kevlar.html" title="Kevlar">Kevlar</a> has a tensile strength of 2.6–4.1 GPa, while <a href="/wiki/Quartz.html" title="Quartz">quartz</a> fiber can reach upwards of 20 GPa; the tensile strength of <a href="/wiki/Diamond.html" title="Diamond">diamond</a> filaments would theoretically be minimally higher.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Carbon_nanotube.html" title="Carbon nanotube">Carbon nanotubes</a> appear to have a theoretical tensile strength and density that is well above the desired minimum for space elevator structures. The technology to manufacture bulk quantities<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a  title="">[4]</a></sup> of this material and fabricate them into a cable is in early stages of development. While theoretically carbon nanotubes can have tensile strengths beyond 120 GPa, in practice the highest tensile strength ever observed in a single-walled tube is 52 GPa, and such tubes averaged breaking between 30 and 50 GPa. <sup id="_ref-Yu_2000_PRL_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[5]</a></sup> Even the strongest fiber made of nanotubes is likely to have notably less strength than its components. Improving tensile strength depends on further research on purity and different types of nanotubes.</p>
<div class="thumb tright">

A seagoing anchor station would incidentally act as a deep-water <a href="/wiki/Seaport.html" title="Seaport">seaport</a>.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Most designs call for single-walled carbon nanotubes. While multi-walled nanotubes may attain higher tensile strengths, they have disproportionately higher mass and are consequently poor choices for building the cable. One potential material possibility is to take advantage of the high pressure interlinking properties of carbon nanotubes of a single variety.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a  title="">[6]</a></sup> While this would cause the tubes to lose some tensile strength by the trading of <a href="/wiki/Sp%C2%B2_bond.html" title="Sp² bond">sp² bond</a> (graphite, nanotubes) for <a  class="new" title="Sp³ bond">sp³</a> (diamond), it will enable them to be held together in a single fiber by more than the usual, weak <a href="/wiki/Van_der_Waals_force.html" title="Van der Waals force">Van der Waals force</a> (VdW), and allow manufacturing of a fiber of any length.</p>
<p>The technology to spin regular VdW-bonded yarn from carbon nanotubes is just in its infancy: the first success to spin a long yarn as opposed to pieces of only a few centimeters has been reported only very recently (March 2004); but the strength/weight ratio was not as good as Kevlar due to the inconsistent quality and short length of the tubes being held together by VdW.</p>
<p>Note that <a href="/wiki/As_of_2006.html" title="As of 2006">as of 2006</a>, carbon nanotubes have an approximate price of $25/gram, and 20,000 kg - twenty million times that much - would be necessary to form even a seed elevator. This price is decreasing rapidly, and large-scale production would reduce it further, but the price of suitable carbon nanotube cable is anyone's guess at this time.</p>
<p>Carbon nanotube fiber is an area of energetic worldwide research because the applications go much further than space elevators. Other suggested application areas include suspension bridges, new composite materials, lighter aircraft and rockets, computer processor interconnects, and so on. This is good for space elevators because it is likely to push down the price of the cable material further.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Cable taper">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Cable_taper" id="Cable_taper"></a></p>
<h4>Cable taper</h4>
<p>Due to its enormous length a space elevator cable must be carefully designed to carry its own weight as well as the smaller weight of climbers. The required strength of the cable will vary along its length, since at various points it has to carry the weight of the cable below, or provide a <a href="/wiki/Centripetal_force.html" title="Centripetal force">centripetal force</a> to retain the cable and counterweight above. In an ideal cable, the actual strength of the cable at any given point would be no greater than the required strength at that point (plus a safety margin). This implies a tapered design.</p>
<p>Using a model that takes into account the Earth's gravitational and "centrifugal" forces (and neglecting the smaller solar and lunar effects), it is possible to show<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a  title="">[7]</a></sup> that the cross-sectional area of the cable as a function of height is given by:</p>

<p>Using the density and tensile strength of steel, and assuming a diameter of 1&#160;cm at ground level yields a diameter of several hundred kilometers (!) at geostationary orbit height, showing that steel, and indeed most materials used in present day engineering, are unsuitable for building a space elevator.</p>
<p>The equation shows us that there are four ways of achieving a more reasonable thickness at geostationary orbit:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using a lower density material. Not much scope for improvement as the range of densities of most solids that come into question is rather narrow, somewhere between 1000&#160;kg·m<sup>-3</sup> and 5000&#160;kg·m<sup>-3</sup>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Using a higher strength material. This is the area where most of the research is focused. Carbon nanotubes are tens of times stronger than the strongest types of steel, hugely reducing the cable's cross-sectional area at geostationary orbit.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Increasing the height of a tip of the base station, where the base of cable is attached. The exponential relationship means a small increase in base height results in a large decrease in thickness at geostationary level. Towers of up to 100&#160;km high have been proposed. Not only would a tower of such height reduce the cable mass, it would also avoid exposure of the cable to atmospheric processes.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Making the cable as thin as possible at its base. It still has to be thick enough to carry a payload however, so the minimum thickness at base level also depends on tensile strength. A cable made of carbon nanotubes (a type of <a href="/wiki/Fullerene.html" title="Fullerene">fullerene</a>), would typically be just a millimeter wide at the base.</li>

Most space elevator designs call for a <b>climber</b> to move autonomously along a stationary cable.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>A space elevator cannot be an elevator in the typical sense (with moving cables) due to the need for the cable to be significantly wider at the center than the tips. While designs employing smaller, segmented moving cables along the length of the main cable have been proposed, most cable designs call for the "elevator" to climb up a stationary cable.</p>
<p>Climbers cover a wide range of designs. On elevator designs whose cables are planar ribbons, some have proposed to use pairs of rollers to hold the cable with friction. Other climber designs involve moving arms containing pads of hooks, rollers with retracting hooks, magnetic levitation (unlikely due to the bulky track required on the cable), and numerous other possibilities.</p>
<p>Power is a significant obstacle for climbers. Energy storage densities, barring significant advances in compact nuclear power, are unlikely to ever be able to store the energy for an entire climb in a single climber without making it weigh too much. Some potential solutions have involved <a href="/wiki/Laser.html" title="Laser">laser</a> or <a href="/wiki/Microwave.html" title="Microwave">microwave</a> <a href="/wiki/Power_beaming.html" title="Power beaming">power beaming</a>, and solar power. Other possible designs involve the use of:</p>
<ul>
<li>energy from regenerative braking of down-climbers passing energy to up-climbers as they pass, <sup title="The text in the vicinity of this tag needs citation." class="noprint">[<a  title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><i>citation&#160;needed</i></a>]</sup></li>
<li>magnetospheric braking of the cable to dampen oscillations, <sup title="The text in the vicinity of this tag needs citation." class="noprint">[<a  title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><i>citation&#160;needed</i></a>]</sup></li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Troposphere.html" title="Troposphere">tropospheric</a> heat differentials in the cable, <sup title="The text in the vicinity of this tag needs citation." class="noprint">[<a  title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><i>citation&#160;needed</i></a>]</sup></li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Ionosphere.html" title="Ionosphere">ionospheric</a> discharge through the cable. <sup title="The text in the vicinity of this tag needs citation." class="noprint">[<a  title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><i>citation&#160;needed</i></a>]</sup></li>
</ul>
<p>The primary power methods (laser and microwave power beaming) have significant problems with both efficiency and heat dissipation on both sides, although with optimistic numbers for future technologies, they are feasible. Using electrical power transmitted from earth (or from the geostationary station) through the tether cable would require the use of yet to be developed superconducting materials on the surface of the cable, and would add potential corrosion and microscopic cracking issues.</p>
<p>Climbers must be paced at optimal timings so as to minimize cable stress and oscillations and to maximize throughput. The weakest point of the cable is near its planetary connection; new climbers can typically be launched so long as there are not multiple climbers in this area at once. An only-up elevator can handle a higher throughput, but has the disadvantage of not allowing energy recapture through regenerative down-climbers. Additionally, an up-only elevator would require some other method to return people to Earth. Finally, only-up climbers that don't return to earth must be disposable; if used, they should be modular so that their components can be used for other purposes in space. In any case, smaller climbers have the advantage over larger climbers of giving better options for how to pace trips up the cable, but may impose technological limitations.</p>

<p><a name="Counterweight" id="Counterweight"></a></p>
<h3>Counterweight</h3>
<p>There have been two dominant methods proposed for dealing with the counterweight need: a heavy object, such as a captured asteroid or a <a href="/wiki/Space_station.html" title="Space station">space station</a>, positioned past geosynchronous orbit, or extending the cable itself well past geosynchronous orbit. The latter idea has gained more support in recent years due to the relative simplicity of the task and the fact that a payload that went to the end of the counterweight-cable would acquire considerable velocity relative to the Earth, allowing it to be launched into interplanetary space.</p>

As the car climbs the elevator takes on a 1 degree lean, due to the top of the elevator traveling faster than the bottom around the Earth (Coriolis effect). This diagram is not to scale.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The horizontal speed of each part of the cable increases with altitude, proportional to distance from the center of the Earth, reaching <a href="/wiki/Orbital_velocity.html" title="Orbital velocity">orbital velocity</a> at geosynchronous orbit. Therefore as a payload is lifted up a space elevator, it needs to gain not only altitude but <a href="/wiki/Angular_momentum.html" title="Angular momentum">angular momentum</a> (horizontal speed) as well.</p>
<p>This angular momentum is taken from the Earth's own rotation. As the climber ascends it is initially moving slightly more slowly than the cable that it moves onto (<a href="/wiki/Coriolis_effect.html" title="Coriolis effect">Coriolis effect</a>) and thus the climber "drags" on the cable, carrying the cable with it very slightly to the west (and necessarily pulling the counterweight slightly to the west, shown as an offset of the counterweight in the diagram to right, slightly changing the motion of the counterweight). At a 200 km/h climb speed (if the relative mass of the elevator and cable have certain values) it can be shown that this generates a 1 degree lean on the lower portion of the cable. The horizontal component of the tension in the non-vertical cable applies a sideways pull on the payload, accelerating it eastward (see diagram) and this is the source of the speed that the climber needs. Conversely, the cable pulls westward on Earth's surface, insignificantly slowing the Earth, from Newton's 3rd law.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the overall effect of the centrifugal force acting on the cable causes it to constantly try to return to the energetically favourable vertical orientation, so after an object has been lifted on the cable the counterweight will swing back towards the vertical like an inverted pendulum. Provided that the Space Elevator is designed so that the center of mass always stays above geosynchronous orbit<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a  title="">[8]</a></sup> for the maximum climb speed of the climbers, the elevator cannot fall over. Lift and descent operations must be carefully planned so as to keep the pendulum-like motion of the counterweight around the tether point under control.</p>
<p>By the time the payload has reached GEO the angular momentum (horizontal speed) is enough that the payload is in orbit.</p>
<p>The opposite process would occur for payloads descending the elevator, tilting the cable eastwards and insignificantly increasing Earth's rotation speed.</p>

<p>We can determine the velocities that might be attained at the end of <a  title="">Pearson's 144,000 km tower (or cable)</a>. At the end of the tower, the tangential velocity is 10.93 kilometers per second which is more than enough to <a href="/wiki/Escape_velocity.html" title="Escape velocity">escape</a> Earth's gravitational field and send probes as far out as <a href="/wiki/Saturn_%28planet%29.html" title="Saturn (planet)">Saturn</a>. If an object were allowed to slide freely along the upper part of the tower, a velocity high enough to escape the <a href="/wiki/Solar_system.html" title="Solar system">solar system</a> entirely would be attained. This is accomplished by trading off overall angular momentum of the tower for velocity of the launched object, in much the same way one snaps a towel or throws a <a href="/wiki/Lacrosse.html" title="Lacrosse">lacrosse</a> ball. After such an operation a cable would be left with less angular momentum than required to keep its geostationary position. The rotation of the Earth would then pull on the cable increasing its angular velocity, leaving the cable swinging backwards and forwards about its starting point.</p>
<p>For higher velocities, the cargo can be electromagnetically accelerated, or the cable could be extended, although that would require additional strength in the cable.</p>

<h3>Extraterrestrial elevators</h3>
<p>A space elevator could also be constructed on some of the other planets, asteroids and moons.</p>
<p>A <a href="/wiki/Mars.html" title="Mars">Martian</a> tether could be much shorter than one on Earth. Mars' surface <a href="/wiki/Gravity.html" title="Gravity">gravity</a> is 38% of Earth's, while it rotates around its axis in about the same time as Earth. Because of this, Martian <a href="/wiki/Areostationary_orbit.html" title="Areostationary orbit">areostationary orbit</a> is much closer to the surface, and hence the elevator would be much shorter. Exotic materials might not be required to construct such an elevator. However, building a Martian elevator would be a unique challenge because the Martian moon <a href="/wiki/Phobos_%28moon%29.html" title="Phobos (moon)">Phobos</a> is in a low orbit, and intersects the equator regularly (twice every orbital period of 11 h 6 min). A collision between the elevator and the 22.2 km diameter moon would have to be avoided through active steering of the elevator, or perhaps by moving the moon itself out of the area. One simpler way to resolve the problem of Phobos (1.1 degree orbital inclination) or <a href="/wiki/Deimos_%28moon%29.html" title="Deimos (moon)">Deimos</a> (1.8 degree orbital inclination) interaction is to position the tether anchor perhaps five (5) degrees off the Martian equator. There would be a small payload penalty, but the tether would pass outside the orbital inclination of the two moons. Also, the tether would depart the Martian anchor at 5-10 degrees from vertical.</p>
<p>Conversely, a <a href="/wiki/Venus.html" title="Venus">Venusian</a> space elevator would need to be much longer. Although a tether placed at the stationary orbit of the slowly rotating Venus would intersect the sun, one could be constructed that rotated with the fast-moving cloud decks of the planet which take only four earth days to make a complete cycle. The cable would need to exceed 100 thousand kilometers long but, counter-intuitively, would experience less stress due to the slightly smaller gravity exerted on the cable. Such an elevator could service <a href="/wiki/Aerostat.html" title="Aerostat">aerostats</a> or <a href="/wiki/Floating_cities_%28science_fiction%29.html" title="Floating cities (science fiction)">floating cities</a> in the benign regions of the atmosphere.</p>
<p>A <a href="/wiki/Lunar_space_elevator.html" title="Lunar space elevator">lunar space elevator</a> would need to be very long—more than twice the length of an Earth elevator, but due to the low gravity of the moon, can be made of existing engineering materials. Alternatively, due to the lack of atmosphere on the Moon, a rotating <a href="/wiki/Tether.html" title="Tether">tether</a> could be used with its center of mass in orbit around the Moon with a <a href="/wiki/Counterweight.html" title="Counterweight">counterweight</a> (i.e. a <a href="/wiki/Space_station.html" title="Space station">space station</a>) at the short end and a <a href="/wiki/Payload.html" title="Payload">payload</a> at the long end. The path of the payload would be an <a href="/wiki/Epicycloid.html" title="Epicycloid">epicycloid</a> around the Moon, touching down at some integer number of times per orbit. Thus, payloads are lifted off the surface of the Moon, and flung away at the high point of the orbit.</p>
<p>Rapidly spinning asteroids or moons could use cables to eject materials in order to move the materials to convenient points, such as Earth orbits; or conversely, to eject materials in order to send the bulk of the mass of the asteroid or moon to Earth orbit or a <a href="/wiki/Lagrangian_point.html" title="Lagrangian point">Lagrangian point</a>. This was suggested by <a href="/wiki/Russell_Johnston.html" title="Russell Johnston">Russell Johnston</a> in the 1980s. <a href="/wiki/Freeman_Dyson.html" title="Freeman Dyson">Freeman Dyson</a>, a physicist and mathematician, has suggested using such smaller systems as power generators at points distant from the Sun where solar power is uneconomical.</p>
<p>It may also be possible to construct space elevators at the three smaller <a href="/wiki/Gas_giant.html" title="Gas giant">gas giants</a>, <a href="/wiki/Saturn.html" title="Saturn">Saturn</a>, <a href="/wiki/Uranus.html" title="Uranus">Uranus</a> and <a href="/wiki/Neptune.html" title="Neptune">Neptune</a>.

These outer space elevators could facilitate the exchange of supplies and <a href="/wiki/Helium-3.html" title="Helium-3">helium-3</a> between floating mining colonies in the atmospheres and local moon settlements. However, difficulties such as the equatorially orbiting lower rings and moons of these giant planets would first need to be overcome.</p>

<p>Two different ways to deploy a space elevator have been proposed.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Traditional way">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Traditional_way" id="Traditional_way"></a></p>
<h3>Traditional way</h3>
<p>One early plan involved lifting the entire mass of the elevator into geosynchronous orbit, and simultaneously lowering one cable downwards towards the Earth's surface while another cable is deployed upwards directly away from the Earth's surface.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Tidal_force.html" title="Tidal force">Tidal forces</a> (<a href="/wiki/Gravitational_force.html" title="Gravitational force">gravity</a> and <a href="/wiki/Centrifugal_force.html" title="Centrifugal force">centrifugal force</a>) would naturally pull the cables directly towards and directly away from the Earth and keep the elevator balanced around geosynchronous orbit. As the cable is deployed, coriolis forces would pull the upper portion of the cable somewhat to the West and the lower portion of the cable somewhat to the East, this effect can be controlled by varying the deployment speed.</p>
<p>However, this approach requires lifting hundreds or even thousands of tons on conventional <a href="/wiki/Rocket.html" title="Rocket">rockets</a>. This would be very expensive.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Brad Edwards' proposal">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Brad_Edwards.27_proposal" id="Brad_Edwards.27_proposal"></a></p>
<h3>Brad Edwards' proposal</h3>
<p><a  class="new" title="Bradley C. Edwards">Bradley C. Edwards</a>, former Director of Research for the <a  class="new" title="Institute for Scientific Research">Institute for Scientific Research</a> (ISR), based in <a href="/wiki/Fairmont%2C_West_Virginia.html" title="Fairmont, West Virginia">Fairmont, West Virginia</a> has presented a plausible scheme showing how a space elevator could be built in little more than a decade, rather than the far future.</p>
<p>He proposes that a single hair-like 18 <a href="/wiki/Tonne.html" title="Tonne">metric ton</a> (20 short <a href="/wiki/Ton.html" title="Ton">ton</a>) 'seed' cable be deployed in the traditional way, giving a very lightweight elevator with very little lifting capacity.</p>
<p>Then, progressively heavier <a href="/wiki/Cable.html" title="Cable">cables</a> would be pulled up from the ground along it, repeatedly strengthening it until the elevator reaches the required <a href="/wiki/Mass.html" title="Mass">mass</a> and <a href="/wiki/Strength_of_materials.html" title="Strength of materials">strength</a>. This is much the same technique used to build <a href="/wiki/Suspension_bridge.html" title="Suspension bridge">suspension bridges</a>.</p>
<p>Although 18 tonnes for a seed cable may sound like a lot, it would actually be very lightweight — the proposed average mass is about 0.2 kilogram per kilometer. Conventional copper telephone wires running to consumer homes weigh about 4 kg/km.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Other designs">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Other_designs" id="Other_designs"></a></p>
<h3>Other designs</h3>
<p>These are far less well developed, and will be mentioned here only in passing.</p>
<p>If the cable provides a useful tensile strength of about 62.5 GPa or above, then it turns out that a constant width cable can reach beyond geosynchronous orbit without breaking under its own weight. The far end can then be turned around and passed back down to the Earth forming a constant width loop. The two sides of the loop are naturally kept apart by <a href="/wiki/Coriolis_force.html" title="Coriolis force">coriolis forces</a> due to the rotation of the Earth and the cable. By exponentially increasing the thickness of the cable from the ground a very quick buildup of a new elevator may be performed (it helps that no active climbers are needed, and power is applied mechanically.) However, because the loop runs at constant speed, joining and leaving the loop may be somewhat challenging, and the strength of the loop is lower than a conventional tapered design, reducing the maximum payload that can be carried without snapping the cable.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a  title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p>Other structures such as mechanically-linked multiple looped designs hanging off of a central exponential tether might also be practical, and would seem to avoid the laser power beaming; this design has higher capacity than a single loop, but still requires perhaps twice as much tether material.</p>

<h2>Failure modes, safety issues and construction difficulties</h2>
<p>As with any structure, there are a number of ways in which things could go wrong. A space elevator would present a considerable navigational hazard, both to aircraft and spacecraft. Aircraft could be dealt with by means of simple air-traffic control restrictions, but impacts by space objects (in particular, by meteoroids and micrometeorites) pose a more difficult problem.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Satellites">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Satellites" id="Satellites"></a></p>
<h3>Satellites</h3>
<p>If nothing were done, essentially all satellites with <a href="/wiki/Perigee.html" title="Perigee">perigees</a> below the top of the elevator will eventually collide. Twice per day, each orbital plane intersects the elevator, as the rotation of the Earth swings the cable around the equator. Usually the satellite and the cable will not line up. However, except for synchronized orbits, the elevator and satellite will eventually occupy the same place at the same time, almost certainly leading to structural failure of the space elevator and destruction of the satellite.</p>
<p>Most active satellites are capable of some degree of orbital maneuvering and could avoid these predictable collisions, but inactive satellites and other orbiting debris would need to be either preemptively removed from orbit by "garbage collectors" or would need to be closely watched and nudged whenever their orbit approaches the elevator. The impulses required would be small, and need be applied only very infrequently; a <a href="/wiki/Laser_broom.html" title="Laser broom">laser broom</a> system may be sufficient to this task. In addition, Brad Edward's design actually allows the elevator to move out of the way, because the fixing point is at sea and mobile. Further, transverse oscillations of the cable could be controlled so as to ensure that the cable avoids satellites on known paths -- the required amplitudes are modest, relative to the cable length.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Meteoroids and micrometeorites">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Meteoroids_and_micrometeorites" id="Meteoroids_and_micrometeorites"></a></p>
<h3>Meteoroids and micrometeorites</h3>
<p><a href="/wiki/Meteoroids.html" title="Meteoroids">Meteoroids</a> present a more difficult problem, since they would not be predictable and much less time would be available to detect and track them as they approach Earth. It is likely that a space elevator would still suffer impacts of some kind, no matter how carefully it is guarded. However, most space elevator designs call for the use of multiple parallel cables separated from each other by <a href="/wiki/Strut.html" title="Strut">struts</a>, with sufficient margin of safety that severing just one or two strands still allows the surviving strands to hold the elevator's entire weight while repairs are performed. If the strands are properly arranged, no single impact would be able to sever enough of them to overwhelm the surviving strands.</p>
<p>Far worse than meteoroids are <a href="/wiki/Micrometeorites.html" title="Micrometeorites">micrometeorites</a>; tiny high-speed particles found in high concentrations at certain altitudes. Avoiding micrometeorites is essentially impossible, and they will ensure that strands of the elevator are continuously being cut. Most methods designed to deal with this involve a design similar to a <a href="/wiki/Hoytether.html" title="Hoytether">hoytether</a> or to a network of strands in a cylindrical or planar arrangement with two or more helical strands. Constructing the cable as a mesh instead of a ribbon helps prevent collateral damage from each micrometeorite impact.</p>
<p>It is not enough, however, that other fibers be able to take over the load of a failed strand — the system must also survive the immediate, dynamical effects of fiber failure, which generates projectiles aimed at the cable itself. For example, if the cable has a working stress of 50 GPa and a <a href="/wiki/Young%27s_modulus.html" title="Young's modulus">Young's modulus</a> of 1000 GPa, its strain will be 0.05 and its stored elastic energy will be 1/2 × 0.05 × 50 GPa = 1.25×10<sup>9</sup> joules per cubic meter. Breaking a fiber will result in a pair of de-tensioning waves moving apart at the speed of sound in the fiber, with the fiber segments behind each wave moving at over 1,000 m/s (more than the muzzle velocity of an <a href="/wiki/M16_rifle.html" title="M16 rifle">M16 rifle</a>). Unless these fast-moving projectiles can be stopped safely, they will break yet other fibers, initiating a failure cascade capable of severing the cable. The challenge of preventing fiber breakage from initiating a catastrophic failure cascade seems to be unaddressed in the current (January, 2005) literature on terrestrial space elevators. Problems of this sort would be easier to solve in lower-tension applications (e.g., lunar elevators).</p>

<p><a name="Corrosion" id="Corrosion"></a></p>
<h3>Corrosion</h3>
<p>Corrosion is a major risk to any thinly built tether (which most designs call for). In the upper atmosphere, <a href="/wiki/Atomic_oxygen.html" title="Atomic oxygen">atomic oxygen</a> steadily eats away at most materials. A tether will consequently need to either be made from a corrosion-resistant material or have a corrosion-resistant coating, adding to weight. <a href="/wiki/Gold.html" title="Gold">Gold</a> and <a href="/wiki/Platinum.html" title="Platinum">platinum</a> have been shown to be practically immune to atomic oxygen; several far more common materials such as <a href="/wiki/Aluminum.html" title="Aluminum">aluminum</a> are damaged very slowly and could be repaired as needed.</p>
<p>Another potential solution to the corrosion problem is a continuous renewal of the tether surface (which could be done from standard, though possibly slower elevators). This process would depend on the tether composition and it could be done in a nanoscale (by replacing individual fibers) or in segments.</p>

<h3>Material defects</h3>
<p>Any structure as large as a space elevator will have massive numbers of tiny defects in the construction material. It has been suggested <sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a  title="">[10]</a></sup>, <sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a  title="">[11]</a></sup> that, because large structures have more defects than small structures, that large structures are inherently weaker than small, giving an estimated carbon microtube strength of only 24GPa down to only 1.7GPa in millimetre-scale samples, the latter equivalent to many high-strength steels, which would be vastly less than that needed to build a space elevator for a reasonable cost.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Weather">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Weather" id="Weather"></a></p>
<h3>Weather</h3>
<p>In the atmosphere, the risk factors of wind and lightning come into play. The basic mitigation is location. As long as the tether's anchor remains within two degrees of the equator, it will remain in the quiet zone between the Earth's <a href="/wiki/Hadley_cell.html" title="Hadley cell">Hadley cells</a>, where there is relatively little violent weather. Remaining storms could be avoided by moving a floating anchor platform. The lightning risk can be minimized by using a nonconductive fiber with a water-resistant coating to help prevent a conductive buildup from forming. The wind risk can be minimized by use of a fiber with a small cross-sectional area that can rotate with the wind to reduce resistance. Ice forming on the cable also presents a potential problem. It could add significantly to the cable's weight and affect the passage of elevator cars. Also, ice falling from the cable could damage elevator cars or possibly the cable itself.</p>
<p>One reasonably <a href="/wiki/As_of_2006.html" title="As of 2006">recent</a> result is that high wind speeds can flatten the elevator cable horizontally across the surface of the Earth perhaps a hundred kilometers. Surprisingly, the stress on the cable is not significantly increased (since the elevator is tens of thousands of kilometers long the percentage increase is tiny) and no major damage is predicted.</p>

<h3>Sabotage</h3>
<p>Sabotage is a relatively unquantifiable problem. A space elevator might prove an attractive target for a terrorist or other politically motivated attack. Concern over sabotage may have an effect on location, adding the constraint of avoiding unstable territories to the existing requirement of an equatorial site.</p>

<p><a name="Vibrational_harmonics" id="Vibrational_harmonics"></a></p>
<h3>Vibrational harmonics</h3>
<p>A final risk of structural failure comes from the possibility of vibrational <a href="/wiki/Harmonic.html" title="Harmonic">harmonics</a> within the cable. Like the shorter and more familiar strings of stringed musical instruments, the cable of a space elevator has a natural <a href="/wiki/Resonance.html" title="Resonance">resonant</a> frequency. If the cable is excited at this frequency, for example by the travel of elevators up and down it, the vibrational energy could build up to dangerous levels and exceed the cable's tensile strength. This can be avoided by the use of suitable damping systems within the cable, and by scheduling travel up and down the cable keeping its resonant frequency in mind. It may even be possible to do damping against Earth's magnetosphere.</p>

<p><a name="In_the_event_of_failure" id="In_the_event_of_failure"></a></p>
<h3>In the event of failure</h3>
<p>If despite all these precautions the elevator is severed anyway, the resulting scenario depends on where exactly the break occurred:</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Cut near the anchor point">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Cut_near_the_anchor_point" id="Cut_near_the_anchor_point"></a></p>
<h4>Cut near the anchor point</h4>
<p>If the elevator is cut at its anchor point on Earth's surface, the outward force exerted by the counterweight would cause the entire elevator to rise upward into a stable orbit. This is because a space elevator must be kept in tension, with greater centrifugal force pulling outward than <a href="/wiki/Gravity.html" title="Gravity">gravitational</a> force pulling inward, or any additional payload added at the elevator's bottom end would pull the entire structure down.</p>
<p>The ultimate <a href="/wiki/Altitude.html" title="Altitude">altitude</a> of the severed lower end of the cable would depend on the details of the elevator's <a href="/wiki/Mass.html" title="Mass">mass</a> distribution. In theory, the loose end might be secured and fastened down again. This would be an extremely tricky operation, however, requiring careful adjustment of the cable's center of gravity to bring the cable back down to the surface again at just the right location. It may prove to be easier to build a new system in such a situation.</p>

<p><a name="Cut_at_about_25.2C000_km" id="Cut_at_about_25.2C000_km"></a></p>
<h4>Cut at about 25,000 km</h4>
<p>If the break occurred at higher altitude, up to about 25,000 km, the lower portion of the elevator would descend to Earth and drape itself along the equator east of the anchor point, while the now unbalanced upper portion would rise to a higher orbit. Some authors (such as science fiction writers <a href="/wiki/David_Gerrold.html" title="David Gerrold">David Gerrold</a> in <i><a  class="new" title="Jumping off the Planet">Jumping off the Planet</a></i>, <a href="/wiki/Kim_Stanley_Robinson.html" title="Kim Stanley Robinson">Kim Stanley Robinson</a> in <i><a href="/wiki/Red_Mars.html" title="Red Mars">Red Mars</a></i>, and <a href="/wiki/Ben_Bova.html" title="Ben Bova">Ben Bova</a> in <i>Mercury</i>) have suggested that such a failure would be catastrophic, with the thousands of kilometers of falling cable creating a swath of meteoric destruction along Earth's surface. However, in most cable designs, the upper portion of any cable that fell to Earth would burn up in the <a href="/wiki/Earth%27s_atmosphere.html" title="Earth's atmosphere">atmosphere</a>. Additionally because proposed initial cables (the only ones likely to be broken) have very low mass (roughly 1 kg per kilometer) and are flat, the bottom portion would likely settle to Earth with less force than a sheet of paper due to <a href="/wiki/Air_resistance.html" title="Air resistance">air resistance</a> on the way down.</p>
<p>If the break occurred at the counterweight side of the elevator the lower portion, now including the "central station" of the elevator would entirely fall down if not prevented by an early self-destruct of the cable shortly below it. Depending on the size however it would burn up on re-entry anyway.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Elevator climbers">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Elevator_climbers" id="Elevator_climbers"></a></p>
<h4>Elevator climbers</h4>
<p>Any climbers on the falling section would also reenter Earth's atmosphere, but it is likely that the climbers will already have been designed to withstand such an event as an emergency measure. It is almost inevitable that some objects — climbers, structural members, repair crews, etc. — will accidentally fall off the elevator at some point. Their subsequent fate would depend upon their initial altitude. Except at geosynchronous altitude, an object on a space elevator is not in a stable orbit and so its trajectory will not remain parallel to it. The object will instead enter an <a href="/wiki/Elliptical_orbit.html" title="Elliptical orbit">elliptical orbit</a>, the characteristics of which depend on where the object was on the elevator when it was released.</p>
<p>If the initial height of the object falling off of the elevator is less than 23,000 km, its <a href="/wiki/Orbit.html" title="Orbit">orbit</a> will have an <a href="/wiki/Apogee.html" title="Apogee">apogee</a> at the altitude where it was released from the elevator and a <a href="/wiki/Perigee.html" title="Perigee">perigee</a> within Earth's atmosphere — it will intersect the atmosphere within a few hours, and not complete an entire orbit. Above this critical altitude, the perigee is above the atmosphere and the object will be able to complete a full orbit to return to the altitude it started from. By then the elevator would be somewhere else, but a <a href="/wiki/Spacecraft.html" title="Spacecraft">spacecraft</a> could be dispatched to retrieve the object or otherwise remove it. The lower the altitude at which the object falls off, the greater the eccentricity of its orbit.</p>
<p>If the object falls off at the geostationary altitude itself, it will remain nearly motionless relative to the elevator just as in conventional orbital flight. At higher altitudes the object would again be in an elliptical orbit, this time with a perigee at the altitude the object was released from and an apogee somewhere higher than that. The eccentricity of the orbit would increase with the altitude from which the object is released.</p>
<p>Above 47,000 km, however, an object that falls off of the elevator would have a velocity greater than the local <a href="/wiki/Escape_velocity.html" title="Escape velocity">escape velocity</a> of Earth. The object would head out into interplanetary space, and if there were any people present on board it might prove impossible to rescue them.</p>

<p><a name="Van_Allen_Belts" id="Van_Allen_Belts"></a></p>
<h3>Van Allen Belts</h3>
<p>The space elevator would run through the <a href="/wiki/Van_Allen_radiation_belt.html" title="Van Allen radiation belt">Van Allen belts</a>. This is not a problem for most freight, but the amount of time a climber spends in this region would cause <a href="/wiki/Radiation_poisoning.html" title="Radiation poisoning">radiation poisoning</a> to any unshielded human or other living things.</p>
<p>Some people speculate that passengers and other living things will continue to travel by high-speed rocket, while the space elevator hauls bulk cargo. Research into lightweight <a href="/wiki/Radiation_shielding.html" title="Radiation shielding">shielding</a> and techniques for clearing out the belts is underway.</p>
<p>More conventional and faster <a href="/wiki/Atmospheric_reentry.html" title="Atmospheric reentry">atmospheric reentry</a> techniques such as <a href="/wiki/Aerobraking.html" title="Aerobraking">aerobraking</a> might be employed on the way down to minimize radiation exposure. De-orbit burns use relatively little fuel, and so can be cheap.</p>
<p>An obvious option would be for the elevator to carry shielding to protect passengers, though this would reduce its overall capacity, of course. Alternatively, the shielding itself could in some cases consist of useful payload, for example food, water, fuel or construction/maintenance materials, and no additional shielding costs are then incurred on the way up.</p>
<p>To shield passengers from the radiation in the Van Allen belt, perhaps counter-intuitively, material composed of light elements should be used, as opposed to lead shielding. In fact, high energy <a href="/wiki/Electron.html" title="Electron">electrons</a> in the Van Allen belts produce dangerous <a href="/wiki/X-ray.html" title="X-ray">X-rays</a> when they strike <a href="/wiki/Atom.html" title="Atom">atoms</a> of <a href="/wiki/Heavy_element.html" title="Heavy element">heavy elements</a>. This is known as <a href="/wiki/Bremsstrahlung.html" title="Bremsstrahlung">bremsstrahlung</a>, or braking radiation.

<p>With a space elevator, materials might be sent into orbit at a fraction of the current cost. Modern rocketry gives prices that are on the order of thousands of <a href="/wiki/U.S._dollar.html" title="U.S. dollar">U.S. dollars</a> per <a href="/wiki/Kilogram.html" title="Kilogram">kilogram</a> for transfer to <a href="/wiki/Low_earth_orbit.html" title="Low earth orbit">low earth orbit</a>, and roughly twenty thousand dollars per kilogram for transfer to geosynchronous orbit. For a space elevator, the price could be on the order of a few hundred dollars per kilogram, or possibly much less.</p>
<p>Space elevators have high capital cost but low operating expenses, so they make the most economic sense in a situation where it would be used over a long period of time to handle very large amounts of payload. The current launch market may not be large enough to make a compelling case for a space elevator, but a dramatic drop in the price of launching material to orbit would likely result in new types of space activities becoming economically feasible. In this regard they share similarities with other transportation infrastructure projects such as highways or railroads.</p>
<p>Development costs might be roughly equivalent, in modern dollars, to the cost of developing the shuttle system. A question subject to speculation is whether a space elevator would return the investment, or if it would be more beneficial to instead spend the money on developing rocketry further. If the elevator did indeed cost roughly the same as the shuttle program, recovering the development costs would take less than about a hundred thousand tons launched to low earth orbit or five thousand tons launched to geosynchronous orbit.</p>

<p><a name="Political_issues" id="Political_issues"></a></p>
<h2>Political issues</h2>
<p>One potential problem with a space elevator would be the issue of ownership and control. Such an elevator would require significant investment (estimates <i>start</i> at about <a href="/wiki/United_States_dollar.html" title="United States dollar">US$</a>5 billion for a very primitive tether), and it could take at least a decade to recoup such expenses. At present, very few entities are able to spend in the space industry at that magnitude.</p>
<p>Assuming a multi-national governmental effort was able to produce a working space elevator, many political issues would remain to be solved. Which countries would use the elevator and how often? Who would be responsible for its defense from <a href="/wiki/Terrorism.html" title="Terrorism">terrorists</a> or enemy states? A space elevator could potentially cause rifts between states over the military applications of the elevator. Furthermore, establishment of a space elevator would require knowledge of the positions and paths of all existing satellites in Earth orbit and their removal if they cannot adequately avoid the elevator (unless the base station itself can move in order to make the elevator avoid satellites, as proposed by Edwards).</p>
<p>An initial elevator could be used in relatively short order to lift the materials to build more such elevators, but the owners of the first elevator might refuse to carry such materials in order to maintain their <a href="/wiki/Monopoly.html" title="Monopoly">monopoly</a>.</p>
<p>As space elevators (regardless of the design) are inherently fragile but militarily valuable structures, they would likely be targeted immediately in any major conflict with a state that controls one. Consequently, most militaries would elect to continue development of conventional rockets (or other similar launch technologies) to provide effective backup methods to access space.</p>
<p>The cost of the space elevator is not excessive compared to other projects and it is conceivable that several countries or an international consortium could pursue the space elevator. Indeed, there are companies and agencies in a number of countries that have expressed interest in the concept. Generally, projects on the scale of a space elevator need to be either joint public-private partnership ventures or government ventures, and they involve multiple partners. It is also possible that a private entity (risks notwithstanding) could provide the financing — several large investment firms have stated interest in construction of the space elevator as a private endeavor.</p>
<p>The political motivation for a collaborative effort comes from the potential destabilizing nature of the space elevator. The space elevator clearly has military applications, but more critically it would give a strong economic advantage for the controlling entity. Information flowing through satellites, future energy from space, planets full of real estate and associated minerals, and basic military advantage could all potentially be controlled by the entity that controls access to space through the space elevator. An international collaboration could result in multiple elevators at various locations around the globe, since subsequent elevators would be significantly cheaper, thus allowing general access to space and consequently eliminating the instabilities a single system might cause.</p>
<p>Arthur C. Clarke compared the space elevator project to <a href="/wiki/Cyrus_Field.html" title="Cyrus Field">Cyrus Field</a>'s efforts to build the first <a href="/wiki/Transatlantic_telegraph_cable.html" title="Transatlantic telegraph cable">transatlantic telegraph cable</a>, "the Apollo Project of its age".<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a  title="">[12]</a></sup></p>

<h3>Early concepts</h3>
<p>The concept of the space elevator first appeared in 1895 when a <a href="/wiki/Russia.html" title="Russia">Russian</a> scientist <a href="/wiki/Konstantin_Tsiolkovsky.html" title="Konstantin Tsiolkovsky">Konstantin Tsiolkovsky</a> was inspired by the <a href="/wiki/Eiffel_Tower.html" title="Eiffel Tower">Eiffel Tower</a> in <a href="/wiki/Paris.html" title="Paris">Paris</a> to consider a tower that reached all the way into space. He imagined placing a "celestial castle" at the end of a spindle-shaped cable, with the "castle" orbiting <a href="/wiki/Earth.html" title="Earth">Earth</a> in a geosynchronous orbit (i.e. the castle would remain over the same spot on Earth's surface). The tower would be built from the ground up to an altitude of <a href="/wiki/1_E7_m.html" title="1 E7 m">35,790 kilometers</a> above mean sea level (<a href="/wiki/Geostationary_orbit.html" title="Geostationary orbit">geostationary orbit</a>). Comments from <a href="/wiki/Nikola_Tesla.html" title="Nikola Tesla">Nikola Tesla</a> suggest that he may have also conceived such a tower. Tsiolkovsky's notes were sent behind the <a href="/wiki/Iron_Curtain.html" title="Iron Curtain">Iron Curtain</a> after his death.</p>
<p>Tsiolkovsky's tower would be able to launch objects into orbit without a rocket. Since the elevator would attain orbital velocity as it rode up the cable, an object released at the tower's top would also have the orbital velocity necessary to remain in geosynchronous orbit.</p>

<h3>Twentieth century</h3>
<p>Building from the ground up, however, proved an impossible task; there was no material in existence with enough compressive strength to support its own weight under such conditions. It took until 1957 for another Russian scientist, <a href="/wiki/Yuri_N._Artsutanov.html" title="Yuri N. Artsutanov">Yuri N. Artsutanov</a>, to conceive of a more feasible scheme for building a space tower. Artsutanov suggested using a geosynchronous <a href="/wiki/Satellite.html" title="Satellite">satellite</a> as the base from which to construct the tower. By using a <a href="/wiki/Counterweight.html" title="Counterweight">counterweight</a>, a cable would be lowered from geosynchronous orbit to the surface of Earth while the counterweight was extended from the satellite away from Earth, keeping the center of gravity of the cable motionless relative to Earth. Artsutanov published his idea in the Sunday supplement of <i><a href="/wiki/Komsomolskaya_Pravda.html" title="Komsomolskaya Pravda">Komsomolskaya Pravda</a></i> in 1960. He also proposed tapering the cable thickness so that the tension in the cable was constant—this gives a thin cable at ground level, thickening up towards <a href="/wiki/Geostationary_orbit.html" title="Geostationary orbit">GEO</a>.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a  title="">[13]</a></sup></p>
<p>Making a cable over 35,000 <a href="/wiki/Kilometer.html" title="Kilometer">kilometers</a> long is a difficult task. In 1966, four <a href="/wiki/United_States.html" title="United States">American</a> engineers decided to determine what type of material would be required to build a space elevator, assuming it would be a straight cable with no variations in its cross section. They found that the strength required would be twice that of any existing material including <a href="/wiki/Graphite.html" title="Graphite">graphite</a>, <a href="/wiki/Quartz.html" title="Quartz">quartz</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Diamond.html" title="Diamond">diamond</a>.</p>
<p>In 1975 an American scientist, <a  class="new" title="Jerome Pearson">Jerome Pearson</a>, designed a tapered cross section that would be better suited to building the elevator. The completed cable would be thickest at the geosynchronous orbit, where the tension was greatest, and would be narrowest at the tips to reduce the amount of weight per unit area of cross section that any point on the cable would have to bear. He suggested using a counterweight that would be slowly extended out to 144,000 kilometers (almost half the distance to the <a href="/wiki/Moon.html" title="Moon">Moon</a>) as the lower section of the elevator was built. Without a large counterweight, the upper portion of the cable would have to be longer than the lower due to the way <a href="/wiki/Gravity.html" title="Gravity">gravitational</a> and <a href="/wiki/Centrifugal_force.html" title="Centrifugal force">centrifugal forces</a> change with distance from Earth. His analysis included disturbances such as the gravitation of the Moon, wind and moving payloads up and down the cable. The weight of the material needed to build the elevator would have required thousands of <a href="/wiki/Space_Shuttle.html" title="Space Shuttle">Space Shuttle</a> trips, although part of the material could be transported up the elevator when a minimum strength strand reached the ground or be manufactured in space from <a href="/wiki/Asteroid.html" title="Asteroid">asteroidal</a> or lunar ore.</p>
<p>In 1977, <a href="/wiki/Hans_Moravec.html" title="Hans Moravec">Hans Moravec</a> published an article called "A Non-Synchronous Orbital Skyhook", in which he proposed a modification of the space elevator idea into a more feasible <a href="/wiki/Tether_propulsion.html" title="Tether propulsion">tether propulsion</a> system. (<i>Journal of the Astronautical Sciences</i>, Vol. 25, Oct.-Dec. 1977)</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Arthur_C._Clarke.html" title="Arthur C. Clarke">Arthur C. Clarke</a> introduced the concept of a space elevator to a broader audience in his 1978 novel, <i><a href="/wiki/The_Fountains_of_Paradise.html" title="The Fountains of Paradise">The Fountains of Paradise</a></i>, in which engineers construct a space elevator on top of a mountain peak in the fictional island country of <i>Taprobane</i> (which is actually an early name for Sri Lanka).</p>

Funding to date has been through a grant from <a href="/wiki/NASA_Institute_for_Advanced_Concepts.html" title="NASA Institute for Advanced Concepts">NASA Institute for Advanced Concepts</a>. Future funding is sought through NASA, the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Defense.html" title="United States Department of Defense">United States Department of Defense</a>, private, and public sources. The largest holdup to Edwards' proposed design is the technological limits of the tether material. His calculations call for a fiber composed of epoxy-bonded <a href="/wiki/Carbon_nanotube.html" title="Carbon nanotube">carbon nanotubes</a> with a minimal tensile strength of 130 <a href="/wiki/Pascal.html" title="Pascal">GPa</a>; however, tests in 2000 of individual single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs), which should be notably stronger than an epoxy-bonded rope, indicated the strongest measured as 52 GPa.<sup id="_ref-Yu_2000_PRL_1" class="reference"><a  title="">[5]</a></sup> Multi-walled carbon nanotubes have been measured with tensile strengths up to 63 GPa.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a  title="">[15]</a></sup></p>
<p>Space elevator proponents are planning competitions for space elevator technologies,<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a  title="">[16]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a  title="">[17]</a></sup> similar to the <a href="/wiki/Ansari_X_Prize.html" title="Ansari X Prize">Ansari X Prize</a>. <a  class="new" title="Elevator:2010">Elevator:2010</a> will organize annual competitions for climbers, ribbons and power-beaming systems.
