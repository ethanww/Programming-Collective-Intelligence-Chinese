<p>The <b>Manhattan Project</b> refers to the effort to develop the first <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_weapon.html" title="Nuclear weapon">nuclear weapons</a> during <a href="/wiki/World_War_II.html" title="World War II">World War II</a> by the <a href="/wiki/United_States.html" title="United States">United States</a> with assistance from the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom.html" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> and <a href="/wiki/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canada</a>. Formally designated as the <b>Manhattan Engineering District</b> (<b>MED</b>), it refers specifically to the period of the project from 1942-1946 under the control of the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Army_Corps_of_Engineers.html" title="United States Army Corps of Engineers">U.S. Army Corps of Engineers</a>, under the administration of General <a href="/wiki/Leslie_Groves.html" title="Leslie Groves">Leslie R.

Robert Oppenheimer">J. Robert Oppenheimer</a>.</p>
<p>The project succeeded in developing and detonating three nuclear weapons in 1945: a <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_testing.html" title="Nuclear testing">test detonation</a> on <a href="/wiki/July_16.html" title="July 16">July 16</a> (the <a href="/wiki/Trinity_test.html" title="Trinity test">Trinity test</a>) near <a href="/wiki/Alamogordo%2C_New_Mexico.html" title="Alamogordo, New Mexico">Alamogordo, New Mexico</a>; an <a href="/wiki/Enriched_uranium.html" title="Enriched uranium">enriched uranium</a> bomb code-named "<a href="/wiki/Little_Boy.html" title="Little Boy">Little Boy</a>" detonated on <a href="/wiki/August_6.html" title="August 6">August 6</a> over <a href="/wiki/Hiroshima.html" title="Hiroshima">Hiroshima</a>, <a href="/wiki/Japan.html" title="Japan">Japan</a>; and a <a href="/wiki/Plutonium.html" title="Plutonium">plutonium</a> bomb code-named "<a href="/wiki/Fat_Man.html" title="Fat Man">Fat Man</a>" on <a href="/wiki/August_9.html" title="August 9">August 9</a> over <a href="/wiki/Nagasaki.html" title="Nagasaki">Nagasaki</a>, Japan.</p>
<p>The project's roots lay in scientists' fears since the 1930s that <a href="/wiki/Nazi_Germany.html" title="Nazi Germany">Nazi Germany</a> was also <a href="/wiki/German_nuclear_energy_project.html" title="German nuclear energy project">investigating such weapons of its own</a>. Born out of a small research program which began in 1939, the Manhattan Project would eventually employ over 130,000 people and cost a total of nearly $2 billion <a href="/wiki/USD.html" title="USD">USD</a> ($20 billion in 2004 dollars based on <a href="/wiki/Consumer_price_index.html" title="Consumer price index">CPI</a>), and result in the creation of multiple production and research sites operated in secret.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a  title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>The three primary research and production sites of the project were the plutonium-production facility at what is now <a href="/wiki/Hanford_Site.html" title="Hanford Site">Hanford Site</a>, the uranium-enrichment facilities at what is now <a href="/wiki/Oak_Ridge_National_Laboratory.html" title="Oak Ridge National Laboratory">Oak Ridge National Laboratory</a>, and the weapons research and design laboratory which is now <a href="/wiki/Los_Alamos_National_Laboratory.html" title="Los Alamos National Laboratory">Los Alamos National Laboratory</a>. Project research took place at over thirty different sites spread across the United States, Canada, and in the United Kingdom.

<a href="/wiki/Fascism.html" title="Fascism">Fascism</a> began to take over Europe at the same time as discoveries were being made about the use of nuclear energy for war.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>In the first decades of the <a href="/wiki/Twentieth_century.html" title="Twentieth century">twentieth century</a>, numerous changes in the understanding of <a href="/wiki/Physics.html" title="Physics">physics</a> occurred which resulted both in the recognition of <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_fission.html" title="Nuclear fission">nuclear fission</a> as a potential energy source and the belief by many that it could be used for a weapon. Chief among these developments were the discovery of a nuclear model of the <a href="/wiki/Atom.html" title="Atom">atom</a>, which by 1932 was thought to consist of a small, dense <a href="/wiki/Atomic_nucleus.html" title="Atomic nucleus">nucleus</a> containing most of the <a href="/wiki/Atomic_mass.html" title="Atomic mass">mass</a> of the atom in the form of <a href="/wiki/Protons.html" title="Protons">protons</a> and <a href="/wiki/Neutrons.html" title="Neutrons">neutrons</a>, surrounded by a shell of <a href="/wiki/Electron.html" title="Electron">electrons</a>. Work on the phenomena of <a href="/wiki/Radioactivity.html" title="Radioactivity">radioactivity</a>, first discovered in <a href="/wiki/Uranium.html" title="Uranium">uranium</a> ores by <a href="/wiki/Henri_Becquerel.html" title="Henri Becquerel">Henri Becquerel</a> in 1896 and followed up by the work of <a href="/wiki/Pierre_Curie.html" title="Pierre Curie">Pierre</a> and <a href="/wiki/Marie_Curie.html" title="Marie Curie">Marie Curie</a> on <a href="/wiki/Radium.html" title="Radium">radium</a>, seemed to promise that atoms, previously thought to be ultimately stable and indivisible, actually had the potential of containing and releasing immense amounts of energy.</p>
<p>Movement along the road towards nuclear fission accelerated in the <a href="/wiki/1930s.html" title="1930s">1930s</a>. In 1932, <a href="/wiki/John_Cockcroft.html" title="John Cockcroft">John Cockcroft</a> and <a href="/wiki/Ernest_Walton.html" title="Ernest Walton">Ernest Walton</a> first "split the atom". In 1934, <a href="/wiki/Ir%C3%A8ne_Joliot-Curie.html" title="Irène Joliot-Curie">Irène</a> and <a href="/wiki/Fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric_Joliot-Curie.html" title="Frédéric Joliot-Curie">Frédéric Joliot-Curie</a> discovered that artificial <a href="/wiki/Radioactivity.html" title="Radioactivity">radioactivity</a> could be induced in stable elements by bombarding them with <a href="/wiki/Alpha_particle.html" title="Alpha particle">alpha particles</a>. The same year <a href="/wiki/Enrico_Fermi.html" title="Enrico Fermi">Enrico Fermi</a> reported similar results when bombarding uranium with neutrons, but he did not immediately appreciate the consequences of his results.</p>
<p>In December 1938, Germans <a href="/wiki/Otto_Hahn.html" title="Otto Hahn">Otto Hahn</a> and <a href="/wiki/Fritz_Strassmann.html" title="Fritz Strassmann">Fritz Strassmann</a> published experimental results about the bombardment of uranium with neutrons, showing that it somehow produced an isotope of <a href="/wiki/Barium.html" title="Barium">barium</a> as a result. Collaborator <a href="/wiki/Lise_Meitner.html" title="Lise Meitner">Lise Meitner</a> (a political refugee in Sweden at the time) and <a href="/wiki/Otto_Robert_Frisch.html" title="Otto Robert Frisch">Otto Robert Frisch</a> correctly interpreted the results as the splitting of the uranium nucleus after the absorption of a neutron—nuclear fission—which released a large amount of <a href="/wiki/Binding_energy.html" title="Binding energy">energy</a> and additional neutrons. In 1933 Hungarian physicist <a href="/wiki/Le%C3%B3_Szil%C3%A1rd.html" title="Leó Szilárd">Leó Szilárd</a> had proposed that if a neutron-driven process released more neutrons than those required to start it, an expanding <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_chain_reaction.html" title="Nuclear chain reaction">nuclear chain reaction</a> might result. Upon <a href="/wiki/Experimentation.html" title="Experimentation">experimentation</a>, he found that the fission of uranium indeed released two or more neutrons on average, though he kept this secret for the time being, fearing its use as a weapon by <a href="/wiki/Fascism.html" title="Fascism">fascist</a> governments. Identical results were soon published by the Joliot-Curie group, however, to the dismay of Szilárd.</p>
<p>That such mechanisms might have implications for civilian power or military weapons was perceived by a number of scientists in many different countries around the same time. While all of these developments in science were occurring, however, many great political changes were happening in <a href="/wiki/Europe.html" title="Europe">Europe</a>. <a href="/wiki/Adolf_Hitler.html" title="Adolf Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> was appointed chancellor of <a href="/wiki/Germany.html" title="Germany">Germany</a> in January 1933. His <a href="/wiki/Anti-Semitic.html" title="Anti-Semitic">anti-Semitic</a> ideology caused all <a href="/wiki/Jewish.html" title="Jewish">Jewish</a> civil servants, which included many physicists at universities, to be <a href="/wiki/Racial_policy_of_Nazi_Germany.html" title="Racial policy of Nazi Germany">fired from their posts</a>. Consequently many European physicists who would later make key discoveries went into exile in the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom.html" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> and the <a href="/wiki/United_States.html" title="United States">United States</a>. After <a href="/wiki/Nazi_Germany.html" title="Nazi Germany">Nazi Germany</a> invaded <a href="/wiki/Poland.html" title="Poland">Poland</a> in 1939, <a href="/wiki/World_War_II.html" title="World War II">World War II</a> began, and many scientists in the United States and the United Kingdom became anxious about what Germany might do with <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_technology.html" title="Nuclear technology">nuclear technology</a>.</p>

</div>
<p>The idea that <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_fission.html" title="Nuclear fission">nuclear fission</a> could be used for both the production of commercial energy as well as potentially for military purposes occurred to many scientists around the world almost simultaneously. Because of the escalating military conflict in Europe, many scientists discontinued publication on the subject for fear of aiding enemy scientists with their research. The primary difficulty, it was soon determined by <a href="/wiki/Niels_Bohr.html" title="Niels Bohr">Niels Bohr</a> and <a href="/wiki/John_Archibald_Wheeler.html" title="John Archibald Wheeler">John Wheeler</a>, was that only one <a href="/wiki/Isotope.html" title="Isotope">isotope</a> of uranium, <a href="/wiki/Uranium-235.html" title="Uranium-235">uranium-235</a> underwent fission, and only 0.7% of all uranium found in nature is uranium-235. The majority of uranium is <a href="/wiki/Uranium-238.html" title="Uranium-238">uranium-238</a>, the presence of which would actually inhibit a fission chain reaction. To make a uranium fission bomb would require the separation of the two almost identical atoms with a relatively high degree of accuracy — a massive amount of effort, depending on how much uranium-235 (<a href="/wiki/Enriched_uranium.html" title="Enriched uranium">enriched uranium</a>) was needed for a bomb, which had not yet been determined.</p>
<p>In the United States, a group of three <a href="/wiki/Hungary.html" title="Hungary">Hungarian</a> <a href="/wiki/Jewish.html" title="Jewish">Jewish</a> refugee physicists, <a href="/wiki/Le%C3%B3_Szil%C3%A1rd.html" title="Leó Szilárd">Leó Szilárd</a>, <a href="/wiki/Edward_Teller.html" title="Edward Teller">Edward Teller</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Eugene_Wigner.html" title="Eugene Wigner">Eugene Wigner</a> believed that the energy released in nuclear fission might be used in bombs by the Germans. <a href="/wiki/Germany.html" title="Germany">Germany</a> had made many early discoveries in the physics of fission and still had a number of formidable physicists, including <a href="/wiki/Werner_Heisenberg.html" title="Werner Heisenberg">Werner Heisenberg</a>, despite the expulsion of Jewish academics. These refugee scientists were desperate to encourage further research in the United States. Politically marginalized, however, they sought the assistance of <a href="/wiki/Albert_Einstein.html" title="Albert Einstein">Albert Einstein</a>, easily the world's most famous physicist at the time and a Jewish refugee himself, in drafting a letter which they would attempt to have delivered to President <a href="/wiki/Franklin_D._Roosevelt.html" title="Franklin D. Roosevelt">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a>. The <a href="/wiki/Einstein-Szil%C3%A1rd_letter.html" title="Einstein-Szilárd letter">Einstein-Szilárd letter</a> was written on <a href="/wiki/August_2.html" title="August 2">August 2</a>, <a href="/wiki/1939.html" title="1939">1939</a>, mostly by Szilárd, warning that "extremely powerful bombs of a new type may thus be constructed" by means of nuclear fission and urging the President to establish funds for further research in the U.S. to determine its feasibility.</p>
<p>The letter eventually made it to Roosevelt over a month later, who authorized the creation of an ad hoc <a href="/wiki/S-1_Uranium_Committee.html" title="S-1 Uranium Committee">Uranium Committee</a> under the chairmanship of <a href="/wiki/National_Bureau_of_Standards.html" title="National Bureau of Standards">National Bureau of Standards</a> chief <a href="/wiki/Lyman_Briggs.html" title="Lyman Briggs">Lyman Briggs</a>. It began small research programs in 1939 at the <a href="/wiki/Naval_Research_Laboratory.html" title="Naval Research Laboratory">Naval Research Laboratory</a> in Washington, where physicist <a href="/wiki/Philip_Abelson.html" title="Philip Abelson">Philip Abelson</a> explored uranium <a href="/wiki/Isotope_separation.html" title="Isotope separation">isotope separation</a>. At <a href="/wiki/Columbia_University.html" title="Columbia University">Columbia University</a> <a href="/wiki/Enrico_Fermi.html" title="Enrico Fermi">Enrico Fermi</a>, who had emigrated because his wife was Jewish, built prototype <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_reactor.html" title="Nuclear reactor">nuclear reactors</a> using various configurations of graphite and uranium. Work, however, proceeded at a relatively slow and uncoordinated pace, in part because the U.S. was not yet involved officially in <a href="/wiki/World_War_II.html" title="World War II">World War II</a>, and because Briggs was somewhat uncomfortable in pursuing the research. In 1940, the Uranium Committee became a section of the newly-established <a href="/wiki/National_Defense_Research_Committee.html" title="National Defense Research Committee">National Defense Research Committee</a> (NDRC), run by the scientist-administrator <a href="/wiki/Vannevar_Bush.html" title="Vannevar Bush">Vannevar Bush</a>, but was still a relatively small effort.</p>

<p>While the U.S. research was pursued at a leisurely pace, work in the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom.html" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> was occurring as well. In March 1940 in <a href="/wiki/Birmingham.html" title="Birmingham">Birmingham</a> UK, two more German emigrés, <a href="/wiki/Otto_Frisch.html" title="Otto Frisch">Otto Frisch</a> and <a href="/wiki/Rudolf_Peierls.html" title="Rudolf Peierls">Rudolf Peierls</a> calculated that an atomic weapon only needed a few pounds of uranium-235, a far smaller amount than most scientists had originally expected, which made it seem highly possible that a weapon could be produced in a short amount of time. They sent their report, the <a href="/wiki/Frisch-Peierls_memorandum.html" title="Frisch-Peierls memorandum">Frisch-Peierls memorandum</a>, to <a href="/wiki/Henry_Tizard.html" title="Henry Tizard">Henry Tizard</a>, chairman of the Committee for the Scientific Survey of <a href="/wiki/Air_Warfare.html" title="Air Warfare">Air Warfare</a>, the most important scientific committee in the British war effort. Tizard set up a sub-committee, the <a href="/wiki/MAUD_Committee.html" title="MAUD Committee">MAUD Committee</a>, to investigate the feasibility in more depth, and after commissioning further research, the MAUD Committe produced their first report in March 1941. The committee confirmed that a uranium bomb could be produced using 25 pounds of uranium-235, and would produce an explosion equivalent to that of 1,800 tons of <a href="/wiki/Trinitrotoluene.html" title="Trinitrotoluene">TNT</a>. The research had also shown that isotopic separation of the required quantity of uranium-235 was technically feasible.</p>
<p>Meanwhile in the U.S., the Uranium Committee had not made comparable progress. The first MAUD Report was sent from Britain to the USA in March 1941 but no comment was received from the USA. A member of the MAUD Committee and Frisch's and Peierl's professor, <a href="/wiki/Marcus_Oliphant.html" title="Marcus Oliphant">Mark Oliphant</a>, flew to the US in August 1941 in a bomber to find out what was being done with the MAUD reports, and was horrified to discover that Lyman Briggs had simply locked them in his safe, telling nobody, not even the other members of the Uranium Committee, which had since become part of the <a href="/wiki/Office_of_Scientific_Research_and_Development.html" title="Office of Scientific Research and Development">Office of Scientific Research and Development</a> in the summer of 1941, because the US was "not at war". There was little urgency elsewhere until Oliphant visited <a href="/wiki/Ernest_Lawrence.html" title="Ernest Lawrence">Ernest Lawrence</a>, <a href="/wiki/James_Conant.html" title="James Conant">James Conant</a>, chairman of the NDRC, and <a href="/wiki/Enrico_Fermi.html" title="Enrico Fermi">Enrico Fermi</a> and told them of the MAUD Report. Lawrence also contacted Conant and <a href="/wiki/Arthur_Compton.html" title="Arthur Compton">Arthur Compton</a>, a physicist and Nobel laureate at the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Chicago.html" title="University of Chicago">University of Chicago</a>, convincing them that they should take Frisch's and Peierl's work very seriously, and collectively, along with Vannevar Bush, an aggressive campaign was made to wrest the weapons research out of the hands of Briggs and to encourage an all-out program.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/National_Academy_of_Sciences.html" title="National Academy of Sciences">National Academy of Sciences</a> then proposed an all-out effort to build nuclear weapons. On <a href="/wiki/October_9.html" title="October 9">October 9</a>, <a href="/wiki/1941.html" title="1941">1941</a>, Bush impressed upon Roosevelt at a meeting the need for an accelerated program, and by November Roosevelt had authorized an "all-out" effort. A new policy committee, the Top Policy Group, was created to inform Roosevelt of bomb development, and allow Bush and his colleagues to guide the project. The first meeting of the group, which discussed the reorganization of the S-1 committee research, took place on <a href="/wiki/December_6.html" title="December 6">December 6</a>, <a href="/wiki/1941.html" title="1941">1941</a> — the day before the Japanese <a href="/wiki/Attack_on_Pearl_Harbor.html" title="Attack on Pearl Harbor">attack on Pearl Harbor</a> and the entrance of the United States into World War II.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>Having begun to wrest control of the uranium research from the National Bureau of Standards, the project heads began to accelerate the bomb project under the <a href="/wiki/Office_of_Scientific_Research_and_Development.html" title="Office of Scientific Research and Development">OSRD</a>. <a href="/wiki/Arthur_Compton.html" title="Arthur Compton">Arthur Compton</a> organized the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Chicago_Metallurgical_Laboratory.html" title="University of Chicago Metallurgical Laboratory">University of Chicago Metallurgical Laboratory</a> in early 1942 to study <a href="/wiki/Plutonium.html" title="Plutonium">plutonium</a> and fission piles (primitive <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_reactor.html" title="Nuclear reactor">nuclear reactors</a>), and asked theoretical physicist <a href="/wiki/Robert_Oppenheimer.html" title="Robert Oppenheimer">Robert Oppenheimer</a> of the <a href="/wiki/University_of_California.html" title="University of California">University of California</a> to take over research on fast neutron calculations, key to calculations about critical mass and weapon detonation, from <a href="/wiki/Gregory_Breit.html" title="Gregory Breit">Gregory Breit</a>. <a href="/wiki/John_Manley_%28physicist%29.html" title="John Manley (physicist)">John Manley</a>, a physicist at the Metallurgical Laboratory, was assigned to help Oppenheimer find answers by coordinating and contacting several experimental physics groups scattered across the country.</p>
<p>During the spring of 1942, Oppenheimer and <a href="/wiki/Robert_Serber.html" title="Robert Serber">Robert Serber</a> of the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Illinois_at_Urbana-Champaign.html" title="University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign">University of Illinois</a>, worked on the problems of neutron diffusion (how neutrons moved in the <a href="/wiki/Chain_reaction.html" title="Chain reaction">chain reaction</a>) and <a href="/wiki/Hydrodynamics.html" title="Hydrodynamics">hydrodynamics</a> (how the explosion produced by the chain reaction might behave). To review this work and the general theory of fission reactions, Oppenheimer convened a summer study at the <a href="/wiki/University_of_California%2C_Berkeley.html" title="University of California, Berkeley">University of California, Berkeley</a> in June 1942. Theorists <a href="/wiki/Hans_Bethe.html" title="Hans Bethe">Hans Bethe</a>, <a href="/wiki/John_Van_Vleck.html" title="John Van Vleck">John Van Vleck</a>, <a href="/wiki/Edward_Teller.html" title="Edward Teller">Edward Teller</a>, <a href="/wiki/Felix_Bloch.html" title="Felix Bloch">Felix Bloch</a>, <a  class="new" title="Emil Konopinski">Emil Konopinski</a>, Robert Serber, <a  class="new" title="Stanley S. Frankel">Stanley S. Frankel</a>, and <a  class="new" title="Eldred C. Nelson">Eldred C. Nelson</a> (the latter three all former students of Oppenheimer) quickly confirmed that a fission bomb was feasible.</p>
<p>There were still many unknown factors in the development of a nuclear bomb, however, even though it was considered to be theoretically possible. The properties of pure <a href="/wiki/Uranium-235.html" title="Uranium-235">uranium-235</a> were still relatively unknown, as were the properties of <a href="/wiki/Plutonium.html" title="Plutonium">plutonium</a>, a new element which had only been discovered in February 1941 by <a href="/wiki/Glenn_Seaborg.html" title="Glenn Seaborg">Glenn Seaborg</a> and his team. Plutonium was the product of uranium-238 absorbing a neutron which had been emitted from a fissioning uranium-235 atom, and was thus able to be created in a nuclear reactor. But at this point no reactor had yet been built, so while plutonium was being pursued as an additional fissile substance, it was not yet to be relied upon. Only microgram quantities of plutonium existed at the time and its properties were still largely unknown.</p>

A number of the different fission bomb assembly methods explored during the summer 1942 conference, later reproduced as drawings in <i><a href="/wiki/The_Los_Alamos_Primer.html" title="The Los Alamos Primer">The Los Alamos Primer</a></i>. In the end, only the "gun" method (at top) and a more complicated variation of the "implosion" design would be used. At the bottom are "autocatalytic method" designs.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The scientists at the Berkeley conference determined that there were many possible ways of arranging the fissile material into a critical mass, the simplest being the shooting a "cylindrical plug" into a sphere of "active material" with a "tamper"—dense material which would focus neutrons inward and keep the reacting mass together to increase its efficiency (this model "avoids fancy shapes", Serber would later write).<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a  title="">[2]</a></sup> They also explored designs involving <a href="/wiki/Spheroid.html" title="Spheroid">spheroids</a>, a primitive form of "implosion" (suggested by <a href="/wiki/Richard_C._Tolman.html" title="Richard C. Tolman">Richard C. Tolman</a>), and explored the speculative possibility of "<a href="/wiki/Autocatalysis.html" title="Autocatalysis">autocatalytic</a> methods" which would increase the efficiency of the bomb as it exploded.</p>
<p>Considering the idea of the fission bomb theoretically settled until more experimental data was available, the conference then turned in a different direction. Hungarian physicist <a href="/wiki/Edward_Teller.html" title="Edward Teller">Edward Teller</a> pushed for discussion on an even more powerful bomb: the "Super", which would use the explosive force of a detonating fission bomb to ignite a <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_fusion.html" title="Nuclear fusion">fusion</a> reaction in <a href="/wiki/Deuterium.html" title="Deuterium">deuterium</a> and <a href="/wiki/Tritium.html" title="Tritium">tritium</a>. This concept was based on studies of energy production in stars made by Hans Bethe before the war, and suggested as a possibility to Teller by <a href="/wiki/Enrico_Fermi.html" title="Enrico Fermi">Enrico Fermi</a> not long before the conference. When the detonation wave from the fission bomb moved through the mixture of deuterium and tritium nuclei, these would fuse together to produce much more energy than fission could. But Bethe was skeptical. As Teller pushed hard for his "superbomb" —now usually referred to as a <a href="/wiki/Teller-Ulam_design.html" title="Teller-Ulam design">hydrogen bomb</a>— proposing scheme after scheme, Bethe refuted each one. The fusion idea had to be put aside in order to concentrate on actually producing fission bombs.</p>
<p>Teller also raised the speculative possibility that an atomic bomb might "ignite" the atmosphere, due to a hypothetical fusion reaction of nitrogen nuclei. Bethe calculated, according to Serber, that it could not happen. In his book <i>The Road from Los Alamos</i>, Bethe says a refutation was written by Konopinski, C. Marvin, and Teller as report LA-602, showing that ignition of the atmosphere was impossible, not just unlikely.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a  title="">[3]</a></sup> In Serber's account, Oppenheimer unfortunately mentioned it to Arthur Compton, who "didn't have enough sense to shut up about it. It somehow got into a document that went to Washington" which led to the question "never [being] laid to rest".<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a  title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>The conferences in the summer of 1942 provided the detailed theoretical basis for the design of the atomic bomb, and convinced Oppenheimer of the benefits of having a single centralized laboratory to manage the research for the bomb project, rather than having specialists spread out at different sites across the United States.</p>

<h2>Project sites</h2>
<p>Though it involved over thirty different research and production sites, the Manhattan Project was largely carried out in three secret scientific cities that were established by power of <a href="/wiki/Eminent_domain.html" title="Eminent domain">eminent domain</a>: <a href="/wiki/Los_Alamos%2C_New_Mexico.html" title="Los Alamos, New Mexico">Los Alamos, New Mexico</a>; <a href="/wiki/Oak_Ridge%2C_Tennessee.html" title="Oak Ridge, Tennessee">Oak Ridge, Tennessee</a>; and <a href="/wiki/Hanford%2C_Washington.html" title="Hanford, Washington">Hanford, Washington</a>. The latter two sites were chosen to gain access to the vast quantities of cheap (hydro-)electrical power available locally, which were necessary for the production of uranium-235 and plutonium.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Los_Alamos_National_Laboratory.html" title="Los Alamos National Laboratory">Los Alamos National Laboratory</a> was built on a mesa that previously hosted the <a href="/wiki/Los_Alamos_Ranch_School.html" title="Los Alamos Ranch School">Los Alamos Ranch School</a>. The site was chosen primarily for its remoteness from prying eyes. In addition to being the main 'think-tank', Los Alamos was responsible for final assembly of the bombs, mainly from materials and components produced by the other sites. Manufacturing undertaken at Los Alamos included casings and explosive lenses.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Oak_Ridge_National_Laboratory.html" title="Oak Ridge National Laboratory">Oak Ridge facilities</a> cover more than 60,000 acres (243 km²) of several former farm communities in the <a href="/wiki/Tennessee_Valley.html" title="Tennessee Valley">Tennessee Valley</a> area. Some Tennessee families were given two weeks' notice to vacate family farm lands that had been their home for generations. So secret was the site during WW2 that even the state governor was unaware that Oak Ridge (what was to become the fifth largest city in the state) was being built. At one point Oak Ridge plants were consuming 1/7th of all the electrical power being produced in the USA, more than the whole of New York City. Oak Ridge mainly produced uranium-235.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Hanford_Site.html" title="Hanford Site">Hanford Site</a>, which grew to almost 1000 square miles (2,600&#160;km²), took over irrigated farm land, fruit orchards, a railroad, and two active farming communities, <a href="/wiki/Hanford%2C_Washington.html" title="Hanford, Washington">Hanford</a> and <a href="/wiki/White_Bluffs%2C_Washington.html" title="White Bluffs, Washington">White Bluffs</a>, in a sparsely populated area adjacent to the <a href="/wiki/Columbia_River.html" title="Columbia River">Columbia River</a>. Hanford was the plutonium production centre.</p>
<p>The existence of these sites and the secret cities of Los Alamos, Oak Ridge, and Hanford were not made public until the announcement of the Hiroshima explosion and remained officially secret until the end of WWII.</p>

<h2>Need for coordination</h2>
<p>The measurements of the interactions of <a href="/wiki/Fast_neutron.html" title="Fast neutron">fast neutrons</a> with the materials in a bomb were essential because the number of neutrons produced in the fission of uranium and plutonium must be known, and because the substance surrounding the nuclear material must have the ability to <a href="/wiki/Neutron_reflector.html" title="Neutron reflector">reflect</a>, or scatter, neutrons back into the chain reaction before it is blown apart in order to increase the energy produced. Therefore, the <a href="/wiki/Neutron_scattering.html" title="Neutron scattering">neutron scattering</a> properties of materials had to be measured to find the best reflectors.</p>
<p>Estimating the explosive power required knowledge of many other nuclear properties, including the <a href="/wiki/Cross_section_%28physics%29.html" title="Cross section (physics)">cross section</a> (a measure of the probability of an encounter between particles that result in a specified effect) for nuclear processes of neutrons in uranium and other elements. Fast neutrons could only be produced in <a href="/wiki/Particle_accelerator.html" title="Particle accelerator">particle accelerators</a>, which were still relatively uncommon instruments in physics departments in 1942.</p>
<p>The need for better coordination was clear. By September 1942, the difficulties involved with conducting preliminary studies on nuclear weapons at universities scattered throughout the country indicated the need for a laboratory dedicated solely to that purpose. An even greater need was the construction of massive industrial plants to produce uranium-235 and plutonium - the fissionable materials that would provide the nuclear explosives.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Vannevar_Bush.html" title="Vannevar Bush">Vannevar Bush</a>, the head of the civilian <a href="/wiki/Office_of_Scientific_Research_and_Development.html" title="Office of Scientific Research and Development">Office of Scientific Research and Development</a> (OSRD), asked President Roosevelt to assign the large-scale operations connected with the quickly growing nuclear weapons project to the military. Roosevelt chose the Army to work with the OSRD in building production plants. The <a href="/wiki/Army_Corps_of_Engineers.html" title="Army Corps of Engineers">Army Corps of Engineers</a> selected <a  class="new" title="Col. James Marshall">Col. James Marshall</a> to oversee the construction of factories to separate uranium isotopes and manufacture plutonium for the bomb.</p>
<p>Marshall and his deputy, Col. <a  class="new" title="Kenneth Nichols">Kenneth Nichols</a>, had to struggle to understand the various proposed processes and the scientists with whom they had to work. Thrust suddenly into the new field of nuclear physics, they felt unable to distinguish between technical and personal preferences. Although they decided that a site near <a href="/wiki/Knoxville%2C_Tennessee.html" title="Knoxville, Tennessee">Knoxville</a> would be suitable for the first production plant, they did not know how large the site had to be and so put off its acquisition. There were other problems, too.</p>
<p>Because of its experimental nature, the nuclear weapons work could not compete with the Army's more-urgent tasks for top-priority ratings. The selection of scientists' work and production-plant construction often were delayed by Marshall's inability to get the critical materials, such as <a href="/wiki/Steel.html" title="Steel">steel</a>, that also were needed in other military productions.</p>
<p>Even selecting a name for the new Army project was difficult. The title chosen by Gen. Brehon Somervell, "Development of Substitute Materials," was objectionable because it seemed to reveal too much.</p>

</div>
<p>In the summer of 1942, Col. <a href="/wiki/Leslie_Groves.html" title="Leslie Groves">Leslie Groves</a> was deputy to the chief of construction for the <a href="/wiki/Army_Corps_of_Engineers.html" title="Army Corps of Engineers">Army Corps of Engineers</a> and had overseen construction of <a href="/wiki/The_Pentagon.html" title="The Pentagon">the Pentagon</a>, the world's largest office building. Hoping for an overseas command, Groves vigorously objected when Somervell appointed him to take charge of the weapons project. His objections were overruled and Groves resigned himself to leading a project he thought had little chance of succeeding. Groves appointed Oppenheimer as the project's scientific director, to the surprise of many. (Oppenheimer's radical political views were thought to pose security problems).</p>
<p>The first thing Groves did was rechristen the project <b>The Manhattan District</b>. The name evolved from the Corps of Engineers practice of naming districts after its headquarters' city (Marshall's headquarters were in New York City). At the same time, Groves was promoted to <a href="/wiki/Brigadier_general.html" title="Brigadier general">brigadier general</a>, which gave him the rank thought necessary to deal with the senior scientists in the project.</p>
<p>Within a week of his appointment, Groves had solved the Manhattan Project's most urgent problems. His forceful and effective manner was soon to become all too familiar to the atomic scientists.</p>
<p>The first major scientific hurdle of the project was solved on <a href="/wiki/December_2.html" title="December 2">December 2</a>, 1942 beneath the <a href="/wiki/Bleachers.html" title="Bleachers">bleachers</a> of <a href="/wiki/Stagg_Field.html" title="Stagg Field">Stagg Field</a> at the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Chicago.html" title="University of Chicago">University of Chicago</a>, where a team led by <a href="/wiki/Enrico_Fermi.html" title="Enrico Fermi">Enrico Fermi</a> initiated the first self-sustaining <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_chain_reaction.html" title="Nuclear chain reaction">nuclear chain reaction</a> in an experimental reactor named <a href="/wiki/Chicago_Pile-1.html" title="Chicago Pile-1">Chicago Pile-1</a>. A coded phone call from Compton saying, "The Italian navigator (referring to Fermi) has landed in the new world, the natives are friendly" to Conant in Washington, DC, brought the news that the experiment was a success. This was a major turning point.</p>

<p>The <a href="/wiki/Hiroshima.html" title="Hiroshima">Hiroshima</a> bomb, <a href="/wiki/Little_Boy.html" title="Little Boy">Little Boy</a>, was made from uranium-235, a rare <a href="/wiki/Isotope.html" title="Isotope">isotope</a> of <a href="/wiki/Uranium.html" title="Uranium">uranium</a> that has to be <a href="/wiki/Isotope_separation.html" title="Isotope separation">physically separated</a> from the more prevalent uranium-238 isotope, which is not suitable for use in an explosive device. Since U-235 is only 0.7% of raw uranium and is chemically identical to the 99.3% of U-238, various physical methods were considered for separation.</p>

<p>One method of separating uranium 235 from raw uranium ore was devised by <a href="/wiki/Francis_Simon.html" title="Francis Simon">Franz Simon</a> and <a href="/wiki/Nicholas_Kurti.html" title="Nicholas Kurti">Nicholas Kurti</a>, two more Jewish émigrés, at <a href="/wiki/University_of_Oxford.html" title="University of Oxford">Oxford University</a>.

<p>Another method - <a href="/wiki/Electromagnetic_isotope_separation.html" title="Electromagnetic isotope separation">electromagnetic isotope separation</a>, was developed by Ernest Lawrence at the <a href="/wiki/University_of_California_Radiation_Laboratory.html" title="University of California Radiation Laboratory">University of California Radiation Laboratory</a> at the <a href="/wiki/University_of_California%2C_Berkeley.html" title="University of California, Berkeley">University of California, Berkeley</a>.

Plutonium is a synthetic element.</p>
<p>Although uranium-238 is useless as fissile material for an atomic bomb, U-238 is used to produce plutonium. The fission of U-235 produces relatively slow neutrons which will be absorbed by U-238, which after a few days of decay, turns into plutonium-239. The production and purification of plutonium used techniques developed in part by <a href="/wiki/Glenn_Seaborg.html" title="Glenn Seaborg">Glenn Seaborg</a> while working at Berkeley and Chicago. Beginning in 1943, huge plants were built to produce plutonium at <a href="/wiki/Hanford_Site.html" title="Hanford Site">Hanford (Site W)</a> outside of <a href="/wiki/Richland%2C_Washington.html" title="Richland, Washington">Richland, Washington</a>.</p>

The plutonium bomb, Fat Man</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>From 1943-1944 development efforts were directed to a <a href="/wiki/Gun-type_fission_weapon.html" title="Gun-type fission weapon">gun-type fission weapon</a> with plutonium, called "<a href="/wiki/Thin_Man_bomb.html" title="Thin Man bomb">Thin Man</a>". Once this would be achieved, the uranium version "Little Boy" would require a relatively simple adaptation, it was thought.</p>
<p>Initial tests of the properties of plutonium were done using <a href="/wiki/Cyclotron.html" title="Cyclotron">cyclotron</a>-generated plutonium-239, which was very pure but in very small amounts. On <a href="/wiki/April_5.html" title="April 5">April 5</a>, <a href="/wiki/1944.html" title="1944">1944</a>, <a href="/wiki/Emilio_Segr%C3%A8.html" title="Emilio Segrè">Emilio Segrè</a> at Los Alamos received the first sample of Hanford-produced plutonium. Within ten days, he discovered a fatal flaw: reactor-bred plutonium was far less pure than cyclotron-produced plutonium, and as a result had a much higher spontaneous fission rate than uranium-235. The isotope responsible for this high fission rate was plutonium-240, formed from plutonium-239 by capture of an additional neutron. Unlike the cyclotron, the plutonium breeding reactors had a much higher neutron flux, thus increasing the proportion of plutonium-240 as compared to the cyclotron bred plutonium. The implications of this made a "gun" detonation mechanism unsuitable: because of the relatively slow speed of the gun mechanism, a plutonium bomb would "fizzle" (i.e. blow itself apart before it developed a substantial chain reaction).</p>
<p>Therefore in July 1944 the difficult decision was made to cease work on the plutonium gun method; there would be no "Thin Man." The gun method was further developed for uranium only, which as expected, gave few complications. Most efforts were now directed to a different method for plutonium.</p>

In July 1944 the laboratory abandoned the plutonium gun-type bomb ("<a href="/wiki/Thin_Man_%28bomb%29.html" title="Thin Man (bomb)">Thin Man</a>", <i>shown above</i>) and focused almost entirely around the problem of implosion.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Ideas of using alternative detonation schemes had existed for some time at Los Alamos. One of the more innovative had been the idea of "implosion" — a sub-critical sphere of fissile material could, using chemical explosives, be forced to collapse in on itself, creating a very dense critical mass. Initially it had been entertained as a possible, though unlikely method. But after it was discovered that it was the only possible solution for using plutonium in a nuclear weapon, it received the highest project priority. By the end of July 1944, the entire project had been re-organized around solving the implosion problem. It eventually involved using <a href="/wiki/Shaped_charge.html" title="Shaped charge">shaped charges</a> with many explosive lenses in order to produce the perfectly-spherical explosive wave needed for proper compression of the plutonium sphere.</p>
<p>Because of the complexity of detonating an implosion-style weapon necessary for the plutonium bomb, it was decided that in spite of the waste of expensive fissile material, a test would be required in order to have any confidence that it would work in practice. After much preparation, the first <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_test.html" title="Nuclear test">nuclear test</a> took place on <a href="/wiki/July_16.html" title="July 16">July 16</a>, <a href="/wiki/1945.html" title="1945">1945</a>, near <a href="/wiki/Alamogordo.html" title="Alamogordo">Alamogordo</a>, <a href="/wiki/New_Mexico.html" title="New Mexico">New Mexico</a>, under the supervision of Grove's deputy Brig. Gen. <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Farrell.html" title="Thomas Farrell">Thomas Farrell</a>. This test was dubbed by Oppenheimer as "<a href="/wiki/Trinity_test.html" title="Trinity test">Trinity</a>".</p>

<h2>Similar efforts</h2>
<p>A similar effort was undertaken in the <a href="/wiki/Soviet_Union.html" title="Soviet Union">USSR</a> in September 1941 headed by <a href="/wiki/Igor_Kurchatov.html" title="Igor Kurchatov">Igor Kurchatov</a> (with a specific difference in that some of Kurchatov's World War II investigations came secondhand from Manhattan Project countries, thanks to spies, including at least two on the scientific team at Los Alamos, <a href="/wiki/Klaus_Fuchs.html" title="Klaus Fuchs">Klaus Fuchs</a> and <a href="/wiki/Theodore_Hall.html" title="Theodore Hall">Theodore Hall</a>, unknown to each other).</p>
<p>After the <a href="/wiki/MAUD_Committee.html" title="MAUD Committee">MAUD Committee</a>'s report, the British and Americans exchanged nuclear information, but initially did not pool their efforts. A separate British project, code-named <a href="/wiki/TUBE_ALLOYS.html" title="TUBE ALLOYS">TUBE ALLOYS</a>, was started but did not have American resources. Consequently the British bargaining position worsened and their motives were mistrusted by the Americans. Collaboration therefore lessened markedly until the <a href="/wiki/Quebec_Agreement.html" title="Quebec Agreement">Quebec Agreement</a> of August 1943, when a large team of British and Canadian scientists joined the Manhattan Project.</p>
<p>The question of Axis efforts on the bomb has always been an issue of contention. It is believed that token efforts in <a href="/wiki/Germany.html" title="Germany">Germany</a>, headed by <a href="/wiki/Werner_Heisenberg.html" title="Werner Heisenberg">Werner Heisenberg</a>, and in <a href="/wiki/Japanese_atomic_program.html" title="Japanese atomic program">Japan</a>, were also undertaken during the war but made little progress. It was initially feared that Hitler was very close to developing his own bomb. Many Nazi scientists in fact expressed surprise to their allied captors when the bombs were detonated in Japan; they had been convinced that talk of atomic weapons was merely propaganda. Incidentally <a href="/wiki/Niels_Bohr.html" title="Niels Bohr">Niels Bohr</a> and Heisenberg discussed the possibility of the atomic bomb prior to and during the war. Bohr had recalled that Heisenberg was unaware that the supercritical mass could be achieved with U-235. In fact, Bohr, Heisenberg and Fermi were all colleagues who were key figures in developing the quantum theory together with <a href="/wiki/Wolfgang_Pauli.html" title="Wolfgang Pauli">Wolfgang Pauli</a> prior to the war.</p>
<p>Together with the <a href="/wiki/Cryptography.html" title="Cryptography">cryptographic</a> efforts centered at <a href="/wiki/Bletchley_Park.html" title="Bletchley Park">Bletchley Park</a> and also at <a href="/wiki/Arlington_Hall.html" title="Arlington Hall">Arlington Hall</a>, the development of <a href="/wiki/Radar.html" title="Radar">radar</a> and <a href="/wiki/Computers.html" title="Computers">computers</a> in the UK and later in the USA, and the <a href="/wiki/Jet_engine.html" title="Jet engine">jet engine</a> in the UK and Germany, the Manhattan Project represents one of the few massive, secret, and outstandingly successful technological efforts spawned by the conflict of <a href="/wiki/World_War_II.html" title="World War II">World War II</a>.</p>
