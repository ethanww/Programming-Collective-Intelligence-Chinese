			<p>DSDM is a a <a href="/wiki/Framework.html" title="Framework">framework</a> based originally around <a href="/wiki/Rapid_application_development.html" title="Rapid application development">Rapid Application Development (RAD)</a>, supported by its continuous user involvement in an <a href="/wiki/Iterative_and_incremental_development.html" title="Iterative and incremental development">iterative development and incremental approach</a> which is responsive to changing requirements, in order to develop a system that meets the business needs on time and on budget. It is one of a number of <a href="/wiki/Agile_software_development.html" title="Agile software development">Agile methods</a> for developing software and forms part of the <a  class="new" title="Agile Alliance">Agile Alliance</a>.</p>
<p>DSDM was developed in the United Kingdom in the 1990s by a consortium of vendors and experts in the field of <a href="/wiki/Software_engineering.html" title="Software engineering">Information System (IS) development</a>, the DSDM Consortium, combining their <a href="/wiki/Best_practice.html" title="Best practice">best-practice</a> experiences. The DSDM Consortium is a non-profit and vendor independent organisation which owns and administers the framework. The first version was completed in January 1995 and published in February 1995. The current version in use at this point in time (April 2006) is Version 4.2: Framework for Business Centered Development released in May 2003.</p>
<p>DSDM Public Version 4.2 (<a  class="external text" title="http://www.dsdm.org">www.dsdm.org</a>) was made available for individuals to view and use in July 2006. However, anyone reselling DSDM must still be a member of the not-for-profit consortium.</p>
<p>As an extension of <a href="/wiki/Rapid_application_development.html" title="Rapid application development">rapid application development</a>, DSDM focuses on <a href="/wiki/Information_Systems.html" title="Information Systems">Information Systems</a> projects that are characterized by tight schedules and budgets. DSDM addresses the common reasons for information systems project failure including exceeding budgets, missing deadlines, and lack of user involvement and top management commitment.</p>
<p>DSDM consists of 3 <a  title="">phases</a>: pre-project phase, project life-cycle phase, and post project phase. The project life-cycle phase is subdivided into 5 stages: feasibility study, business study, functional model iteration, design and build iteration, and implementation.</p>
<p>DSDM recognizes that projects are limited by time and resources, and plans accordingly to meet the business needs. In order to achieve these goals, DSDM encourages the use of RAD with the consequent danger that too many corners are cut. DSDM applies some <a  title="">principles</a>, <a  title="">roles</a>, and <a  title="">techniques</a>.</p>
<p>In some circumstances, there are possibilities to integrate practices from other methodologies, such as <a href="/wiki/RUP.html" title="RUP">Rational Unified Process (RUP)</a>, <a href="/wiki/Extreme_Programming.html" title="Extreme Programming">Extreme Programming (XP)</a>, and <a href="/wiki/PRINCE2.html" title="PRINCE2">PRINCE2</a>, as complements to DSDM. Another agile method that has some similarity in process and concept to DSDM is <a href="/wiki/Scrum_%28management%29.html" title="Scrum (management)">Scrum</a>.</p>

<p><a name="Principles_of_DSDM" id="Principles_of_DSDM"></a></p>
<div id="principles">
<h2>Principles of DSDM</h2>
</div>
<p>There are 9 underlying principles of DSDM consisting of four foundations and five starting-points for the structure of the method. These principles form the cornerstones of development using DSDM.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>User involvement is the main key</b> in running an efficient and effective project, where both users and developers share a workplace, so that the decisions can be made accurately.</li>
<li><b>The project team must be empowered</b> to make decisions that are important to the progress of the project, without waiting for higher-level approval.</li>
<li>DSDM focuses on <b>frequent delivery of products</b>, with assumption that to deliver something "good enough" earlier is always better than to deliver everything "perfectly" in the end. By delivering product frequently from an early stage of the project, the product can be tested and reviewed where the test record and review document can be taken into account at the next iteration or phase.</li>
<li>The main criteria for acceptance of deliverable in DSDM is on <b>delivering a system that addresses the current business needs</b>. It is not so much directed at delivering a perfect system addressing all possible business needs, but focuses its efforts on critical functionality.</li>
<li><b>Development is iterative and incremental</b>, driven by users’ feedback to converge on an effective business solution.</li>
<li>All <b>changes</b> during the development <b>are reversible</b>.</li>
<li>The <b>high level scope and requirements should be base-lined</b> before the project starts.</li>
<li><b>Testing is carried out throughout the project life-cycle</b>. (See <a href="/wiki/Test-driven_development.html" title="Test-driven development">Test-driven development</a> for comparison).</li>
<li><b>Communication and cooperation among all project stakeholders</b> is required to be efficient and effective.</li>
</ul>
<p>DSDM is also supported by some other principles (or so called assumptions).</p>
<ul>
<li><b>No system is built perfectly in the first try</b> (the <a href="/wiki/80/20_rule.html" title="80/20 rule">pareto principle-80/20 rule</a>). In the process of developing an information system, 80% of the business benefit comes from 20% of the system requirements, therefore DSDM starts implementing this first 20% of system requirements to meet 80% of the business needs, which is good enough as long as the users are intimately involved in the development process and in a position to ensure that the missing 20% would not cause any serious business consequences. Implementing the entire requirements often causes the project to go over deadlines and budgets, therefore it is most times unnecessary to construct the perfect solution.</li>
<li><b>Project delivery should be on time, on budget and with good quality</b>.</li>
<li><b>DSDM only requires each step of the development to be completed far enough for the next step to begin</b>. This way a new iteration of the project can commence without having to wait for the previous to be completed entirely. And with every iteration the system is improved incrementally. Recall that the business requirements are changing over time at any rate.</li>
<li>Both <b>Project Management and Development techniques are incorporated</b> in DSDM.</li>
<li><b>DSDM can also be used in both in new projects and for expanding current systems</b>.</li>
<li><b>Risk assessment</b> should <b>focus on business function</b> being delivered, not on the construction process nor on development process artifacts (such as requirements and design documents).</li>
<li>Management rewards <b>product delivery rather than task completion</b>.</li>
<li><b>Estimation</b> should be <b>based on business functionality</b> instead of lines of code.</li>
</ul>

<p><a name="Prerequisites_for_using_DSDM" id="Prerequisites_for_using_DSDM"></a></p>
<div id="prerequisites">
<h2>Prerequisites for using DSDM</h2>
</div>
<p>In order for DSDM to be a success, a number of prerequisites need to be realized. First, there needs to be interactivity between the project team, future end users and higher management. This addresses well known failures of IS development projects due to lack of top management motivation and/or user involvement.</p>
<p>The second important prerequisite for DSDM projects is the decomposability of the project. The possibility of <a href="/wiki/Functional_decomposition.html" title="Functional decomposition">decomposition</a> into smaller parts enables the iterative approach, and activities, that are hard to prioritize, often causes delays. And that is exactly the effect that DSDM was developed to avoid. Another group of projects for which DSDM is not well-suited are safety-critical ones. The extensive testing and validation found in these kinds of projects collide with DSDM goals of being on time and on budget. Finally, projects that aim at re-usable components might not be well-suited for development using DSDM, because the demands on perfection are too high and collide with the 80%/20% principle <a  title="">described earlier</a>.</p>

<h2>The Phases of DSDM</h2>
</div>
<p>The DSDM framework consists of three sequential phases, namely the pre-project, project life-cycle and post-project phases. The project phase of DSDM is the most elaborate of the three phases. The project life-cycle phase consists of 5 stages that form an iterative step-by-step approach in developing an IS. The three phases and corresponding stages are explained extensively in the subsequent sections. For each stage/phase, the most important activities are addressed and the deliverables are mentioned.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Phase 1: The Pre-Project">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Phase_1:_The_Pre-Project" id="Phase_1:_The_Pre-Project"></a></p>
<h3>Phase 1: The Pre-Project</h3>
<p>In the pre-project phase candidate projects are identified, project funding is realized and project commitment is ensured. Handling these issues at an early stage avoids problems at later stages of the project.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Phase 2: The Project life-cycle">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Phase_2:_The_Project_life-cycle" id="Phase_2:_The_Project_life-cycle"></a></p>
<h3>Phase 2: The Project life-cycle</h3>
<p>The process overview in the figure above shows the project life-cycle of this phase of DSDM. It depicts the 5 stages a project will have to go through to create an IS. The first two stages, the Feasibility Study and Business Study are sequential phases that complement to each other. After these phases have been concluded, the system is developed iteratively and incrementally in the Functional Model Iteration, Design &amp; Build Iteration and Implementation stages. The iterative and incremental nature of DSDM will be addressed further in a later section.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Stage 1: The Feasibility Study">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Stage_1:_The_Feasibility_Study" id="Stage_1:_The_Feasibility_Study"></a></p>
<h4>Stage 1: The Feasibility Study</h4>
<p>During this stage of the project, the feasibility of the project for the use of DSDM is examined. <a  title="">Prerequisites</a> for the use of DSDM are addressed by answering questions like; ‘Can this project meet the required business needs?’, ‘Is this project suited for the use of DSDM?’ and ‘What are the most important risks involved?’. The most important techniques used in this phase are the <a  title="">Workshops</a> The deliverables for this stage are the Feasibility Report and the Feasibility Prototype that address the feasibility of the project at hand. It is extended with a global Outline Plan for the rest of the project and a Risk Log that identifies the most important risks for the project.</p>

<p><a name="Stage_2:_The_Business_Study" id="Stage_2:_The_Business_Study"></a></p>
<div id="businessstudy">
<h4>Stage 2: The Business Study</h4>
</div>
<p>The business study extends the <a href="/wiki/Feasibility_study.html" title="Feasibility study">feasibility study</a>. After the project has been deemed feasible for the use of DSDM, this stage examines the influenced business processes, user groups involved and their respective needs and wishes. Again the <a  title="">workshops</a> is one of the most valuable techniques, workshops in which the different stakeholders come together to discuss the proposed system. The information from these sessions is combined into a requirements list. An important property of the requirements list is the fact that the requirements are (can be) prioritized. These requirements are prioritized using the <a  title="">MoSCoW</a> approach. Based on this prioritization, a development plan is constructed as a guideline for the rest of the project. An important project technique used in the development of this plan is <a  title="">timeboxing</a>. This technique is essential in realizing the goals of DSDM, namely being on time and on budget, guaranteeing the desired quality. A <a href="/wiki/Software_architecture.html" title="Software architecture">system architecture</a> is another aid to guide the development of the IS.</p>
<p>The deliverables for this stage are a business area definition that describes the context of the project within the company, a system architecture definition that provides an initial global architecture of the IS under development together with a development plan that outlines the most important steps in the development process. At the base of these last two documents there is the prioritized requirements list. This list states all the requirements for the system, organized according to the <a  title="">MoSCoW</a> principle. And last the Risk Log is updated with the facts that have been identified during this phase of DSDM.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Stage 3: Functional Model Iteration">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Stage_3:_Functional_Model_Iteration" id="Stage_3:_Functional_Model_Iteration"></a></p>
<h4>Stage 3: Functional Model Iteration</h4>
<p>The requirements that have been identified in the previous stages are converted to a functional model. This model consists of both a functioning prototype and models. <a  title="">Prototyping</a> is one of the key project techniques within this stage that helps to realize good user involvement throughout the project. The developed prototype is reviewed by different user groups. In order to assure quality, <a  title="">testing</a> is implemented throughout every iteration of DSDM. An important part of testing is realized in the Functional Model Iteration. The Functional Model can be subdivided into four sub-stages:<br /></p>
<ul>
<li>Identify Functional Prototype: Determine the functionalities to be implemented in the prototype that results from this iteration.</li>
<li>Agree Schedule: Agree on how and when to develop these functionalities.</li>
<li>Create Functional Prototype: Develop the prototype. Investigate, refine, and consolidate it with the combined Functional prototype of previous iterations.</li>
<li>Review Prototype: Check the correctness of the developed prototype. This can be done via testing by end-user, then use the test records and user’s feedbacks to generate the functional prototyping review document.</li>
</ul>
<p><br />
The deliverables for this stage are a Functional Model and a Functional Prototype that together represent the functionalities that could be realized in this iteration, ready for testing by users. Next to this, the Requirements List is updated, deleting the items that have been realized and rethinking the prioritization of the remaining requirements. The Risk Log is also updated by having risk analysis of further development after reviewing the prototyping document.</p>

<h5>Process-data Diagram of Functional Model Iteration</h5>
<p>Identify functional prototype activity is to identify the functionalities that would be in the prototype of current iteration. Recall that both, analysis and coding are done; prototypes are built, and the experiences gained from them are used in improving the analysis models (based also on updated prioritized requirements list and updated risk log). The built prototypes are not to be entirely discarded, but gradually steered towards such quality that they can be included in the final system. Agree schedule is to determine when and how the prototyping will be implemented; it extends the scope to the available timetable and prototyping plan. And since testing is implemented throughout the whole process, it’s also an essential part of this phase, and therefore it is included in the Review Prototype activity right after the functional prototype is built and the test record will eventually be used in the review prototype process and generates the review document. Below is the process-data diagram of Functional Model Iteration stage.<br />

<p><a name="Stage_4:_Design_and_Build_Iteration" id="Stage_4:_Design_and_Build_Iteration"></a></p>
<h4>Stage 4: Design and Build Iteration</h4>
<p>The main focus of this DSDM iteration is to integrate the functional components from the previous phase into one system that satisfies user needs. It also addresses the non-functional requirements that have been set for the IS. Again <a  title="">testing</a> is an important ongoing activity in this stage. The Design and Build Iteration can be subdivided into four sub-stages:<br /></p>
<ul>
<li>Identify Design Prototype: Identify functional and non-functional requirements that need to be in the tested system.</li>
<li>Agree Schedule: Agree on how and when to realize these requirements.</li>
<li>Create Design Prototype: Create a system that can safely be handed to end-users for daily use. The investigate, refine, and consolidate the prototype of current iteration within prototyping process are also important in this sub-stage.</li>
<li>Review Design Prototype: Check the correctness of the designed system. Again testing and reviewing are the main techniques used, since the test records and user’s feedbacks are important to generate the user documentation.</li>
</ul>
<p><br />
The deliverables for this stage are a Design Prototype during the phase that end users get to test and at the end of the Design and Build Iteration the Tested System is handed over to the next phase. In this stage, the system is mainly built where the design and functions are consolidated and integrated in a prototype. Another deliverable for this stage is a User Documentation.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Stage 5: Implementation">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Stage_5:_Implementation" id="Stage_5:_Implementation"></a></p>
<h4>Stage 5: Implementation</h4>
<p>In the Implementation stage, the tested system including user documentation is delivered to the users and training of future users is realized. The system to be delivered has been reviewed to include the requirements that have been set in the beginning stages of the project. The Implementation stage can be subdivided into four sub-stages:<br /></p>
<ul>
<li>User Approval and Guidelines: End users approve the tested system for implementation and guidelines with respect to the implementation and use of the system are created.</li>
<li>Train Users: Train future end user in the use of the system.</li>
<li>Implement: Implement the tested system at the location of the end users.</li>
<li>Review Business: Review the impact of the implemented system on the business, a central issue will be whether the system meets the goals set at the beginning of the project. Depending on this the project goes to the next phase, the post-project or loops back to one of the preceding phases for further development.</li>
</ul>
<p><br />
The deliverables for this stage are a Delivered System on location, ready for use by the end users, Trained Users and detailed Project Review Document of the system.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Phase 3: Post-project">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Phase_3:_Post-project" id="Phase_3:_Post-project"></a></p>
<h3>Phase 3:</h3>
<div id="postproject">
<h3>Post-project</h3>
</div>
<p>The post-project phase ensures the system operating effectively and efficiently. This is realized by maintenance, enhancements and fixes according to DSDM principles. The maintenance can be viewed as continuing development based on the iterative and incremental nature of DSDM. Instead of finishing the project in one cycle usually the project can return to the previous phases or stages so that the previous step and the deliverable products can be refined.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Core Techniques of DSDM">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Core_Techniques_of_DSDM" id="Core_Techniques_of_DSDM"></a></p>
<div id="core">
<h2>Core Techniques of DSDM</h2>
</div>
<ul>
<li>
<div id="timeboxing"><b>Timeboxing</b></div>
Timeboxing is one of the project techniques of DSDM. It is used to support the main goals of DSDM to realize the development of an IS on time, within budget and with the desired quality. The main idea behind timeboxing is to split up the project in portions, each with a fixed budget and a delivery date. For each portion a number of requirements are selected that are prioritized according to the <a  title="">MoSCoW</a> principle. Because time and budget are fixed, the only remaining variables are the requirements. So if a project is running out of time or money the requirements with the lowest priority are omitted. This does not mean that an unfinished product is delivered, because of the <a href="/wiki/80/20_rule.html" title="80/20 rule">pareto</a> <a  title="">principle</a> that 80% of the project comes from 20% of the system requirements, so as long as those most important 20% of requirements are implemented into the system, the system therefore meets the business needs and that no system is built perfectly in the first try.</li>
<li>
<div id="moscow"><b>MoSCoW</b></div>
MoSCoW represents a way of prioritizing items. In the context of DSDM the MoSCoW technique is used to prioritize requirements. It is an acronym that stands for:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>MUST have this requirement to meet the business needs.</dd>
<dd>SHOULD have this requirement if at all possible, but the project success does not relay on this.</dd>
<dd>COULD have this requirement if it does not affect the fitness of business needs of the project.</dd>
<dd>WOULD have this requirement at later date if there is some time left (or in the future development of the system).<br /></dd>
<dd>(An elaborate explanation of the MoSCoW principle can be found <a href="/wiki/MoSCoW_Method.html" title="MoSCoW Method">here</a>.)</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>
<div id="prototyping"><b>Prototyping</b></div>
This technique refers to the creation of prototypes of the system under development at an early stage of the project. It enables the early discovery of shortcomings in the system and allows future users to ‘test-drive’ the system. This way good user involvement is realized, one of the key success factors of DSDM, or any System Development project for that matter.</li>
<li>
<div id="testing"><b>Testing</b></div>
A third important aspect of the goal of DSDM is the creation of an IS with good quality. In order to realize a solution of good quality, DSDM advocates testing throughout each iteration. Since DSDM is a tool and technique independent method, the project team is free to choose its own <a href="/wiki/Test_management_approach.html" title="Test management approach">test management method</a>, for example <a href="/wiki/Test_management_approach#Tmap_fundamentals.html" title="Test management approach">TMap</a>.</li>
<li>
<div id="workshop"><b>Workshop</b></div>
One of DSDM’s project techniques that aims at bringing the different stakeholders of the project together to discuss requirements, functionalities and mutual understanding. In a workshop the stakeholders come together and discuss the project.</li>
<li>
<div id="modelling"><b>Modelling</b></div>
This techique is essential and purposely used to visualise the diagrammatic representation of a specific aspect of the system or business area that is being developed. Modelling gives a better understanding for DSDM project team over a business domain.</li>
<li>
<div id="configuration"><b>Configuration Management</b></div>
A good implementation of this <a href="/wiki/Configuration_management.html" title="Configuration management">configuration management</a> technique is important for the dynamic nature of DSDM. Since there is more than one thing being handled at once during the development process of the system, and the products are being delivered frequently at a very fast rate, the products therefore need to be controlled strictly as they achieve (partial) completion.</li>
</ul>

<p><a name="Roles_of_DSDM" id="Roles_of_DSDM"></a></p>
<div id="roles">
<h2>Roles of DSDM</h2>
</div>
<p>There are some roles introduced within DSDM environment. It is important that the project members need to be appointed to different roles before they start to run the project. Each role has its own responsibility. The roles are:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Executive Sponsor</b> So called the “Project Champion”. An important role from the user organization who has the ability and responsibility to commit appropriate funds and resources. This role has an ultimate power to make decisions.</li>
<li><b>Visionary</b> The one who has the responsibility to initialize the project by ensuring that essential requirements are found early on. Visionary has the most accurate perception of the business objectives of the system and the project. Another task is to supervise and keep the development process in the right track.</li>
<li><b>Ambassador User</b> Brings the knowledge of user community into the project, ensures that the developers receive enough amount of user’s feedbacks during the development process.</li>
<li><b>Advisor User</b> Can be any user that represents an important viewpoint and brings the daily knowledge of the project.</li>
<li><b>Project Manager</b> Can be anyone from user community or IT staff who manages the project in general.</li>
<li><b>Technical Co-ordinator</b> Responsible in designing the system architecture and control the technical quality in the project.</li>
<li><b>Team Leader</b> Leads his team and ensures that the team works effectively as a whole.</li>
<li><b>Developer</b> Interprete the system requirements and model it including developing the deliverablecodes and build the prototypes.</li>
<li><b>Tester</b> Checks the correctness in a technical extents by performing some testings. Tester will have to give some comments and documentation.</li>
<li><b>Scribe</b> Responsible to gather and record the requirements, agreements, and decisions made in every workshop.</li>
<li><b>Facilitator</b> Responsible in managing the workshops progress, acts as a motor for preparation and communication.</li>
<li><b>Specialist Roles</b> Business Architect, Quality Manager, System Integrator, etc.</li>

<p><a name="Iterative_and_Incremental_Nature" id="Iterative_and_Incremental_Nature"></a></p>
<div id="iterative">
<h2>Iterative and Incremental Nature</h2>
</div>
<p>Next to <a  title="">timeboxing</a> and prioritizing of requirements, the DSDM also provides an <a href="/wiki/Iterative_and_incremental_development.html" title="Iterative and incremental development">iterative and incremental</a> approach to IS development. This can be seen in the figure depicting the Process Overview above. The Functional Model Iteration, Design &amp; Build Iteration and Implementation stages are all depicted in an iterative manner that shows that each of these stages can go over the different sub stages several times before entering the next stage. Every iteration addressing a set of new functionalities. Thanks to the incremental development approach every iteration is build on a functioning predecessor. And each increment can be turned back when/if needed. Next to this property, the figure also shows arrows going back to previous stages. For example, there is an arrow going back from Implementation to the Business Study. If a big functionality has been discovered during development that couldn’t be implemented, it might be possible to start all over by defining new requirements in a Business Study. Another example of stepping back to a previous stage is the arrow from Implementation to the Functional Model Iteration. This could be the case when functionality had to be omitted during the previous Functional Model Iteration, because of time and/or budget constraints. Only when all the requirements, needed to realize the set project and business goals, are met will the project proceed into the post-project phase. Because of the iterative nature of DSDM, it is essential to maintain good <a href="/wiki/Requirements_gathering.html" title="Requirements gathering">requirements management</a> and <a href="/wiki/Configuration_management.html" title="Configuration management">configuration management</a> in place throughout the entire project. This ensures that the project does implement the desired requirements in the desired fashion as was decided in the early <a  title="">phases</a> of the project.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Critical Success Factors of DSDM">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Critical_Success_Factors_of_DSDM" id="Critical_Success_Factors_of_DSDM"></a></p>
<h2>Critical Success Factors of DSDM</h2>
<p>Within DSDM a number of factors are identified as being of great importance to ensure successful projects. First there is the acceptance of DSDM by senior management and other employees. This ensures that the different actors of the project are motivated from the start and remain involved throughout the project. The second factor follows directly from this and that is the commitment of management to ensure end-user involvement. The prototyping approach requires a strong and dedicated involvement by end user to test and judge the functional prototypes. Then there is the project team. This team has to be composed of skillful members that form a stable union. An important issue is the empowerment of the project team. This means that the team (or one or more of his members) has to posses the power and possibility to make important decisions regarding the project without having to write formal proposals to higher management, which can be very time-consuming. In order for the project team to be able to run a successful project, they also need the right technology to conduct the project. This means a development environment, project management tools, etc. Finally DSDM also states that a supportive relationship between customer and vendor is required. This goes for both projects that are realized internally within companies or by outside contractors. An aid in ensuring a supporting relationship could be <a href="/wiki/ISPL.html" title="ISPL">ISPL</a>.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Meta-model (Meta-Modeling)">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Meta-model_.28Meta-Modeling.29" id="Meta-model_.28Meta-Modeling.29"></a></p>
<h2>Meta-model (Meta-Modeling)</h2>
<p>As explained in the Wikipedia item, <a href="/wiki/Meta-Modeling.html" title="Meta-Modeling">Meta-Modeling</a> takes a higher level look at methods and techniques. In doing so it offers possibilities for comparing similar methods and techniques and <a  class="new" title="Method Engineering">engineering</a> new methods from existing ones.</p>
<p>The Meta data model, depicted below, identifies the concepts and associations between these concepts within DSDM. As can be seen from the figure, two main concepts can be identified, namely the <i>Phase</i> and the <i>Flow</i> concept. Each <i>Flow</i> originates from a <i>Phase</i> within DSDM. Flows can be divided up in the sub concepts <i>Data</i> and <i>Product</i>. This subdivision is denoted with a <i>C</i>, which means that the subdivision is disjoint and complete. In other words, a <i>Flow</i> is always either a <i>Data Flow</i> or a <i>Product Flow</i>, but never both. In the situation of DSDM a <i>Data Flow</i> can be an arc returning to one of the preceding phases. <i>Product Flows are tangible goods that result from one of the</i> Phases <i>and are the input of the next</i> Phase<i>, for example reports and prototypes.</i></p>
<p>Then there is the second concept <i>Phase</i> that is also be divided two sub concepts with a complete and disjoint ordering. These sub concepts are the <i>Sequential</i> and the <i>Iterative Phases</i>. As was explained in an earlier section, DSDM starts with two sequential phases, The Feasibility and Business Study. Next a number of Iterative phases follow, i.e. Functional Model, Design &amp; Build and Implementation phases. The picture also mentions a number of rules and issues that are not included in the model, but that are important for this meta-model. First there are the rules that concerns the behavior of the ‘’Flows’’. These rules restrict the freedom of the flows so that they correspond to the ‘’Phase’’ transitions within DSDM. Next to the rules a number of important issues are addressed that ensure that the DSDM project life-cycle is guaranteed.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Comparison to other IS Development Methods">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Comparison_to_other_IS_Development_Methods" id="Comparison_to_other_IS_Development_Methods"></a></p>
<h2>Comparison to other IS Development Methods</h2>
<p>Over the years a great number of Information System Development methods have been developed and applied, divided in <a href="/wiki/SSADM.html" title="SSADM">Structured Methods</a>, <a href="/wiki/Rapid_application_development.html" title="Rapid application development">RAD methods</a> and <a href="/wiki/Object-oriented_programming.html" title="Object-oriented programming">Object-Oriented Methods</a>. Many of these methods show similarities to each other and also to DSDM. For example <a href="/wiki/Extreme_Programming.html" title="Extreme Programming">eXtreme Programming</a>, XP also has an <a  title="">iterative</a> approach to IS development with extensive user involvement.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Rational_Unified_Process.html" title="Rational Unified Process">Rational Unified Process</a> is a method that probably has the most in common with DSDM in that it is also a dynamic form of Information System Development. Again the <a  title="">iterative</a> approach is used in this development method.</p>
<p>Like XP and RUP there are many other development methods that show similarities to DSDM, but DSDM does distinguish itself from these methods in a number of ways. First there is the fact that it provides a tool and technique independent framework. This allows users to fill in the specific steps of the process with their own techniques and software aids of choice. Another unique feature is the fact that the variables in the development are not time/resources, but the requirements. This approach ensures the main goals of DSDM, namely to stay within the deadline and the budget. And last there is the strong focus on communication between and the involvement of all the stakeholders in the system. Although this is addressed in other methods, DSDM strongly believes in commitment to the project to ensure a successful outcome.</p>
