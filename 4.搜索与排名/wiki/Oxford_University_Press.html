<p><b>Oxford University Press</b> (<b>OUP</b>) is a highly-respected <a href="/wiki/Publisher.html" title="Publisher">publishing house</a> and a department of the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Oxford.html" title="University of Oxford">University of Oxford</a> in <a href="/wiki/England.html" title="England">England</a>.

OUP <a href="/wiki/USA.html" title="USA">USA</a>, established circa <a href="/wiki/1891.html" title="1891">1891</a> and incorporated in <a href="/wiki/1896.html" title="1896">1896</a>, is a <a href="/wiki/Private_limited_company.html" title="Private limited company">private limited company</a> affiliated to the parent body and was the Press's first international venture. The Indian Branch, set up in <a href="/wiki/1912.html" title="1912">1912</a>, was the second. OUP as a whole is managed by a body of elected representatives called the Delegates of the Press, who are all members of <a href="/wiki/Oxford_University.html" title="Oxford University">Oxford University</a>. Today it has two main imprints: Oxford University Press, under which the bulk of its reference, educational, and scholarly publications appear, and the Clarendon Press, which is its 'prestige' scholarly imprint. Most of the major branches function as local publishers as well as distribute and sell titles from OUP headquarters.</p>
<p>As a department of a <a href="/wiki/Charitable_organization.html" title="Charitable organization">charity</a>, OUP is exempt from income tax and corporate tax in most countries, but may pay sales and other commercial taxes on its products. The Press today transfers 30% of its annual surplus to the rest of the University, with a commitment to a minimum transfer of Â£12 million per annum. OUP is the largest <a href="/wiki/University_press.html" title="University press">university press</a> in the world by the number of publications, publishing more than 4,500 new books every year and employing some 4,000 people. OUP publishes many reference, professional, and academic works including the <i><a href="/wiki/Oxford_English_Dictionary.html" title="Oxford English Dictionary">Oxford English Dictionary</a></i>, the <i><a href="/wiki/Concise_Oxford_English_Dictionary.html" title="Concise Oxford English Dictionary">Concise Oxford English Dictionary</a></i>, the <a href="/wiki/Oxford_World%27s_Classics.html" title="Oxford World's Classics">Oxford World's Classics</a> and the <i><a href="/wiki/Dictionary_of_National_Biography.html" title="Dictionary of National Biography">Oxford Dictionary of National Biography</a></i>. A number of its most important titles are now available electronically in a package called "Oxford Reference Online", and are offered free to holders of a reader's card from many public libraries in the UK.</p>
<p>In 2003, OUP acquired from <a href="/wiki/Macmillan_Publishers.html" title="Macmillan Publishers">Macmillan Publishers</a> the <i><a href="/wiki/Grove_Dictionary_of_Music_and_Musicians.html" title="Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians">Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians</a></i> and the <i><a  class="new" title="Dictionary of Art">Dictionary of Art</a></i>. Of late, the Press has been acquiring specialty publishers such as <a href="/wiki/Oceana_Publications.html" title="Oceana Publications">Oceana Publications</a>. <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.oceanalaw.com/pdf/Oxford%20Press%20Release%20PDF.pdf">[1]</a> Unfortunately, some years ago it also closed down the much-loved <a  class="new" title="Oxford Poets">Oxford Poets</a> series.</p>
<p>Books published by Oxford have <a href="/wiki/ISBN.html" title="ISBN">International Standard Book Numbers</a> that begin with 0-19, making the Press one of a tiny number of publishers who have two-digit identification numbers in the ISBN system.</p>

<h2>Early History</h2>
<p><a href="/wiki/William_Caxton.html" title="William Caxton">William Caxton</a> established the first printing press in <a href="/wiki/England.html" title="England">England</a> in <a href="/wiki/1476.html" title="1476">1476</a>, following the invention of the <a href="/wiki/Printing_press.html" title="Printing press">printing press</a> by <a href="/wiki/Johann_Gutenberg.html" title="Johann Gutenberg">Johann Gutenberg</a> in <a href="/wiki/1450.html" title="1450">1450</a> and the subsequent spread of the technology across <a href="/wiki/Europe.html" title="Europe">Europe</a>. Two years later, in <a href="/wiki/1478.html" title="1478">1478</a>, the first book was printed in the city of <a href="/wiki/Oxford.html" title="Oxford">Oxford</a>. This book caused something of a sensation among later historians as it carried the erroneous date of <a href="/wiki/1468.html" title="1468">1468</a>, which would have placed it before Caxton in time. However its printing was only tenuously related to the existence of the university. For the next hundred years, books used by or produced for the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Oxford.html" title="University of Oxford">University of Oxford</a> would be printed by a succession of local independent printers.</p>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/1586.html" title="1586">1586</a> a decree from the <a href="/wiki/Star_Chamber.html" title="Star Chamber">Star Chamber</a> granted the privilege to print books to an Oxford printer who claimed to have the favour of the university; this was at that time the only such license issued to a press outside London. <a href="/wiki/Charles_I_of_England.html" title="Charles I of England">King Charles I</a> increased the independence and latitude of the University Press when he entitled the University to print "all manner of books" by granting a <a href="/wiki/Great_Charter.html" title="Great Charter">Great Charter</a> to the University in <a href="/wiki/1632.html" title="1632">1632</a> (The <a href="/wiki/University_of_Cambridge.html" title="University of Cambridge">University of Cambridge</a> received a similar charter at the same time.) The content of the charter was negotiated by <a href="/wiki/Archbishop_Laud.html" title="Archbishop Laud">Archbishop Laud</a>, at the time Chancellor of the University, as part of his drive to establish a set of statutes (the Laudian Code) that were to govern the running of the University for the next two centuries.</p>
<p>Delegates of the Press were briskly appointed from among the fellows of the university in <a href="/wiki/1633.html" title="1633">1633</a> to oversee the matters of this still theoretical entity, but in the absence of an actual press to print books on, the licence languished for a few more years. The Delegates appear to have met in 1668, but the lack of capital and enterprise stayed their hand and in <a href="/wiki/1672.html" title="1672">1672</a> the charismatic <a href="/wiki/John_Fell.html" title="John Fell">John Fell</a>, <a href="/wiki/Dean_%28religion%29.html" title="Dean (religion)">Dean</a> of <a href="/wiki/Christ_Church.html" title="Christ Church">Christ Church</a> and <a href="/wiki/Bishop.html" title="Bishop">Bishop</a> of Oxford, leased the university's licence to print. Fell set about collecting sets of exotic and rare <a href="/wiki/Fonts.html" title="Fonts">type founts</a> in <a href="/wiki/Hebrew.html" title="Hebrew">Hebrew</a>, <a href="/wiki/Greek_Language.html" title="Greek Language">Greek</a> and other classical languages for his learned press which he housed on somewhat dubious authority in the environs of the <a href="/wiki/Sheldonian_Theatre.html" title="Sheldonian Theatre">Sheldonian Theatre</a> off Broad Way in Oxford. On his death in <a href="/wiki/1690.html" title="1690">1690</a> the press and its <a  class="new" title="Press furniture">furniture</a> passed to the university, and with this there was at last the physical wherwithal to act on the charter to print books.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a  title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Pressâs initial fortunes were made on the publication in <a href="/wiki/1702.html" title="1702">1702</a> of the hugely popular (but historiographically suspect) <i><a  class="new" title="History of the Great Rebellion">History of the Great Rebellion</a></i> by the <a href="/wiki/Earl_of_Clarendon.html" title="Earl of Clarendon">Earl of Clarendon</a> that charted the progress of the <a href="/wiki/English_Civil_War.html" title="English Civil War">English Civil War</a> and <a href="/wiki/Oliver_Cromwell.html" title="Oliver Cromwell">Oliver Cromwell</a>âs rule of the country, and the proceeds went to build the Press a permanent home, Clarendon House. Clarendonâs name, too, came over time to be used, to the puzzlement of outsiders, for a variety of imprints and titles produced by the Press. The Press thus initially developed with two parts: the Learned (Clarendon) Press producing titles by scholars, and the <a href="/wiki/Bible.html" title="Bible">Bible</a> Press, which was set up circa 1690 to print the <a href="/wiki/Authorised_Version.html" title="Authorised Version">King James Bible</a> first issued in <a href="/wiki/1611.html" title="1611">1611</a>. The licence to print Bibles had been granted on paper to the King's Printers in London and by the two universities of Oxford and Cambridge. However, the Delegates of the Press at Oxford University soon found that catering to the enormous demand for Bibles was too exhausting for a group of scholars donating voluntary labour, and the privilege was leased out. In <a href="/wiki/1780.html" title="1780">1780</a>, the bottom having fallen out of the American Bible market due to the <a href="/wiki/American_War_of_Independence.html" title="American War of Independence">American War of Independence</a> of <a href="/wiki/1775.html" title="1775">1775</a>, the Delegates of the Press created forty two shares in the Bible privilege and farmed them out to a set of commercial printers in London. Much permutation and combination followed as the shares were subdivided and inherited by this motley crew, until in the 1880s the shares were once again brought under the university's control.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a  title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Reorganisation in the Nineteenth Century">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Reorganisation_in_the_Nineteenth_Century" id="Reorganisation_in_the_Nineteenth_Century"></a></p>
<h2>Reorganisation in the Nineteenth Century</h2>
<p>From the <a href="/wiki/1850.html" title="1850">1850s</a> onward the University of Oxford underwent a protracted and painful programme of modernisation, under the aegis of <a href="/wiki/William_Gladstone.html" title="William Gladstone">William Gladstone</a> among others. The Delegacy of the Press ceased to be âperpetualâ in <a href="/wiki/1856.html" title="1856">1856</a>. It now had five perpetual and five junior posts filled by appointment from the University, with the <a href="/wiki/Vice_Chancellor.html" title="Vice Chancellor">Vice Chancellor</a> a Delegate ex officio.</p>
<p>As the reform of the University got under way, the Delegates were split into two groups. One, epitomized by <a href="/wiki/Mark_Pattison.html" title="Mark Pattison">Mark Pattison</a>, a <a href="/wiki/Classicist.html" title="Classicist">classicist</a> whom <a  class="new" title="Mrs Humphrey Ward">Mrs Humphrey Ward</a> once described as looking âlike a discontented lizard with a coldâ,<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a  title="">[3]</a></sup> believed scholarship was the sole purpose for the Pressâs existence; the other, that of <a href="/wiki/Benjamin_Jowett.html" title="Benjamin Jowett">Benjamin Jowett</a>, saw it first as a commercial venture intended to sponsor the Universityâs scholarly pursuits through selling books which the public were ready and willing to buy for hard cash. What was needed was a happy mean between these two, but the nature of the politics and the personalities involved meant that a <a href="/wiki/Manichaean.html" title="Manichaean">Manichaean</a> opposition was perceived and fought out between the two camps in true epic style. <sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a  title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>The reformist group's first step was to appoint a <a href="/wiki/London.html" title="London">London</a> agent to act for them in the business of selling books. <a  class="new" title="John Murray III">John Murray III</a> declined, but <a href="/wiki/Alexander_Macmillan.html" title="Alexander Macmillan">Alexander Macmillan</a>, who had just moved to London from <a href="/wiki/Cambridge.html" title="Cambridge">Cambridge</a>, agreed eagerly and was appointed around <a href="/wiki/1863.html" title="1863">1863</a>. <a href="/wiki/Macmillan.html" title="Macmillan">Macmillan</a> and <a href="/wiki/Bartholomew_Price.html" title="Bartholomew Price">Bartholomew Price</a> began between them to concoct a scheme to be known as the Clarendon Press series, a collection of schoolbooks meant to be cheap, elementary and profitable. This appears to have been thefirst major use of 'Clarendon' as an imprint, a surprising start to the style that became the Pressâs prestige scholarly flagship.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a  title="">[5]</a></sup> Macmillan allowed the Press to take up the proposed New English Dictionary from the Philological Society, a prospective white elephant he did not regret, and he in turn got <a href="/wiki/Charles_Lutwidge_Dodgson.html" title="Charles Lutwidge Dodgson">Charles Lutwidge Dodgson</a> (<a href="/wiki/Lewis_Carroll.html" title="Lewis Carroll">Lewis Carroll</a>). The <a href="/wiki/New_English_Dictionary.html" title="New English Dictionary">New English Dictionary</a> under the editorship of <a href="/wiki/James_Murray.html" title="James Murray">James Murray</a> finally appeared as the <a href="/wiki/Oxford_English_Dictionary.html" title="Oxford English Dictionary">Oxford English Dictionary</a>, completed after much struggle in 1910, now the foundation of OUPâs fortunes.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a  title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>The greatly enhanced volume of business produced by the Macmillan agency began to put pressure on the Oxford administration. <a  class="new" title="G.W. Kitchin">G.W. Kitchin</a>, Secretary of both the School Book Committee and of the Board of Delegates as a whole, had no taste for the routine of office, and in 1868 he stepped down in favour of Bartholomew Price. Price declared that he was not to be the Delegatesâ clerk but their executive officer, and all the heads of the various departments, the Printing Works, the Bible Warehouse, the bindery and the <a href="/wiki/Wolvercote.html" title="Wolvercote">Wolvercote</a> paper mill, were to report directly to him. He quickly acquired a reputation for moderation and level-headedness and had a knack for settling debate with a few well-chosen words. Factions had no effect on him, and even Mark Pattison, who was constitutionally disposed to dislike everybody, found him tolerable.</p>
<p>The association with Macmillan ended in 1880. This was part of Priceâs master plan to end all outside influence, including the Bible partnership, and bring all aspects of the Pressâs business more directly under the administration of the Delegates. He cast about for a suitable replacement and soon heard through the Bible trade grapevine that the contract of <a  class="new" title="Henry Frowde">Henry Frowde</a>, the young assistant to a trader named Mr Stock, was about to expire, and that Frowde was looking for other employment. Stock in fact did business in the name of âHenry Frowdeâ, so by the time Frowde came to the Delegates his name carried valuable goodwill in the Bible trade. Price dropped hints in the right places and on <a href="/wiki/February_5.html" title="February 5">5 February</a> <a href="/wiki/1874.html" title="1874">1874</a> Frowde wrote requesting to see him.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a  title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: The London Business">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="The_London_Business" id="The_London_Business"></a></p>
<h3>The London Business</h3>
<p>Frowde had no doubt that the Pressâs business in London could be very largely increased and was appointed on contract with a commission on sales. Seven years later, as Publisher to the University, Frowde was using his own name as an imprint as well as 'Oxford University Press'. This style persisted till recent times, with two kinds of imprints emenating from the Press's London offices. The last man to be known as âPublisher to the Universityâ was John Brown, known to his colleagues as âBrunoâ.</p>
<p>The distinctions implied by the imprints were subtle but important. Books which were issued by London on commission (paid for by their authors of by some learned body) were styled âHenry Frowdeâ, or âHumphrey Milfordâ with no mention of OUP, as if the Publisher were issuing them himself, while books that the Publisher issued under the rubric of the University bore the imprint âOxford University Pressâ. Both these categories were mostly handled by London, while Oxford (in practice the Secretary) looked after the Clarendon Press books. Commission books were intended to be cash cows to fund the London Businessâs overheads, since the Press did not lay aside any resources for this purpose. Nevertheless Frowde was especially careful to see that all commission books he published met with the Delegates' approval. This was not an uncommon arrangement for <a  class="new" title="Scholarly presses">scholarly</a> or <a  class="new" title="Antiquarian presses">antiquarian presses</a>.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a  title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>Price quickly primed Frowde for the imminent publication jointly with Cambridge University Press of the <a  class="new" title="Revised Version of the Bible">Revised Version of the Bible</a>, which promised to be a â<a href="/wiki/Bestseller.html" title="Bestseller">bestseller</a>â on a scale that would require the employment of all the Pressâs resources to keep up with the demand. This was to be a complete retranslation of the text of the Bible from the oldest original Greek and Hebrew versions, superseding the <a href="/wiki/Authorized_Version.html" title="Authorized Version">Authorized Version</a> of <a href="/wiki/1611.html" title="1611">1611</a>. Frowdeâs agency was set up just in time, for the Revised Version, published on 17 May 1881, sold a million copies before publication and at a breakneck rate thenceforth, though overproduction ultimately made a dent in the profits.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a  title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p>Though Frowde was by no means an Oxford man and had no social pretensions of being one, he was a sound businessman who was able to strike the magic balance between caution and enterprise. From quite early on he had ideas of advancing the Pressâs overseas trade, at first in Europe and increasingly in America, Canada, India and Africa. He was more or less singlehandedly responsible for setting up the American Branch as well as depots in <a href="/wiki/Edinburgh.html" title="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a>, <a href="/wiki/Toronto.html" title="Toronto">Toronto</a> and <a href="/wiki/Melbourne.html" title="Melbourne">Melbourne</a>. Frowde dealt with most of the logistics for books carrying the OUP imprint, including handling authors, binding, dispatching, and advertizing, and only editorial work and the printing itself were carried out at or supervised from Oxford.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a  title="">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p>Frowde regularly remitted money back to Oxford, but he privately felt that the business was undercapitalized and would pretty soon become a serious drain on the university's resources unless put on a sound commercial footing. He himself was authorized to invest money up to a limit in the business but was prevented from doing so by family troubles. Hence his interest in overseas sales, for by the 1880s and 1890s there was money to be made in India, while the European book market was in the doldrums. But Frowdeâs distance from the Pressâs decision-making meant he was incapable of influencing policy unless a Delegate spoke for him. Most of the time Frowde did whatever he could within the mandate given him by the Delegates. In <a href="/wiki/1905.html" title="1905">1905</a> when applying for a pension he wrote to <a  class="new" title="J.R. Magrath">J.R. Magrath</a>, the then Vice Chancellor, that during the seven years when he had served as manager of the Bible Warehouse the sales of the London Business had averaged about Â£20,000 and the profits Â£1,887 per year. By 1905, under his management as Publisher, the sales had risen to upwards of Â£200,000 per year and the profits in that 29 years of service averaged Â£8,242 per year.</p>

<h3>Conflict Over the Secretaryship</h3>
<p>Price, trying in his own way to modernize the Press against the resistance of its own historical inertia, had become overworked and by <a href="/wiki/1883.html" title="1883">1883</a> was so exhausted as to want to retire. Benjamin Jowett had become Vice Chancellor of the University in <a href="/wiki/1882.html" title="1882">1882</a>. Impatient of the endless committees that would no doubt attend the appointment of a successor to Price, Jowett extracted what could be interpreted as permission from the Delegates and headhunted <a  class="new" title="Philip Lyttelton Gell">Philip Lyttelton Gell</a>, a former student acolyte of his, to be the next Secretary to the Delegates. Gell was making a name for himself at the publishing firm of <a  class="new" title="Cassell, Petter and Galpin">Cassell, Petter and Galpin</a>, a firm regarded as scandalously commercial by the Delegates. Gell himself was a patrician who was unhappy with his work, where he saw himself as catering to the taste of 'one class: the lower middle', and he grasped at the chance of working with the kind of texts and readerships OUP attracted.</p>
<p>Jowett promised Gell golden opportunities, little of which he actually had the authority to deliver. He timed Gellâs appointment to coincide with both the Long Vacation (from June to September) and the death of Mark Pattison, so potential opposition was prevented from attending the crucial meetings. Jowett knew the primary reason why Gell would attract hostility was that he had never worked for the Press nor been a Delegate, and he had sullied himself in the City with raw commerce. His fears were borne out. Gell immediately proposed a thorough modernising of the Press with a marked lack of tact, and earned himself enduring enemies. Nevertheless he was able to do a lot in tandem with Frowde, and expanded the publishing programmes and the reach of OUP until about 1898. Then his health broke down under the impossible work conditions he was being forced to endure by the Delegates' non-cooperation. The Delegates then served him with a notice of termination of service that violated his contract. However, he was persuaded not to file suit and to go quietly.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a  title="">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Delegates were not opposed primarily to his initiatives, but to his manner of executing them and his lack of sympathy with the academic way of life. In their view the Press was, and always would be, an association of scholars. Gell's idea of âefficiencyâ appeared to violate that culture, although subsequently a very similar programme of reform was put into practice from the inside.</p>

<h2>The Twentieth Century</h2>
<p><a  class="new" title="Charles Cannan">Charles Cannan</a>, who had been instrumental in Gell's removal, succeeded Gell in <a href="/wiki/1900.html" title="1900">1900</a>, and <a  class="new" title="Humphrey S. Milford">Humphrey S. Milford</a>, his younger colleague, effectively succeeded Frowde in 1907. Both were Oxford men who knew the system inside out, and the close collaboration with which they worked was a function of their shared background and worldview. Cannan was known for terrifying silences, and Milford had an uncanny ability, testified to by Amen House employees, to âdisappearâ in a room rather like a <a href="/wiki/Cheshire_cat.html" title="Cheshire cat">Cheshire cat</a>, from which obscurity he would suddenly address his subordinates and make them jump. Whatever their reasons for their style of working, both Cannan and Milford had a very hardnosed view of what needed to be done, and they proceeded to do it. Indeed Frowde knew within a few weeks of Milfordâs entering the London office in [1904] that he would be replaced. Milford, however, always treated Frowde with courtesy, and Frowde remained in an advisory capacity till <a href="/wiki/1913.html" title="1913">1913</a>. Milford rapidly teamed up with <a  class="new" title="J.E. Hodder Williams">J.E.

Milford began putting in practice a number of initiatives, including the foundations of most of the Pressâs global branches.</p>

<h3>Development of Overseas Trade</h3>
<p>Milford took responsibility for overseas trade almost at once, and by <a href="/wiki/1906.html" title="1906">1906</a> he was making plans to send a traveller to India and the Far East jointly with Hodder and Stoughton. N. Graydon (first name unknown) was the first such traveller in <a href="/wiki/1907.html" title="1907">1907</a>, and again in <a href="/wiki/1908.html" title="1908">1908</a> when he represented OUP exclusively in India, the Straits and the Far East. A.H. Cobb replaced him in <a href="/wiki/1909.html" title="1909">1909</a>, and in <a href="/wiki/1910.html" title="1910">1910</a> Cobb functioned as a travelling manager semi-permanently stationed in India. In <a href="/wiki/1911.html" title="1911">1911</a> <a href="/wiki/E.V._Rieu.html" title="E.V. Rieu">E.V. Rieu</a> went out to <a href="/wiki/East_Asia.html" title="East Asia">East Asia</a> via the <a href="/wiki/Trans-Siberian_Railway.html" title="Trans-Siberian Railway">Trans-Siberian Railway</a>, had several adventures in <a href="/wiki/China.html" title="China">China</a> and <a href="/wiki/Russia.html" title="Russia">Russia</a>, then came south to India and spent most of the year meeting educationists and officials all over India. In <a href="/wiki/1912.html" title="1912">1912</a>, he arrived again in <a href="/wiki/Mumbai.html" title="Mumbai">Bombay</a>, now known as Mumbai. There he rented an office in the dockside area and set up the first overseas Branch.</p>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/1914.html" title="1914">1914</a> <a href="/wiki/Europe.html" title="Europe">Europe</a> was plunged into turmoil. The first effects of the war were paper shortages and losses and disturbances in shipping, then quickly a dire lack of hands as the staff were called up and went to serve on the field. Many of the staff including two of the pioneers of the Indian branch were killed in action. Curiously, sales through the years 1914 to <a href="/wiki/1917.html" title="1917">1917</a> were good and it was only towards the end of the war that conditions really began pinching.</p>
<p>Rather than bringing relief from shortages the <a href="/wiki/1920.html" title="1920">1920s</a> saw skyrocketing prices of both materials and labour. Paper especially was hard to come by and had to be imported from South America through trading companies. Economies and markets slowly recovered as the 1920s progressed. In 1928 the Pressâs imprint read âLondon, Edinburgh, <a href="/wiki/Glasgow.html" title="Glasgow">Glasgow</a>, <a href="/wiki/Leipzig.html" title="Leipzig">Leipzig</a>, Toronto, Melbourne, <a href="/wiki/Capetown.html" title="Capetown">Capetown</a>, Bombay, <a href="/wiki/Calcutta.html" title="Calcutta">Calcutta</a>, <a href="/wiki/Madras.html" title="Madras">Madras</a> and Shanghaiâ. Not all of these were full-fledged branches: in Leipzig there was a depot run by H. Bohun Beet, and In Canada and Australia there were small, functional depots in the cities and an army of educational representatives penetrating the rural fastnesses to sell the Pressâs stock as well as books published by firms whose agencies were held by the Press, very often including fiction and light reading. In India, the Branch depots in Bombay, Madras, and Calcutta were imposing establishments with sizable stock inventories, for the Presidencies themselves were large markets, and the educational representatives there dealt mostly with upcountry trade. The Depression of 1929 dried profits from the Americas to a trickle, and India became 'the one bright spot' in an otherwise dismal picture. Bombay was the nodal point for distribution to the africas and onward sale to Australasia, and people who trained at the three major depots moved later on to pioneer branches in Africa and South East Asia.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a  title="">[12]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Pressâs experience of <a href="/wiki/World_War_II.html" title="World War II">World War II</a> was similar to <a href="/wiki/World_War_I.html" title="World War I">World War I</a> except that Milford was now close to retirement and âhated to see the young men goâ. The <a href="/wiki/The_Blitz.html" title="The Blitz">London blitz</a> this time was much more intense and the London Business was shifted temporarily to Oxford. Milford, now extremely unwell and reeling under a series of personal bereavements, was prevailed upon to stay till the end of the war and keep the business going. As before, everything was in short supply, but the U-boat threat made shipping doubly uncertain, and the letterbooks are full of doleful records of consignments lost at sea. Occasionally an author, too, would be reported missing or dead, as well as staff who were now scattered over the battledfields of the globe. DORA, the <a href="/wiki/Defense_of_the_Realm_Act.html" title="Defense of the Realm Act">Defense of the Realm Act</a> required the surrender of all nonessential metal for the manufacture of armaments, and many valuable <a  class="new" title="Electrotype">electrotype</a> plates were melted down by government order.</p>
<p>With the end of the war Milford's place was taken by Geoffrey Cumberlege. This period saw consolidation in the face of the breakup of the Empire and the post-war reorganisation of the so-called Commonwealth. In tandem with institutions like the British Council, OUP began to reposition itself in the education market. Ngugi wa Thiongo in his book <i>Moving the Centre: The Struggle for Cultural Freedom</i> records how the Oxford Readers for Africa with their heavily Anglo-centric worldview struck him as a child in Kenya.<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a  title="">[13]</a></sup> The Press has evolved since then to be one of the largest players in a globally expanding scholarly and reference book market.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: The Indian Branch">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="The_Indian_Branch" id="The_Indian_Branch"></a></p>
<h4>The Indian Branch</h4>
<p>When OUP arrived on Indian shores, it was preceded by the immense prestige of the <a href="/wiki/Sacred_Books_of_the_East.html" title="Sacred Books of the East">Sacred Books of the East</a>, edited by <a href="/wiki/Friedrich_Max_M%C3%BCller.html" title="Friedrich Max MÃ¼ller">Friedrich Max MÃ¼ller</a>, which had at last reached completion in 50 ponderous volumes. While actual purchase of this series was beyond most Indians, libraries usually had a set, generously provided by the government of India, available on open reference shelves, and the books had been widely discussed in the Indian media. Although there had been plenty of criticism of them, the general feeling was that Max Muller had done India a favour by popularising ancient Asian (<a href="/wiki/Persia.html" title="Persia">Persian</a>, <a href="/wiki/Arabia.html" title="Arabia">Arabic</a>, <a href="/wiki/India.html" title="India">Indian</a> and <a href="/wiki/China.html" title="China">Sinic</a>) philosophy in the West.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a  title="">[14]</a></sup></p>
<p>This prior reputation was useful, but the Indian Branch was not primarily in Bombay to sell Indological books, which OUP knew from prior experience sold well only in America. It was there to serve the vast educational market created by the rapidly expanding school and college network in British India. In spite of disruptions cause by war, it won a crucial contract to print textbooks for the <a href="/wiki/Madhya_Pradesh.html" title="Madhya Pradesh">Central Provinces</a> in <a href="/wiki/1915.html" title="1915">1915</a> and this helped to stabilise its fortunes in this difficult phase. Rieu could not longer delay his callup and was drafted in <a href="/wiki/1917.html" title="1917">1917</a>, the management now being under his wife <a  class="new" title="Nellie Rieu">Nellie Rieu</a>, a former editor for the <i><a href="/wiki/Athenaeum.html" title="Athenaeum">Athenaeum</a></i> âwith the assistance of her two British babies.â It was too late to have important electrotype and stereotype plates shipped to India from Oxford, and the Oxford printing house itself was overburdened with government printing orders as the empireâs propaganda machine got to work. At one point non-governmental composition at Oxford was reduced to 32 pages a week.</p>
<p>By <a href="/wiki/1919.html" title="1919">1919</a> Rieu was very ill and had to be brought home. He was replaced by <a  class="new" title="Geoffrey Cumberlege">Geoffrey Cumberlege</a> and <a  class="new" title="Noel Carrington">Noel Carrington</a>. Noel was the brother of <a href="/wiki/Dora_Carrington.html" title="Dora Carrington">Dora Carrington</a>, the artist, and even got her to illustrate his Stories Retold edition of <i><a href="/wiki/Don_Quixote.html" title="Don Quixote">Don Quixote</a></i> for the Indian market. Their father Charles Carrington had been a railway engineer in India in the nineteenth century. Noel Carrington's unpublished memoir of his six years in India is in the <a href="/wiki/Oriental_and_India_Office_Collections.html" title="Oriental and India Office Collections">Oriental and India Office Collections</a> of the <a href="/wiki/British_Library.html" title="British Library">British Library</a>.</p>
<p>By 1915 there were makeshift depots at Madras and Calcutta. In 1920 Noel Carrington went to Calcutta to set up a proper branch. There he became friendly with <a href="/wiki/Edward_Thompson.html" title="Edward Thompson">Edward Thompson</a> who involved him in the abortive scheme to produce the 'Oxford Book of Bengali Verse'. <sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a  title="">[15]</a></sup> In Madras, there was never a formal branch in the same sense as Bombay and Calcutta, as the management of the depot there seems to have rested in the hands of two local academics.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: East and South East Asia">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="East_and_South_East_Asia" id="East_and_South_East_Asia"></a></p>
<h4>East and South East Asia</h4>
<p>OUP's interaction with this area was part of their mission to India, since many of their travellers took in East and South East Asia on their way out to or back from India. Graydon on his first trip in 1907 had travelled the 'Straits Settlements' (largely the Federated Malay States and Singapore), China, and Japan, but was not able to do much. In 1909 A. H. Cobb visited teachers and booksellers in Shanghai, and found that the main competition there was cheap books from America, often straight reprints of British books.<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a  title="">[16]</a></sup>. The copyright situation at the time, subsequent to the Chace Act of <a href="/wiki/1891.html" title="1891">1891</a>, was such that American publishers could publish such books with impunity although they were considered contraband in all British territories. To secure copyright in both territories publishers had to arrange for simultaneous publication, an endless logistical headache in this age of steamships. Prior publication in any one territory forfeited copyright protection in the other.<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a  title="">[17]</a></sup></p>
<p>Cobb mandated Henzell &amp; Co. of Shanghai (which seems to have been run by a professor) to represent OUP in that city. <sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a  title="">[18]</a></sup> The Press had problems with Henzell, who were irregular with correspondence. They also traded with Edward Evans, another Shanghai bookseller. Milford observed, âwe ought to do much more in China than we are doingâ and authorized Cobb in <a href="/wiki/1910.html" title="1910">1910</a> to find a replacement for Henzell as their representative to the educational authorities.<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a  title="">[19]</a></sup> That replacement was to be Miss M. Verne McNeely, a redoubtable lady who was a member of the <a href="/wiki/SPCK.html" title="SPCK">Society for the Propagation of Christian Knowledge</a>, and also ran a bookshop. She looked after the affairs of the Press very capably and occasionally sent Milford boxes of complimentary cigars. Her association with OUP seems to date from 1910, although she did not have exclusive agency for OUP's books. Bibles were the major item of trade in China, unlike India where educational books topped the lists, even if Oxford's lavishly produced and expensive Bible editions were not very competitive beside cheap American ones.</p>
<p>In the 1920s, once the Indian Branch was up and running, it became the custom for staff members going outor returning to take a tour of East and South East Asia. MIlford's nephew R. Christopher Bradby went out in 1928. He returned to Britan just in time, for on 18 October 1931 the Japanese invaded northeast China. Soon the entire country had been overrun. Miss M. Verne McNeely wrote a letter of protest to the League of Nations and one of despair to Milford, who tried to comfort her. <sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a  title="">[20]</a></sup></p>
<p>Japan was a much less well-known market to OUP, and a small volume of trade was carried out largely through intermediaries. The Maruzen company was by far the largest customer, and had a special arrangement regarding terms. Other business was routed through H.L. Griffiths, a professional publishersâ representative based in Sannomiya, Kobe. Griffiths travelled for the Press to major Japanese schools and bookshops and took a 10 percent commission. Edmund Blunden had been briefly at the University of Tokyo and put the Press in touch with the University booksellers, Fukumoto Stroin.</p>
<p>One important acquisition did come from Japan, however: A. S. Hornby's <a href="/wiki/Advanced_Learner%27s_Dictionary.html" title="Advanced Learner's Dictionary">Advanced Learner's Dictionary</a>.</p>

<p><a name="South_America" id="South_America"></a></p>
<h4>South America</h4>
<p>In December of 1909 Cobb returned and rendered his accounts for his Asia trip that year. Cobb then proposed to Milford that the Press join a combination of firms to send commercial travellers around South America, to which Milford in principle agreed. Cobb obtained the services of a man called Steer (first name unknown) to travel through Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay, Chile and possibly other countries as well, with Cobb to be responsible for Steer. Hodder &amp; Stoughton opted out of this venture, but OUP went ahead and contributed to it.</p>
<p>Steerâs trip was a disaster, and Milford remarked gloomily that it âbid fair to be the most costly and least productive on recordâ of all travellerâs trips. Steer returned before he had coverd more than half of his itinerary, and on returning failed to have his customs payments refunded, with the result that a hefty sum of Â£210 was lost to the Press. The Press was obliged to disburse 80 percent of the value of the books he had carried as âincidental expensesâ, so even if they had got substantial orders they would still have made a loss. Few orders did in fact come out of the trip, and when Steer's box of samples returned, the London office found that they had not been opened further down than the second layer. <sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a  title="">[21]</a></sup></p>
