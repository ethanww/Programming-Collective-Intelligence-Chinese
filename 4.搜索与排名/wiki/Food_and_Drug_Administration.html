<h2>Authorization and mandate</h2>
<p>The FDA derives its authority and jurisdiction from various Congressional acts. The main source of FDA's authority is the <a href="/wiki/Federal_Food%2C_Drug%2C_and_Cosmetic_Act.html" title="Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act">Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act</a>. Additionally, as a Federal agency, the FDA is required by <a href="/wiki/Executive_order.html" title="Executive order">Executive orders</a> <a  class="external text" title="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=1999_register&amp;docid=fr10au99-133.pdf">13132</a> to review all proposed new rules for Federalism issues.</p>
<p>The main purpose of the FDA is to protect citizens from products that are inherently unsafe or that make claims of effectiveness that cannot be substantiated. Because of the vast number of products or substances that may affect the public and the expertise required to evaluate them, Congress continues to find it expedient to delegate this task to a specilized <a href="/wiki/Administrative_agency.html" title="Administrative agency">administrative agency</a>.</p>
<p>The FDA thus has the power to regulate a multitude of products in a manner that ensures the safety of the American public and the effectiveness of marketed food, medical, and cosmetic products. <a href="/wiki/Regulation.html" title="Regulation">Regulations</a> may take several forms, including but not limited to outright ban, controlled distribution, and controlled marketing. Additionally, the FDA sets the standards under which individuals may be licensed to prescribe drugs or other medical devices. Regulatory enforcement is carried out by Consumer Safety Officers within the Office of Regulatory Affairs and criminal matters are handled by special agents within the <a href="/wiki/Office_of_Criminal_Investigations.html" title="Office of Criminal Investigations">Office of Criminal Investigations</a> (OCI).</p>

<p><a name="Selected_history_establishing_public_need" id="Selected_history_establishing_public_need"></a></p>
<h3>Selected history establishing public need</h3>
<ul>
<li>1862 — President Lincoln appoints chemist, Charles M. Wetherill to the Department of Agriculture. This appointment led to the Bureau of Chemistry.</li>
<li>1906 — <a href="/wiki/Upton_Sinclair.html" title="Upton Sinclair">Upton Sinclair's</a> <a href="/wiki/The_Jungle.html" title="The Jungle">The Jungle</a> is published: this contributes to the creation of the FDA which received power through the 1906 <a href="/wiki/Pure_Food_and_Drug_Act.html" title="Pure Food and Drug Act">Pure Food and Drug Act</a>.</li>
<li>1927 — The "Bureau of Chemistry" is reorganized into two separate entities. Regulatory functions are located in the "Food, Drug, and Insecticide Administration", and non-regulatory research is located in the "Bureau of Chemistry and Soils".</li>
<li>1930 — The name of the "Food, Drug, and Insecticide Administration" is shortened to "Food and Drug Administration" (FDA) under an agricultural appropriations act.</li>
<li>1937 — Over 100 people died after consuming a raspberry-flavored sulfa elixir which had been rushed to market by the S.E. Massengill Company without any testing. About 70 percent of the elixir was <a href="/wiki/Diethylene_glycol.html" title="Diethylene glycol">diethylene glycol</a>, which is now known to be <a href="/wiki/Poison.html" title="Poison">poisonous</a> (related to antifreeze). However, the FDA was able to remove the sulfa elixir from the market because elixirs at the time were to contain alcohol as a solvent (not diethylene glycol).</li>
<li>1938 — The resulting sulfa elixir scandal and public outcry led to the passage of the <a href="/wiki/Federal_Food%2C_Drug%2C_and_Cosmetic_Act.html" title="Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act">Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act</a> of 1938, which gave the FDA the power to preapprove all new drugs introduced into interstate commerce. <sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a  title="">[1]</a></sup></li>
<li>1959 — During a 10-week period leading up to Thanksgiving, FDA recalled cranberry crops that may have been exposed to a weed killer, aminotriazole, which was known to cause cancer. FDA sampled 3653 batches amounting to over 33,000,000 pounds of cranberries and cranberry products. Samples that were deemed safe and did not contain the weed killer were stamped with FDA approval.</li>
<li>1960 — Frances Kelsey, who was in charge of reviewing new drug application, denied that thalidomide be allowed in the United States market. Already being manufactured and sold throughout Europe, Kelsey insisted there was not enough evidence of the drug's safety. Receiving pressure from thalidomide manufacturers, Kelsey would not budge.</li>
<li>1961 — November, Germany takes thalidomide, known as kevadon, off the market after several thousand newborns suffered the teratogenic effects--they were born with grave congenital abnormalities.</li>
<li>1982 — Cyanide poisoning in Tylenol capsules results in many deaths, leading the FDA to begin tamper-resistant packaging.</li>
<li>1990 — FDA promulgates regulations banning "gifts of substantial value" from drug companies to doctors. Minor gifts (like meals, tickets, and travel) are not banned.</li>
<li>1992 — Congress passes a new law creating a faster approvals process to legalize new drugs. The FDA must hire more reviewers and speed up reviews without sacrificing proper study and testing. The drug industry must pay "user fees" with every <a href="/wiki/New_drug_application.html" title="New drug application">new drug application</a>. A drug is given "fast-track" status if it meets a medical need not currently being met by any medication. Approval times drop from 30 to 12 months on average. 60% of new drugs come on the market in the U.S. first, before other countries. Before this law, when the approval process was slower, more new drugs came out in other countries first.<sup title="The text in the vicinity of this tag needs citation." class="noprint">[<a  title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><i>citation&#160;needed</i></a>]</sup></li>
<li>1997 — FDA loosens restrictions on consumer advertising. Drug companies are allowed to spend less time describing risks and side effects on <a href="/wiki/Television.html" title="Television">TV</a> commercials. A large increase in TV drug ads caused a large increase in drug sales within months.</li>
<li>Year unknown — The <a href="/wiki/Naval_Ordnance_Laboratory.html" title="Naval Ordnance Laboratory">Naval Ordnance Laboratory</a> White Oak site was apportioned to the FDA to become its new headquarters. However, budget reductions have delayed the move to White Oak for many FDA offices.</li>

<p><a name="Citizen.27s_Petitions" id="Citizen.27s_Petitions"></a></p>
<h3>Citizen's Petitions</h3>
<p>Anyone can request or petition FDA to change or create an Agency policy or regulation through the Citizen's Petition process. 21 <a href="/wiki/CFR.html" title="CFR">CFR</a> Part 10.30. <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://a257.g.akamaitech.net/7/257/2422/10apr20061500/edocket.access.gpo.gov/cfr_2006/aprqtr/21cfr10.30.htm">[1]</a>. Despite the name, this process is primarily used by companies seeking a change to an FDA policy.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Political susceptibility">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Political_susceptibility" id="Political_susceptibility"></a></p>
<h3>Political susceptibility</h3>
<p>Since the FDA derives its authority from enabling legislation, it is principally a delegate of Congress to handle the large number of detailed issues related to its authority. As such, it at any time may be redirected, reorganized or even dissolved at the discretion of Congress. This puts the purpose of the FDA at risk with any change in the balance of power in Congress.</p>
<p>In addition to direct control over the agency's charter, Congress has leverage over the FDA's operations by means of budget allocation. Since budgetary legislation and amendments are very common and many times have a "must pass" status, this method of control is much easier to implement than to gain the wide agreement by Congress to modify the charter of an agency.</p>
<p>Additionally, the FDA's Commissioner is nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate. This allows the President to select Commissioners who may be sympathetic to political issues he deems important. Additionally Senate rules allow for nominations to be blocked by means of <a href="/wiki/Filibuster.html" title="Filibuster">filibuster</a>, whereby the Senate must first obtain a <a href="/wiki/Super-majority.html" title="Super-majority">super-majority</a> of 60% to close debate on an issue before vote.</p>
<p>Finally, the Commissioner himself has discretion regarding the staff employees within the agency and has the power to influence their decisions simply by being able to dismiss those who are not aligned with his views.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Jurisdiction">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Jurisdiction" id="Jurisdiction"></a></p>
<h2>Jurisdiction</h2>
<p>The FDA does not pre-approve <a href="/wiki/Dietary_supplement.html" title="Dietary supplement">dietary supplements</a> on their safety and efficacy, unlike drugs. In contrast, the FDA can only go after dietary supplement manufacturers after they have put unsafe products on the market. However, certain foods (such as infant formula and medical foods) are deemed special nutritionals because they are consumed by highly vulnerable populations and are thus regulated more strictly than the majority of dietary supplements.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Jurisdictional conflicts">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Jurisdictional_conflicts" id="Jurisdictional_conflicts"></a></p>
<h3>Jurisdictional conflicts</h3>
<p>One aspect of its jurisdiction over <a href="/wiki/Food.html" title="Food">food</a> is regulation of the content of <a href="/wiki/Health_claims_on_food_labels.html" title="Health claims on food labels">health claims on food labels</a>. However, because regulating the content of labels impacts <a href="/wiki/First_Amendment.html" title="First Amendment">First Amendment</a> issues, FDA must balance concerns about the public health with the right to free speech. Daniel Troy, Chief Counsel of the Food and Drug Division from August 2001 to November 2004, raised the agency's focus on First Amendment issues.</p>

<p><a name="CDER_operations" id="CDER_operations"></a></p>
<h3>CDER operations</h3>
<p>The CDER, which regulates human pharmaceuticals, receives considerable public scrutiny, and thus implements processes that tend toward objectivity and tend to isolate decisions from being attributed to specific individuals. In keeping with this, reviews are generally staffed by teams that are intended to come to consensus on decisions.</p>
<p>Within the CDER "Review teams" employ around 1,300 employees to approve new drugs. Additionally, the CDER employs a "safety team" has 72 employees to determine whether new drugs are unsafe or present risks not disclosed in the product's labeling.</p>
<p>The FDA's budget for approving, labeling, and monitoring drugs is roughly $290 million per year. The safety team monitors the effects of more than 3,000 prescription drugs on 200 million people with a budget of about $15 million a year. The FDA requires a four phased series of <a href="/wiki/Clinical_trials.html" title="Clinical trials">clinical trials</a>, with phase three being the largest and usually requiring 1,000-3,000 patients.</p>

<p>The FDA has come under much criticism from many groups, including the <a href="/wiki/Government_Accountability_Office.html" title="Government Accountability Office">Government Accountability Office</a>. FDA regulations are blamed for causing high drug prices, keeping life-saving drugs off the market, prohibiting access to <a href="/wiki/Emergency_contraception.html" title="Emergency contraception">emergency contraceptives</a>, allowing unsafe drugs on the market because of pressure from pharmaceutical companies, and censoring health information about nutritional supplements and foods.</p>
<p>It has been proposed that the FDA be relegated to a voluntary inspection agency in order to remedy these problems. Others disagree with the proposition to leave the agency with only authority to do voluntary inspections because that could create new problems. They believe that consumers would not demand food and pharmaceutical products to be tested and that therefore they would not be evaluated for health and safety risks. And, they believe advertising claims of drugs would be uncontested in a court of law. They fear that the industry would essentially be left to regulation by corporations with a heavily invested future in the production and sale of these untried and untested pharmaceuticals.</p>

<p><a name="The_drug_approval_process" id="The_drug_approval_process"></a></p>
<h3>The drug approval process</h3>
<p>The FDA is charged with the task of approving or rejecting drugs that pharmaceutical companies want to market. Critics of the FDA's handling of this task generally fall into two groups. The first group claims that the approval process is too extensive, and keeps vital drugs off the market longer than is necessary. The second group argues that the process fails to properly screen for drugs with dangerous side-effects.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Dexfenfluramine.html" title="Dexfenfluramine">Dexfenfluramine</a>, <a href="/wiki/Troglitazone.html" title="Troglitazone">troglitazone</a> and <a href="/wiki/Vioxx.html" title="Vioxx">rofecoxib</a> (trade name Vioxx) are a few recent, high-profile examples of drugs approved by the FDA which later caused harm to patients. <a href="/wiki/Dexfenfluramine.html" title="Dexfenfluramine">Dexfenfluramine</a> was a diet drug which had been available outside the United States for several years. Critics charge that the FDA failed to pay attention to safety concerns raised by post-marketing data from abroad, which indicated an increased risk of <a href="/wiki/Pulmonary_hypertension.html" title="Pulmonary hypertension">pulmonary hypertension</a>.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Troglitazone.html" title="Troglitazone">Troglitazone</a> is a <a href="/wiki/Diabetes.html" title="Diabetes">diabetes</a> drug that was also available abroad at the time the FDA approved it. Like dexfenfluramine, post-marketing safety data indicated that the drug had dangerous side-effects (in this case, <a href="/wiki/Liver_failure.html" title="Liver failure">liver failure</a>). The drug was approved over the objections of several FDA reviewers, and was later pulled from the market.</p>
<p>In the case of <a href="/wiki/Vioxx.html" title="Vioxx">Vioxx</a>, a study indicated that a group taking the drug had four times the risk of heart attacks when compared to another group of patients taking another anti-inflammatory, <a href="/wiki/Naproxen.html" title="Naproxen">naproxen</a>. The FDA was aware of this study, but the manufacturer (<a href="/wiki/Merck.html" title="Merck">Merck</a>) argued that naproxene had aspirin-like protective effects. The FDA accepted this reasoning. After numerous lawsuits against Merck, the manufacturer voluntarily withdrew it from the market in 2004.</p>
<p>To avoid such mistakes, the FDA ensures that newly approved drugs have passed vigorous testing, which includes animal testing, clinical trials of healthy individuals, and clinical trials of individuals suffering from the disease the drug is meant to treat. The FDA also verifies safety, quality, efficacy, along with drug interactions, and how various drugs may work depending on age, race, and gender. Critics argue that this process is long, tedious, and costly, and dramatically lengthens the time it takes effective drugs to hit the market.</p>
<p>The FDA does fast-track new treatments for serious diseases where no treatment currently exists<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a  title="">[2]</a></sup>. This rule attempts to address situations where the risks of keeping lifesaving drugs off the market outweigh the risks the drugs might pose to consumers.</p>

<h2>Criticisms of US drug packaging and distribution practices</h2>
<p>In most countries, medications are prepackaged in sealed foilpacks and sold in marked packages with the name of the drug and the dose clearly stated. This method prevents the degradation of drugs due to exposure to humidity, oxygen and light. The United States is the only country where prescription medications are bought in bulk packages by retail pharmacies (non-hospital) and are provided to consumers in plastic pill containers. This practice is criticized because it shortens the useful life of many drugs. This practice has also allowed fraudulent pharmacies to mix expired medications with new medications. There are no controls in place at retail pharmacies to ensure that the drugs being sold have not expired.</p>

<h3>High drug prices</h3>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: The cost of drug development">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="The_cost_of_drug_development" id="The_cost_of_drug_development"></a></p>
<h4>The cost of drug development</h4>
<p>Many maintain that FDA regulations and policy contribute to unnecessarily high drug prices in America. One concern is that the cost of the approval process may provide a disincentive for firms to develop new drugs, and require high prices to recoup their investment. This argument however, shows a basic misunderstanding of the economics behind <a href="/wiki/Pricing.html" title="Pricing">pricing</a>. Prices are not based directly on cost, but are set with the goal of maximizing profit. (Whether the derived profits are 'fair' is another issue; see <a href="/wiki/Pharmaceutical_company.html" title="Pharmaceutical company">Pharmaceutical company</a>.) In a <a href="/wiki/Monopoly.html" title="Monopoly">monopolistic</a> market where <a href="/wiki/Demand.html" title="Demand">demand</a> is relatively <a href="/wiki/Price_elasticity_of_demand.html" title="Price elasticity of demand">inelastic</a>, a decrease in <a href="/wiki/Fixed_cost.html" title="Fixed cost">fixed cost</a> will have little effect on the optimal price. Put simply, unless the drug directly competes with a lower priced drug, lowering the price dramatically wouldn't attract enough new customers to make up for the lost revenue. The expected effect of decreasing regulatory costs would be to add to industry profitability, and possibly to encourage increases in R&amp;D expenditure. However, the magnitude of these effects would depend upon the amount of the costs that could reasonably be cut, compared to the total cost of drug research and development.</p>
<p>1995 and 2002 studies by Joseph A. Dimasi claim that it costs, on the average, approximiately 800 million dollars to bring a drug to market. <sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a  title="">[3]</a></sup> This figure includes the high cost of failed research programs (which it is presumed must be pursued in order that some may succeed), and the drug company's <a href="/wiki/Opportunity_cost_of_capital.html" title="Opportunity cost of capital">opportunity cost of capital</a>, which is very high because it is compounded over long (15-20 year) development cycles.</p>
<p>Dimasi's critics question whether this is a fair allocation of costs, and have alleged that <a href="/wiki/Conflict_of_interest.html" title="Conflict of interest">conflicts of interest</a> exist because the data was obtained from drug manufactures, and the center which employs Dimasi is partially funded by pharmaceutical companies. More specifically, they point out that he failed to consider government research grants and tax rebates, and claim that the scope of the research was too narrow because it only included <a href="/wiki/New_chemical_entity.html" title="New chemical entity">New Chemical Entities</a> (NCEs). Such critics suggest a revised cost that is under 200 million dollars, about 29% of which is spent on FDA required clinical trials.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a  title="">[4]</a></sup> However, the objective of the DiMasi paper was not to determine "out of pocket" costs for individual projects, but to acertain the "price of innovation" in terms that reflect a firm's <a href="/wiki/Incentive.html" title="Incentive">incentive</a> to perform research and development of novel pharmaceuticals. Furthermore, under no circumstance would it be reasonable to forgo clinical trials entirely, and a marginal decrease in their cost would have a correspondingly small effect on total drug development costs.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Competition">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Competition" id="Competition"></a></p>
<h4>Competition</h4>
<p>A second way in which the FDA is seen to be responsible for high drug prices is by opposing the importation of cheaper drugs from foreign sources, which is held to be an anti-competitive policy that keeps drug prices artificially high in the United States. Prices of almost all pharmaceutical drugs in Europe are significantly lower than in the United States. <sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a  title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>With regard to patented drugs, this argument fails to suggest any beneficial policy changes. If there is a single supplier of a drug, then the difference in prices is simply a <a href="/wiki/Variable_pricing.html" title="Variable pricing">variable pricing</a> strategy which benefits both the drug manufacturers and consumers in less-affluent markets. If unhindered re-importation were allowed, either shortages would occur in cheaper markets (likely without satisfying U.S. demand), or companies would have to set the same price in all markets. Because a large proportion of the industry's revenue comes from the U.S., Europe, and Japan, a universal price would likely be close to the current prices in those markets (excluding countries with price caps). Not only would the industry's ability to conduct research be crippled by reduced profitability, but also consumers in many markets would be unable to afford the drugs. Where price differences do exist for patented drugs, the lower prices are often due to government imposed price caps, not because of "competition" from the manufacturer's other markets. These price controls result in artificially low margins in these markets, which in turn lead to less available capital for research and development. Because of this, many contend that through higher prices, U.S. consumers pay a disproportionate amount of the cost of developing new medicines.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a  title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>It is common for generic manufacturers to enter the market very soon after a drug's patent protection is lost, and for both companies to begin selling at dramatically lower prices. Importation is not banned by FDA, so long as the imported drug complies with FDA regulations regarding importation. They observe that the FDA requires imported drugs to meet the same safety, efficacy, and manufacturing standards as those manufactured in the United States. These standards are similar in the United States, the European Union, Japan, and most of the world (represented by the WHO), all of which observe guidelines set forth by the <a href="/wiki/International_Conference_on_Harmonisation_of_Technical_Requirements_for_Registration_of_Pharmaceuticals_for_Human_Use.html" title="International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use">International Conference on Harmonisation</a> (ICH). Although some drugs that are approved by European regulatory agencies are not approved in the U.S., this would not be expected to affect the prices of approved drugs.</p>
<p>Some offer the observation that prices of nutritional supplements in Europe are much more expensive than in the U.S. <sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a  title="">[7]</a></sup> They note that nutritional supplements are regulated in Europe, but not in the U.S. (as a result of the passage of the <a href="/wiki/Dietary_Supplement_Health_and_Education_Act.html" title="Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act">Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act</a>, which severely limits the ability of the FDA to regulate them). Many nutritional supplements require a prescription in Europe, but not in the U.S. Hence, they reason that a cause of high pharmaceutical costs in the U.S. is regulation. Consequently, they reason that if the FDA discontinued regulating pharmaceuticals that they would be much more affordable. <sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a  title="">[8]</a></sup> Requiring individuals to pay to visit a doctor to obtain a <a href="/wiki/Prescription.html" title="Prescription">prescription</a> for a drugs further increases costs to the consumer. Many countries have much less strict regulations on what drugs may be dispensed without a prescription. These drugs are available for importation without a prescription in the <a href="/wiki/Underground_economy.html" title="Underground economy">underground economy</a> through the internet, but few take advantage of this due to legal fears.</p>

<h4>Protecting U.S. pharmaceuticals from foreign competition</h4>
<p>The FDA has been criticized regarding its delayed approval of foreign drugs to protect the US pharmaceutical companies from foreign competition. Eli Lilly's Fluoxetine was the first SSRI to be approved by the FDA. Kali-Duphar, the Dutch manufacturer of another antidepressant fluvoxamine, had first attempted to apply for FDA review in the early 1980's (much earlier than Eli Lilly) but fluvoxamine was not approved until the rights were bought by the US pharmaceutical company Reid Rowell. Critics have suggested that the FDA was attempting to protect Eli-Lilly's fluoxetine so it could gain a foothold in the US market before approving fluvoxamine.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a  title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p>Similarly, the FDA has blocked the approval of the French sunblock Meroxyl and critics have suggested that the reason behind this was been an attempt to protect US sunscreen manufacturers. Helioplex is a sunscreen additive manufactured by the Neutrogena division of the US pharmaceutical giant Johnson and Johnson. Helioplex will soon hit the US market and is the only US competition to Meroxyl. Even though helioplex is not a sunscreen itself, it prevents the breakdown of avobenzone and oxybenzone, which are two US approved sunscreens.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a  title="">[10]</a></sup></p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Regarding drug approval">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Regarding_drug_approval" id="Regarding_drug_approval"></a></p>
<h3>Regarding drug approval</h3>
<p>One of the key issues of drug safety dealt with by the FDA, and responsible for much recent controversy, is related to the concept of <a href="/wiki/Patent.html" title="Patent">patents</a>. When a patent is awarded, the drug's creator is given exclusive manufacturing rights. If the drug is extremely popular, this motivates other companies to invent their own (different) drugs which accomplish the same effect. For example, <a href="/wiki/Cialis.html" title="Cialis">Cialis</a> was created because of the popularity of <a href="/wiki/Viagra.html" title="Viagra">Viagra</a>. However, the question is, when new, competing substances come out should they be approved, not because of their absolute safety, but because of their relative safety compared to an <a href="/wiki/Approved_drug.html" title="Approved drug">approved drug</a>. For example, say "drug b" was created to compete with "drug a". Now if "drug b" was the first one out, and it had a 5 percent chance of heart attack, the FDA might find this acceptable. However if "drug a" was already out, and it had a 2.5 percent chance of heart attack, then the FDA would be reluctant to approve "b". Only people who were ignorant of that higher risk would take drug b — unless it were significantly cheaper, and the purchaser preferred the price savings of "b" to the relative safety of "a".</p>
<p>This phenomenon is at the center of a present controversy over the recall of <a href="/wiki/Vioxx.html" title="Vioxx">Vioxx</a>, which is causing more attention to be brought to the FDA. <a href="/wiki/David_Graham.html" title="David Graham">David Graham</a>, a scientist with the FDA, says he was pressured by his supervisors not to warn the public about dangers of drugs like Vioxx, and so recommended to congress that a separate agency be created which is dedicated to continuously monitoring drug safety.</p>
<p>Under the <a  class="new" title="Prescription Drug User Fees Act">Prescription Drug User Fees Act</a>, the FDA charges fees to pharmaceutical companies in order to shorten the average length of the drug approval process.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a  title="">[11]</a></sup> These fees are meant to offset FDA staff costs and related expenses. This can be considered to be a conflict of interest, as the companies who are supposed to be regulated by the FDA are those who are paying them to conduct the approval process. Some critics further allege that this "pay-off" may sacrifice the quality of studies. However, these concerns are often based on an inadequate understanding of the process. These fees are charged to all companies (except for orphan drug submissions and first-time small business applicants), regardless of the priority or expedited status of the review. Several options do exist to speed the review of a proposed drug, but the criteria for priority status are designed in the interest of public health and are not tied in any way to monetary payments.</p>

<h3>Regarding incentive to delay approval of new drugs</h3>
<p>Many economists who study the FDA are critical.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a  title="">[12]</a></sup> Their views, however, are controversial. Economists <a href="/wiki/Milton_Friedman.html" title="Milton Friedman">Milton Friedman</a>, Daniel B. Klein and Alexander Tabarrok are three economists who argue that the FDA causes a <i>net</i> harm.</p>
<p>Friedman (1979) notes that the FDA can make two types of errors.<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a  title="">[13]</a></sup> <b>Type 1</b> is to approve a drug that has deadly or harmful side effects in a large number of people. If you make this error, like approving a <a href="/wiki/Thalidomide.html" title="Thalidomide">thalidomide</a>, you will be blasted by the news media, and your reputation will be ruined.</p>
<p><b>Type 2</b> is refusing approval of a drug that is capable of saving many lives or relieving great distress and that has no untoward side effects. If you make a type 2 error, few will know it, as the people whose lives might have been saved will not be around to protest, and their families will have no way of knowing that their loved ones lost their lives because of the caution of an unknown FDA official.</p>
<p>The following table from <a  class="external free" title="http://www.fdareview.org/incentives.shtml">http://www.fdareview.org/incentives.shtml</a> illustrates the two types of error and the reason for systematic bias toward type 2 errors.</p>

<p>This dichotomy was brought to the fore in the early days of AIDS. Noted AIDS author <a href="/wiki/Randy_Shilts.html" title="Randy Shilts">Randy Shilts</a> published a future timeline analysis in the <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i> showing a minimum delay of 20 years to approve the new AIDS drugs and get them to patients. Standard industrial project expediting techniques of identifying critical paths and starting tasks in parallel were foreign to the medical bureaucracy. A massive demonstration by <a href="/wiki/ACT_UP.html" title="ACT UP">ACT UP</a> and other groups occupied FDA headquarters, hanging a "Silence = Death" banner over the entrance. Afterwards, the "Pert chart" for approval of <a href="/wiki/Protease_inhibitors.html" title="Protease inhibitors">protease inhibitors</a> and other drugs was given a major rework and procedures introduced for expediting timelines for both normal and compassionate/experimental drug introduction.</p>
<p>Friedman theorizes that the harm the FDA causes results from the nature of the bureaucracy and would happen even with the best intentioned and benevolent individuals in charge: "With the best will in the world, you or I, if we were in that position, would be led to reject or postpone approval of many a good drug in order to avoid even a remote possibility of approving a drug that will have newsworthy side effects." Friedman recommends that the FDA be abolished to remedy the problem.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a  title="">[14]</a></sup></p>

<p>FDA was involved in an incident that involved one of the few government book-burnings that ever to take place in the United States. The FDA went to court in 1956 to act against the interstate shipment of "<a href="/wiki/Orgone_accumulator.html" title="Orgone accumulator">orgone accumulators</a>", an experimental device built by an aging Dr. <a href="/wiki/Wilhelm_Reich.html" title="Wilhelm Reich">Wilhelm Reich</a>.

<h3>Regarding blood donation</h3>
<p>In the past, it was the practice in America and other countries to separate blood donations on the basis of race, ethnicity, or religion, or to exclude certain groups from the donor pool on those bases. Currently, in the U.S., these practices have been eliminated, although <a href="/wiki/American_Red_Cross.html" title="American Red Cross">American Red Cross</a> and FDA policies prohibit accepting blood donations from homo- and bisexual men, specifically from any "male who has had sex with another male since 1977, even once", <sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a  title="">[15]</a></sup> or from intravenous drug users or recent immigrants from certain countries with high rates of HIV infection. While the inclusion of homo- and bisexual men on the prohibited list has created some controversy, the FDA and Red Cross cite the public policy need to protect the blood supply from HIV &amp; similar diseases as justification for the continued ban, issued in <a href="/wiki/1985.html" title="1985">1985</a>.</p>

<h3>Censorship</h3>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Federal_Food%2C_Drug%2C_and_Cosmetic_Act.html" title="Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act">Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act</a> ("FDCA") defines a drug, in part, as any article intended to prevent, cure, or mitigate a disease or condition. Any claim that a product could prevent, cure, or mitigate a disease or condition are referred to as "drug claims." Any seller that makes a drug claim about their product would be, by definition under the FDCA, claiming that their product is a drug. Once defined as a new drug under the FDCA, the seller would have to ensure that their product adhere to all the standards of a new drug including obtaining a <a href="/wiki/New_drug_application.html" title="New drug application">new drug application</a> from FDA through the use of clinical trials to prove safety and efficacy. Thus, the FDA is often criticized for restricting the ability of certain products (e.g., nutritional supplements, foods, cosmetics, etc.) from making certain claims related to the products impact on overall health of the consumer. FDA defends its ability to restrict these claims based on the definition of a drug under the FDCA and its ability to regulate new drugs. Dietary supplements and certain foods are allowed to make structure/function claims and health claims that resemble drug claims, but are regulated differently.</p>

For example, the FDA has threatened the <a href="/wiki/Cherry.html" title="Cherry">cherry</a> industry with legal measures unless it stops mentioning certain health benefits.<sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a  title="">[22]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a  title="">[23]</a></sup> The FDA has sent letters to cherry distributors saying that when health benefits are mentioned, the cherries then become "drugs" that are subject to seizure.<sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a  title="">[24]</a></sup></p>
<p>Food safety advocates have criticized the FDA for allowing meat manufacturers to use carbon monoxide gas mixtures during the packaging process to prevent discoloration of meat. This discoloration is an important indicator that the meat is spoiling due to bacterial growth. The United States is the only country that allows this technology. Such technology has been banned in Europe <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/06050/657804.stm">[2]</a>. Food safety critics have suggested that the powerful agricultural lobby has used its political power to influence the FDA's approval of this process.</p>
<p>A second criticism that food safety advocates have made against the FDA has involved their approval of certain coal tar derived food dyes such as FDC yellow 5 and 6 which are banned in most European countries. There are concerns about carcinogenicity of these food colors <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://.www.diet-studies.com/dye-studies.html">[3]</a>.</p>
<p>A third criticism of FDA food safety regulations has involved the lax pesticide regulations in the United States agricultural products.</p>
<p>A fourth important criticism of FDA food safety regulations has involved the FDA approval of the use of bovine growth hormone in dairy cows. This hormone increases milk production in cows but critics have pointed out that there was a surplus of milk production even before the use of bovine growth hormone. There is some evidence that BGH increases levels of IGF-1 in cow milk which can promote the growth of cancers in humans <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://.www.hsibaltimore.com/ealerts/ea200204/ea20020415.html">[4]</a>.</p>
<p>A fifth important criticism of FDA food safety regulations has involved the use of growth enhancing agents in cows which includes the use of antibiotics. The use of antibiotics are believed to be the primary cause for the development of antibiotic resistant strains of bacteria which pose a real threat to mankind <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://.www.hsibaltimore.com/ealerts/ea200204/ea20020415.html">[5]</a> .</p>

<h4>Medicines</h4>
<p>The FDA approves the labeling information to appear on the labeling of both over-the-counter (OTC) products as well as prescription products. Some have criticized FDA's restriction of certain information on OTC products as being counterproductive. For instance, The FDA prohibits aspirin packages from containing the research-backed information that taking an asprin every day reduces the risk of heart attack. Some argue that the restrictions save consumers from having bad information, but the counter argument is that they are also prohibited from having good information. Some medicine manufactures have proposed a compromise, where the FDA could say what they want on the label of a medicine while the manufacturer could say what they want as well. However, this proposal has been rejected by the FDA. <sup id="_ref-24" class="reference"><a  title="">[25]</a></sup></p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Preemption and prescription drug labeling">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Preemption_and_prescription_drug_labeling" id="Preemption_and_prescription_drug_labeling"></a></p>
<h4>Preemption and prescription drug labeling</h4>
<p>In the preamble to the new prescription drug regulations, which go into effect on <a href="/wiki/June_30.html" title="June 30">June 30</a>, FDA has stated that it believes that the warnings it approves for prescription drugs represents both the minimum and maximum that a pharmaceutical company is allowed to state on its labeling. If courts adopted this theory of preemption, lawsuits against a pharmaceutical companies for failure to warn consumers on the possible dangers of a drug could not prevail if the FDA was fully aware of the information and did not require the warning. Essentially, FDA is arguing that as a part of the federal government its decisions on what warnings should appear on labeling of a prescription drug product cannot be second-guessed by states or state courts because its federal action "preempts" states from regulating this arena. It should be noted, that FDA's pronouncements in the preambles to final rules are merely FDA's interpretation of the law and have no binding effect on state or federal courts. <sup id="_ref-25" class="reference"><a  title="">[26]</a></sup> <sup id="_ref-26" class="reference"><a  title="">[27]</a></sup></p>
