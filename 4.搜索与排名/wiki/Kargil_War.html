</div>
<p>Before the <a href="/wiki/Partition_of_India.html" title="Partition of India">Partition of India</a> in <a href="/wiki/1947.html" title="1947">1947</a>, <a href="/wiki/Kargil.html" title="Kargil">Kargil</a> was part of <a href="/wiki/Gilgit-Baltistan.html" title="Gilgit-Baltistan">Gilgit-Baltistan</a>, a region of many diverse linguistic, ethnic and religious groups, due in part to the many isolated valleys separated by some of the world's highest mountains. The <a href="/wiki/First_Kashmir_War.html" title="First Kashmir War">First Kashmir War</a> (1947-48) resulted in most of the Kargil region remaining an Indian territory; then, after Pakistan's defeat in the <a href="/wiki/Indo-Pakistani_War_of_1971.html" title="Indo-Pakistani War of 1971">Indo-Pakistani War of 1971</a>, the remaining areas, including strategic military posts, also passed into Indian territory. Notably, Kargil is the only <a href="/wiki/Districts_of_India.html" title="Districts of India">district</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Ladakh.html" title="Ladakh">Ladakh</a> subdivision that has a <a href="/wiki/Islam.html" title="Islam">Muslim</a> majority. The town and district of Kargil is in what is now called <a href="/wiki/Jammu_and_Kashmir.html" title="Jammu and Kashmir">Jammu and Kashmir</a>. The town lies on the Line of Control (LOC), the defacto border for the two nations, located 120 km (75 miles) from <a href="/wiki/Srinagar.html" title="Srinagar">Srinagar</a>, facing the <a href="/wiki/Northern_Areas_of_Pakistan.html" title="Northern Areas of Pakistan">Northern Areas of Pakistan</a>. Like other areas in the <a href="/wiki/Himalayas.html" title="Himalayas">Himalayas</a>, it has a <a href="/wiki/Temperate.html" title="Temperate">temperate</a> climate. Summers are cool with frigid nights, while winters are long and cold with temperatures often dropping to −40&#160;°C (−40&#160;°F). A <a href="/wiki/Indian_highways.html" title="Indian highways">national highway</a> connecting Srinagar to <a href="/wiki/Leh.html" title="Leh">Leh</a> cuts through Kargil.</p>
<p>The area that witnessed the infiltration and fighting is a 160 km long stretch on the border of the LOC, overlooking a vital highway on the Indian side of Kashmir. Apart from the district capital, Kargil, the <a href="/wiki/Front_line.html" title="Front line">front line</a> in the conflict encompassed the tiny town of <a href="/wiki/Drass.html" title="Drass">Drass</a> as well as the Batalik sector, Mushko <a href="/wiki/Valley.html" title="Valley">Valley</a> and other nearby areas along the de facto <a href="/wiki/International_border.html" title="International border">border</a>. The military outposts on these <a href="/wiki/Ridge.html" title="Ridge">ridges</a> were generally around 5,000 metres (16,000 feet) high, with a few as high as 5,600 metres (18,000 feet). One of the main reasons why Kargil was specifically targeted for incursions was its terrain lent itself to a <a href="/wiki/Preemptive_war.html" title="Preemptive war">pre-emptive seizure</a>. With tactically vital features and well-prepared defensive posts atop the peaks, it provided an ideal high ground for a defender akin to a <a href="/wiki/Fortress.html" title="Fortress">fortress</a>. Any attack to dislodge the enemy and reclaim high ground in a <a href="/wiki/Mountain_warfare.html" title="Mountain warfare">mountain warfare</a> would require a far higher ratio of attackers to defenders, which is further exacerbated by the high altitude and freezing temperatures. Additionally, Kargil was just 173 km (108 mi) from the Pakistan town of <a href="/wiki/Skardu.html" title="Skardu">Skardu</a>, which was capable of providing logistical and artillery support to the Pakistani <a href="/wiki/Combatant.html" title="Combatant">combatants</a>. All these tactical reasons, plus the Kargil district being a Muslim majority, were probably contributing factors to why Kargil was chosen as the location to attack.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>After the <a href="/wiki/Bangladesh_Liberation_War.html" title="Bangladesh Liberation War">Bangladesh Liberation War</a> in <a href="/wiki/1971.html" title="1971">1971</a>, there had been a long period of relative calm among the two neighbours. But during the 1990s, escalating <a href="/wiki/Low_intensity_conflict.html" title="Low intensity conflict">tensions and conflict</a> with <a href="/wiki/Terrorism_in_Kashmir.html" title="Terrorism in Kashmir">separatists in Kashmir</a> as well as <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_testing.html" title="Nuclear testing">nuclear tests</a> by both countries in 1998 changed the scenario. Despite the belligerent atmosphere, both countries signed the <a href="/wiki/Lahore_Declaration.html" title="Lahore Declaration">Lahore Declaration</a> in February 1999 to provide a peaceful and <a href="/wiki/Bilateral.html" title="Bilateral">bilateral</a> solution to the Kashmiri issue. However, elements in the <a href="/wiki/Military_of_Pakistan.html" title="Military of Pakistan">Military of Pakistan</a> covertly trained and sent troops and <a href="/wiki/Paramilitary.html" title="Paramilitary">paramilitary</a> forces, some allegedly in the guise of <a href="/wiki/Mujahideen.html" title="Mujahideen">mujahideen</a>, into the Indian territory. The aim was to sever the link between Kashmir and Ladakh, and cause Indian forces to withdraw from the <a href="/wiki/Siachen_Glacier.html" title="Siachen Glacier">Siachen Glacier</a>, thus forcing India to negotiate a settlement of the broader Kashmir dispute. Pakistan also believed that any tension in the region would internationalise the Kashmir issue, helping it to secure a speedy resolution. Yet another goal may have been to boost the morale of the decade-long <a href="/wiki/Rebellion.html" title="Rebellion">rebellion</a> in <a href="/wiki/Indian-held_Kashmir.html" title="Indian-held Kashmir">Indian-held Kashmir</a> by taking a proactive role.</p>
<p>According to India's then <a href="/wiki/Chief_of_the_Army_Staff_of_Indian_Army.html" title="Chief of the Army Staff of Indian Army">army chief</a> Ved Prakash Malik, and many other scholars, the infiltration was <a href="/wiki/Code_name.html" title="Code name">code named</a> "Operation Badr",<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a  title="">[9]</a></sup> and much of the background planning, including construction of logistical supply routes, had been undertaken much earlier. On more than one occasion, the army had given past Pakistani leaders (namely <a href="/wiki/Zia_ul_Haq.html" title="Zia ul Haq">Zia ul Haq</a> and <a href="/wiki/Benazir_Bhutto.html" title="Benazir Bhutto">Benazir Bhutto</a>) similar proposals for an infiltration in the Kargil region in the 1980s and 1990s. However the plans had been shelved for fear of drawing the nations into all-out war.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a  title="">[10]</a></sup> <sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a  title="">[11]</a></sup> Some analysts believe that the blueprint of attack was reactivated when Pervez Musharraf was appointed chief of army staff in October 1998. In a disclosure made by <a href="/wiki/Nawaz_Sharif.html" title="Nawaz Sharif">Nawaz Sharif</a>, the then Prime Minister of Pakistan, he states that he was unaware of the preparation of the intrusion, and it was an urgent phone call from <a href="/wiki/Atal_Bihari_Vajpayee.html" title="Atal Bihari Vajpayee">Atal Bihari Vajpayee</a>, his counterpart in India, that informed him about the situation.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a  title="">[12]</a></sup> Sharif has attributed the plan to Musharraf and "just two or three of his cronies".<sup id="_ref-sharifunaware_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[13]</a></sup>Responding to this, Musharaf asserted that the Prime Minister had been briefed on the Kargil operation 15 days ahead of Vajpayee's journey to <a href="/wiki/Lahore.html" title="Lahore">Lahore</a> on <a href="/wiki/February_20.html" title="February 20">February 20</a>.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a  title="">[14]</a></sup></p>

<h2>War progress</h2>
<p>There were three major phases to the Kargil War. First, Pakistan captured several strategic high points in the Indian-controlled section of Kashmir. India responded by first capturing strategic transportation routes, then militarily pushing Pakistani forces back across the Line of Control.</p>

<p><a name="Occupation_by_Pakistan" id="Occupation_by_Pakistan"></a></p>
<h3>Occupation by Pakistan</h3>
<p>Because of the extreme winter weather in Kashmir, it was common practice for the Indian and Pakistan Army to abandon forward posts and reoccupy them in the <a href="/wiki/Spring_%28season%29.html" title="Spring (season)">spring</a>. That particular spring, the Pakistan Army reoccupied the forward posts before the scheduled time.</p>

Infiltration and military build-up.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>In early May 1999, the <a href="/wiki/Pakistan_Army.html" title="Pakistan Army">Pakistan Army</a> decided to occupy the Kargil posts, numbering around 130, and thus control the area. Troops from the elite <a href="/wiki/Special_Services_Group.html" title="Special Services Group">Special Services Group</a> as well as <a href="/wiki/Battalion.html" title="Battalion">battalions</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Northern_Light_Infantry.html" title="Northern Light Infantry">Northern Light Infantry</a> (a paramilitary regiment not part of the regular Pakistani army at that time) backed by Kashmiri <a href="/wiki/Guerrilla_warfare.html" title="Guerrilla warfare">guerrillas</a> and <a href="/wiki/Afghanistan.html" title="Afghanistan">Afghan</a> <a href="/wiki/Mercenary.html" title="Mercenary">mercenaries</a> covertly and overtly set up bases on the vantage points of the Indian-controlled region. Initially, these incursions were not spotted due to the heavy artillery fire by Pakistan across the Line of Control, which <a href="/wiki/Suppressive_fire.html" title="Suppressive fire">provided cover</a> for the infiltrators. But by the second week of May, the <a href="/wiki/Ambush.html" title="Ambush">ambushing</a> of an Indian patrol team, acting on a tip-off by a local shepherd in the Batalik sector, led to the exposure of the infiltration. Initially with little knowledge of the nature or extent of the encroachment, the Indian troops in the area claimed that they would evict them within a few days. However, reports of <a href="/wiki/Infiltration.html" title="Infiltration">infiltration</a> elsewhere along the LoC made it clear that the entire plan of attack was on a much bigger scale.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Government_of_India.html" title="Government of India">Government of India</a> responded with <a href="/wiki/Operation_Vijay.html" title="Operation Vijay">Operation Vijay</a>, a mobilisation of 200,000 Indian troops. However, because of the nature of the terrain, <a href="/wiki/Division_%28military%29.html" title="Division (military)">division</a> and <a href="/wiki/Corps.html" title="Corps">corps</a> operations could not be mounted; the scale of most fighting was at the <a href="/wiki/Regiment.html" title="Regiment">regimental</a> or battalion level. In effect, two <a href="/wiki/Division_%28military%29.html" title="Division (military)">divisions</a> of the Indian Army,<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a  title="">[15]</a></sup> numbering 20,000, plus several thousand from the <a href="/wiki/Indian_Paramilitary_Forces.html" title="Indian Paramilitary Forces">Indian Paramilitary Forces</a> and the air force were deployed in the conflict zone. The total number of Indian soldiers that were involved in the <a href="/wiki/Military_operation.html" title="Military operation">military operation</a> on the Kargil-Drass sector was thus close to 30,000. The number of infiltrators, including those providing logistical backup, has been put at approximately 5,000 at the height of the conflict.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a  title="">[16]</a></sup> This figure includes troops from <a href="/wiki/Pakistan-administered_Kashmir.html" title="Pakistan-administered Kashmir">Pakistan-administered Kashmir</a> that were involved in the war providing additional artillery support.</p>

<p><a name="Protection_of_National_Highway_No._1A" id="Protection_of_National_Highway_No._1A"></a></p>
<h3>Protection of National Highway No. 1A</h3>
<p>The terrain of Kashmir is mountainous and at high altitudes; even the best roads, such as National Highway No. 1 (NH 1) from Leh to Srinagar, are only two-lanes. The rough terrain and narrow roads slowed traffic, and the high altitude, which affected the ability of aircraft to carry loads, made control of NH 1A (the actual stretch of the highway which was under Pakistani fire) a priority for India. From their <a href="/wiki/Observation_post.html" title="Observation post">observation posts</a>, the Pakistani forces had a clear line of sight to lay down <a href="/wiki/Indirect_fire.html" title="Indirect fire">indirect artillery fire</a> on NH 1A. This was a serious problem for the Indian Army as the highway was its main logistical and supply route. The Pakistani shelling of the <a href="/wiki/Arterial_road.html" title="Arterial road">arterial road</a> posed the threat of Leh being cut off, though an alternative (and longer) road to Leh existed via <a href="/wiki/Himachal_Pradesh.html" title="Himachal Pradesh">Himachal Pradesh</a>.</p>
<p>The infiltrators, apart from being equipped with <a href="/wiki/Small_arms.html" title="Small arms">small arms</a> and <a href="/wiki/Grenade_launcher.html" title="Grenade launcher">grenade launchers</a>, were also armed with <a href="/wiki/Mortar_%28weapon%29.html" title="Mortar (weapon)">mortars</a>, <a href="/wiki/Artillery.html" title="Artillery">artillery</a> and <a href="/wiki/Anti-aircraft_warfare.html" title="Anti-aircraft warfare">anti-aircraft guns</a>. Many posts were also heavily <a href="/wiki/Land_mine.html" title="Land mine">mined</a>, with India later recovering nearly 9,000 <a href="/wiki/Land_mine#Anti-personnel_mines_.28AP.29.html" title="Land mine">anti-personnel mines</a> according to <a href="/wiki/International_Campaign_to_Ban_Landmines.html" title="International Campaign to Ban Landmines">ICBL</a>. Pakistan's <a href="/wiki/Reconnaissance.html" title="Reconnaissance">reconnaissance</a> was done through <a href="/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicles.html" title="Unmanned aerial vehicles">unmanned aerial vehicles</a> and <a href="/wiki/AN/TPQ-36_Firefinder_radar.html" title="AN/TPQ-36 Firefinder radar">AN/TPQ-36 Firefinder radars</a> supplied by the US.<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a  title="">[17]</a></sup> The initial Indian attacks were aimed at controlling the hills overlooking NH 1A, with high priority being given to the stretches of the highway near the town of Kargil. The majority of posts along the Line of Control were adjacent to the highway, and therefore the recapture of nearly every infiltrated post increased both the territorial gains and the security of the highway. The protection of this route and the recapture of the forward posts were thus <i>ongoing objectives</i> throughout the war. Though most of the posts in the vicinity of the highway were cleared by mid-June, some parts of the highway near Drass witnessed sporadic shelling until the end of the war.</p>

<p>Once India regained control of the hills overlooking NH 1A, the Indian Army turned to driving the invading force back across the Line of Control, but elected not to pursue forces further into the <a href="/wiki/Pakistan_Occupied_Kashmir.html" title="Pakistan Occupied Kashmir">Pakistani-controlled portion of Kashmir</a>. The <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Tololing.html" title="Battle of Tololing">Battle of Tololing</a>, among other assaults, slowly tilted the combat in India's favor. Nevertheless, some of the posts put up a stiff resistance, including Tiger Hill (Point 5140) that fell only later in the war. A few of the assaults occurred atop hitherto unheard of peaks – most of them unnamed with only Point numbers to differentiate them – which witnessed fierce <a href="/wiki/Hand_to_hand_combat.html" title="Hand to hand combat">hand to hand combat</a>. As the operation was fully underway, about 250 artillery guns were brought in to clear the infiltrators in the posts that were in the <a href="/wiki/Line_of_sight.html" title="Line of sight">line of sight</a>. The <a href="/wiki/Bofors.html" title="Bofors">Bofors</a> field <a href="/wiki/Howitzer.html" title="Howitzer">howitzer</a> (infamous in India due to the <a href="/wiki/Bofors_scandal.html" title="Bofors scandal">Bofors scandal</a>) played a vital role, with Indian <a href="/wiki/Gunner.html" title="Gunner">gunners</a> making maximum use of the <a href="/wiki/Terrain.html" title="Terrain">terrain</a> that assisted such an attack. However, its success was limited elsewhere due to the lack of space and depth to deploy the Bofors gun. It was in this type of terrain that <a href="/wiki/Aerial_warfare.html" title="Aerial warfare">aerial attacks</a> were introduced. The <a href="/wiki/Indian_Air_Force.html" title="Indian Air Force">Indian Air Force</a> launched <a href="/wiki/Operation_Safed_Sagar.html" title="Operation Safed Sagar">Operation Safed Sagar</a> but was limited by the high altitude, which in turn limited bomb loads and the number of <a href="/wiki/Airstrip.html" title="Airstrip">airstrips</a> that could be used. The IAF lost a <a href="/wiki/MiG-27.html" title="MiG-27">MiG-27</a> <a href="/wiki/Ground_attack_aircraft.html" title="Ground attack aircraft">strike aircraft</a> due to an <a href="/wiki/Flameout.html" title="Flameout">engine failure</a> as well as a <a href="/wiki/MiG-21.html" title="MiG-21">MiG-21</a> <a href="/wiki/Fighter_aircraft.html" title="Fighter aircraft">fighter</a> which was shot down by Pakistan; Pakistan said it shot down both jets after they crossed into its territory<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a  title="">[18]</a></sup>and one <a href="/wiki/Mi-8.html" title="Mi-8">Mi-8</a> <a href="/wiki/Helicopter.html" title="Helicopter">helicopter</a> to <a href="/wiki/FIM-92_Stinger.html" title="FIM-92 Stinger">Stinger</a> <a href="/wiki/Surface-to-air_missile.html" title="Surface-to-air missile">SAMs</a>. During attacks the IAF used <a href="/wiki/Laser-guided_bomb.html" title="Laser-guided bomb">laser-guided bombs</a> to destroy well-entrenched positions of the Pakistani forces.</p>
<p>In some vital points, neither artillery nor air power could dislodge the outposts manned by the Pakistan soldiers, who were out of visible range. The Indian Army mounted some direct frontal ground assaults which were slow and took a heavy toll given the steep ascent that had to be made on peaks as high as 18,000 feet (5,500 m). Since any daylight attack would be suicidal, all the advances had to be made under the cover of darkness, escalating the risk of freezing. Accounting for the <a href="/wiki/Wind_chill.html" title="Wind chill">wind chill</a> factor, the temperatures were often as low as −11&#160;°C to −15&#160;°C (12 °F to 5 °F) near the mountain tops. Based on <a href="/wiki/Military_tactics.html" title="Military tactics">military tactics</a>, much of the costly <a href="/wiki/Frontal_assault.html" title="Frontal assault">frontal assaults</a> by the Indians could have been avoided if the Indian Military had chosen to <a href="/wiki/Blockade.html" title="Blockade">blockade</a> the supply route of the opposing force, virtually creating a <a href="/wiki/Siege.html" title="Siege">siege</a>. Such a move would have involved the Indian troops crossing the LoC as well as initiating aerial attacks on Pakistan soil, a manoeuvre India was not willing to exercise fearing an expansion of the <a href="/wiki/Theater_%28warfare%29.html" title="Theater (warfare)">theatre of war</a> and reducing international support for its cause.</p>

<h2>World opinion</h2>
<p>Pakistan was criticised by the International community for allowing <a href="/wiki/Insurgent.html" title="Insurgent">insurgents</a> to cross the Line of Control.<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a  title="">[23]</a></sup> Pakistan's diplomatic response, one of <a href="/wiki/Plausible_deniability.html" title="Plausible deniability">plausible deniability</a> linking the incursion to what it officially termed as "Kashmiri <a href="/wiki/Freedom_fighter.html" title="Freedom fighter">freedom fighters</a>", was in the end not successful. Veteran analysts argued that the battle was fought at heights where only seasoned troops could survive, so poorly equipped "freedom fighters" would neither have the ability nor the wherewithal to seize land and defend it. Moreover, while the army had initially denied the involvement of its troops in the intrusion, two soldiers were awarded the <a href="/wiki/Nishan-E-Haider.html" title="Nishan-E-Haider">Nishan-E-Haider</a> (Pakistan's highest military honour). Another 90 soldiers were also given gallantry awards, most of them <a href="/wiki/Posthumous.html" title="Posthumous">posthumously</a>, confirming Pakistan's role in the episode. India also released <a href="/wiki/Telephone_tapping.html" title="Telephone tapping">taped</a> phone conversations between the Army Chief and a senior Pakistani general where the latter is recorded saying: "the scruff of [the militants] necks is in our hands,"<sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a  title="">[24]</a></sup> although Pakistan dismissed it as a "total fabrication".</p>
<p>As the Indian counter-attacks picked up momentum, Pakistani prime minister Nawaz Sharif flew to meet U.S. president Bill Clinton on <a href="/wiki/July_4.html" title="July 4">July 4</a> to obtain support from the United States. Clinton rebuked Sharif, however, and asked him to use his contacts to rein in the militants and withdraw Pakistani soldiers from Indian territory.

<p>The Kargil War was significant for the impact and influence of the <a href="/wiki/Mass_media.html" title="Mass media">mass media</a> in both nations, especially on the Indian side. Coming at a time of exploding growth in <a href="/wiki/Electronic_journalism.html" title="Electronic journalism">electronic journalism</a> in India, the Kargil news stories and war footage were often telecast live on TV, and many <a href="/wiki/Website.html" title="Website">websites</a> provided in-depth analysis of the war. The conflict became the first "<a href="/wiki/Live_television.html" title="Live television">live</a>" war in <a href="/wiki/South_Asia.html" title="South Asia">South Asia</a> that was given such detailed <a href="/wiki/Mass_media.html" title="Mass media">media</a> coverage, often to the extent of drumming up <a href="/wiki/Jingoism.html" title="Jingoism">jingoistic</a> feelings. The conflict soon turned into a <a href="/wiki/News_propaganda.html" title="News propaganda">news propaganda</a> war, with the official press briefings of both nations producing claims and counterclaims. It reached such a stage where an outside observer listening to both Indian as well as Pakistani coverage of this conflict, would wonder whether both sides were reporting on the same conflict. The Indian government placed a temporary <a href="/wiki/News_Embargo.html" title="News Embargo">news embargo</a> on information from Pakistan, even banning the telecast of the <a href="/wiki/Government-owned_corporation.html" title="Government-owned corporation">state-run</a> Pakistani channel <a href="/wiki/Pakistan_Television_Corporation.html" title="Pakistan Television Corporation">PTV</a> and blocked access to <a href="/wiki/Online.html" title="Online">online</a> editions of <i><a href="/wiki/Dawn_%28newspaper%29.html" title="Dawn (newspaper)">Dawn</a></i> newspaper. The Pakistani media played up this apparent curbing of <a href="/wiki/Freedom_of_the_press.html" title="Freedom of the press">freedom of the press</a> in India, while the latter claimed it was in the interests of <a href="/wiki/National_security.html" title="National security">national security</a>.

<p>As the war progressed, media coverage was more intense in India compared to Pakistan. Many Indian channels were showing images from the battle zone with their troops in a style reminiscent of <a href="/wiki/CNN.html" title="CNN">CNN</a>'s coverage of the <a href="/wiki/Gulf_War.html" title="Gulf War">Gulf War</a>. One of the reasons for India's increased coverage was the proliferation of numerous privately owned channels vis-à-vis the Pakistani <a href="/wiki/Electronic_media.html" title="Electronic media">electronic media</a> scenario which was still at a nascent stage. Yet another was the relatively greater <a href="/wiki/Media_transparency.html" title="Media transparency">transparency</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Mass_media_in_India.html" title="Mass media in India">Indian media</a>. In fact, at a <a href="/wiki/Seminar.html" title="Seminar">seminar</a> in <a href="/wiki/Karachi.html" title="Karachi">Karachi</a>, Pakistani <a  title="Category:Pakistani media">journalists</a> agreed that while the Indian government had taken the press and the people into its confidence, this was missing on the Pakistan side.<sup id="_ref-25" class="reference"><a  title="">[30]</a></sup> The Indian government also ran <a href="/wiki/Advertisement.html" title="Advertisement">advertisements</a> in foreign publications like <i><a href="/wiki/The_Times.html" title="The Times">The Times</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/The_Washington_Post.html" title="The Washington Post">The Washington Post</a></i> detailing Pakistan's <a href="/wiki/State-sponsored_terrorism.html" title="State-sponsored terrorism">role in supporting extremists</a> in Kashmir in an attempt to garner political support for its cause during the combat.

<p><a name="WMDs_and_the_nuclear_factor" id="WMDs_and_the_nuclear_factor"></a></p>
<h2>WMDs and the nuclear factor</h2>
<p>One of the main concerns in the international community during the Kargil crisis was that both neighbours had access to <a href="/wiki/Weapons_of_mass_destruction.html" title="Weapons of mass destruction">weapons of mass destruction</a>, and if the war intensified, it could have led to <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_war.html" title="Nuclear war">nuclear war</a>, though Pakistan continues to deny it was engaged in warfare with India.</p>
<p>Both countries had tested their nuclear capability a year before in 1998; India conducted its first test in 1974 while it was Pakistan's first-ever <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_testing.html" title="Nuclear testing">nuclear test</a>. Many <a href="/wiki/Pundit_%28politics%29.html" title="Pundit (politics)">pundits</a> believed the tests to be an indication of the escalating stakes in the scenario in South Asia. With the outbreak of clashes in Kashmir just a year after the nuclear tests, many nations took notice of the conflict and desired to end it.</p>
<p>The first hint of the possible use of a nuclear bomb was on <a href="/wiki/May_31.html" title="May 31">May 31</a> when Pakistani <a href="/wiki/Foreign_minister.html" title="Foreign minister">foreign secretary</a> Shamshad Ahmad made a statement warning that an escalation of the limited conflict could lead Pakistan to use "any weapon" in its <a href="/wiki/Arsenal.html" title="Arsenal">arsenal</a>.<sup id="_ref-27" class="reference"><a  title="">[32]</a></sup> This was immediately interpreted as an obvious threat of a nuclear retaliation by Pakistan in the event of an extended war, and the leader of <a href="/wiki/Senate_of_Pakistan.html" title="Senate of Pakistan">Pakistan's senate</a> noted, "The purpose of developing weapons becomes meaningless if they are not used when they are needed."<sup id="_ref-28" class="reference"><a  title="">[33]</a></sup> Many such ambiguous statements from officials of both countries were viewed as an impending nuclear crisis. The limited nuclear arsenals of both sides, paradoxically could have led to 'tactical' nuclear warfare in the belief that a nuclear strike would not have ended in total nuclear warfare with <a href="/wiki/Mutual_assured_destruction.html" title="Mutual assured destruction">mutual assured destruction</a>, as could have occurred between the <a href="/wiki/United_States.html" title="United States">United States</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Soviet_Union.html" title="Soviet Union">USSR</a> or the <a href="/wiki/People%27s_Republic_of_China.html" title="People's Republic of China">People's Republic of China</a>.</p>
<p>The nature of the India-Pakistan conflict took a more sinister proportion when the U.S. received intelligence that Pakistani nuclear <a href="/wiki/Warhead.html" title="Warhead">warheads</a> were being moved towards the border.

According to a <a href="/wiki/White_House.html" title="White House">White House</a> official, Sharif seemed to be genuinely surprised by this supposed missile movement and responded that India was probably planning the same.

<p>The aftermath of the war saw the rise of the <a href="/wiki/Bombay_Stock_Exchange.html" title="Bombay Stock Exchange">Indian stock market</a> by over 1,500 points. The next <a href="/wiki/Union_budget_of_India.html" title="Union budget of India">Indian national budget</a> included major increases in military spending. From the end of the war until February 2000, the <a href="/wiki/Economy_of_India.html" title="Economy of India">economy of India</a> was <a href="/wiki/Market_trends.html" title="Market trends">bullish</a>.

The war had also produced higher than expected fatalities for the Indian military, with a sizeable percentage of them including newly <a href="/wiki/Officer_%28armed_forces%29#Commissioned_officers.html" title="Officer (armed forces)">commissioned officers</a>. One month later, the <a href="/wiki/Atlantique_Incident.html" title="Atlantique Incident">Atlantique Incident</a> - where a <a href="/wiki/Pakistan_Navy.html" title="Pakistan Navy">Pakistan Navy</a> plane was shot down by India - briefly reignited fears of a conflict between the two countries.</p>
<p>After the war, the Indian government severed ties with Pakistan and increased defence preparedness. Since the Kargil conflict, India raised its <a href="/wiki/Defense_budget.html" title="Defense budget">defence budget</a> as it sought to acquire more state of the art equipment; however, a few irregularities came to light during this period of heightened military expenditure.<sup id="_ref-32" class="reference"><a  title="">[37]</a></sup> There was also severe criticism of the <a href="/wiki/Intelligence_agency.html" title="Intelligence agency">intelligence agencies</a> like <a href="/wiki/Research_and_Analysis_Wing.html" title="Research and Analysis Wing">RAW</a>, which failed to predict either the intrusions or the identity/number of infiltrators during the war. An internal assessment report by the armed forces, published in an Indian magazine, showed several other failings, including "a sense of complacency" and being "unprepared for a <a href="/wiki/Conventional_war.html" title="Conventional war">conventional war</a>" on the presumption that <a href="/wiki/Nuclearism.html" title="Nuclearism">nuclearism</a> would sustain peace.

<p>The Kargil victory was followed by the <a href="/wiki/Indian_general_elections_1977-1999#1999.html" title="Indian general elections 1977-1999">13th Indian General Elections</a> to the <a href="/wiki/Lok_Sabha.html" title="Lok Sabha">Lok Sabha</a>, which gave a decisive <a href="/wiki/Mandate_%28politics%29.html" title="Mandate (politics)">mandate</a> to the <a href="/wiki/National_Democratic_Alliance_%28India%29.html" title="National Democratic Alliance (India)">NDA</a> government.

On the diplomatic front, the conflict was a major boost to Indo-U.S. relations, as the United States appreciated Indian attempts to restrict the conflict to a limited geographic area.

</div>
<p>Faced with the possibility of international isolation, the <a href="/wiki/Economy_of_Pakistan.html" title="Economy of Pakistan">Pakistani economy</a> tumbled. The morale of its forces after early gains was damaged<sup id="_ref-35" class="reference"><a  title="">[40]</a></sup> as many units of the Northern Light Infantry were destroyed,<sup id="_ref-36" class="reference"><a  title="">[41]</a></sup> and the government refused to even recognise the dead bodies of its soldiers.<sup id="_ref-37" class="reference"><a  title="">[42]</a></sup> Pakistan initially did not acknowledge many of its casualties, but Sharif later said that over 4,000 Pakistani troops were killed in the operation and that Pakistan had lost the conflict.<sup id="_ref-hindu_1" class="reference"><a  title="">[3]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-dawn_1" class="reference"><a  title="">[4]</a></sup> However, in a rare reference to Kargil, <a href="/wiki/President_of_Pakistan.html" title="President of Pakistan">Pakistan President</a> Pervez Musharraf said, "It hurts me when an ex-premier undermines his own forces," when questioned about Sharif's comments on Pakistan's losses in Kargil and claimed that Indian casualties were more than that of Pakistan.<sup id="_ref-38" class="reference"><a  title="">[43]</a></sup></p>
<p>Many in Pakistan had expected a victory over the <a href="/wiki/Military_of_India.html" title="Military of India">Indian military</a> but were dismayed by the turn of events and questioned the eventual retreat.<sup id="_ref-39" class="reference"><a  title="">[44]</a></sup> The military leadership felt let down by the prime minister's decision to <a href="/wiki/Withdrawal_%28military%29.html" title="Withdrawal (military)">withdraw</a> the remaining fighters. And with Sharif placing the onus of the Kargil attacks squarely on the army chief Pervez Musharraf, there was an atmosphere of uneasiness between the two. On <a href="/wiki/October_12.html" title="October 12">October 12</a>, <a href="/wiki/1999.html" title="1999">1999</a>, General Musharraf staged a bloodless <i><a href="/wiki/Coup_d%27%C3%A9tat.html" title="Coup d'état">coup d'état</a></i>, ousting Nawaz Sharif.</p>
<p>Benazir Bhutto, an opposition leader and former prime minister, called the Kargil War "Pakistan's greatest blunder". Many ex-officials of the military and the <a href="/wiki/Inter-Services_Intelligence.html" title="Inter-Services Intelligence">ISI</a> (Pakistan's principal <a href="/wiki/Intelligence_agency.html" title="Intelligence agency">intelligence agency</a>) also were of the view that "Kargil was a waste of time" and "could not have resulted in any advantage" on the larger issue of Kashmir.<sup id="_ref-40" class="reference"><a  title="">[45]</a></sup> The Pakistani media too was vocal in its criticism of the whole plan and the eventual climbdown from the Kargil heights since there were no gains to show for the loss of lives and only resulted in international condemnation for its actions.<sup id="_ref-41" class="reference"><a  title="">[46]</a></sup> Despite calls by many for a probe, no public commission of inquiry was set up to investigate the people responsible for initiating the conflict. However, the Pakistani political party, <a href="/wiki/Pakistan_Muslim_League_%28N%29.html" title="Pakistan Muslim League (N)">PML(N)</a> recently unveiled a <a href="/wiki/White_paper.html" title="White paper">white paper</a> which states that Nawaz Sharif constituted an inquiry committee that recommended a <a href="/wiki/Court_martial.html" title="Court martial">court martial</a> for General Pervez Musharraf.<sup id="_ref-42" class="reference"><a  title="">[47]</a></sup> The party alleges that Musharraf "stole the report" after toppling the government, to save himself. The report also claims that India knew about the plan 11 months before its launch, enabling a complete victory for India on military, diplomatic and economic fronts.<sup id="_ref-43" class="reference"><a  title="">[48]</a></sup> Though it had brought the Kashmir dispute into international focus – which was one of the aims of Pakistan – it had done so in negative circumstances that eroded its credibility, since the infiltration came just after a peace process between the two countries was underway. The sanctity of the LoC too received international recognition.</p>
<p>A few changes were made to the army. In recognition of its part in the war, the Northern Light Infantry regiment was incorporated into the regular army. The war showed that despite a tactically sound plan that had the element of surprise, little groundwork had been done to gauge the politico-diplomatic ramifications. And like previous unsuccessful infiltrations attempts like <i><a href="/wiki/Operation_Gibraltar.html" title="Operation Gibraltar">Operation Gibraltar</a></i> that sparked <a href="/wiki/Indo-Pakistani_War_of_1965.html" title="Indo-Pakistani War of 1965">the 1965 war</a>, there was little coordination or information sharing among the branches of the <a href="/wiki/Military_of_Pakistan.html" title="Military of Pakistan">Pakistan military</a>. All these factors contributed to a strategic failure for Pakistan in Kargil.</p>

<h2>Notes</h2>
<div class="references-small">
<p><cite id="fn_.28I.29"><a  title="">Note (I)</a>:</cite> Names for the conflict: There have been various names for the conflict. During the actual fighting in Kargil, the Indian Government was careful not to use the term "war", calling it a "war-like situation", even though both nations indicated that they were in a "state of war". Terms like Kargil "conflict", Kargil "incident" or the official military assault, "<a href="/wiki/Operation_Vijay.html" title="Operation Vijay">Operation Vijay</a>", were thus preferred. After the end of the war however, the Indian Government increasingly called it the "Kargil War", even though there had been no official declaration of war. Other less popularly used names included "Third Kashmir War" and Pakistan's codename given to the infiltration: "Operation Badr".</p>
<p><cite id="fn_.28II.29"><a  title="">Note (II)</a>:</cite> Casualties: The exact count of casulties on the Indian side has often been quoted by various sources as between 500 - 600. The Indian Government officially acknowledges the deaths of 527 soldiers and along with the 5 personnel from the Indian Air Force the total reaches 532. Other authors, both Indian and foreign have put the figure close to 600. The personnel injured in the combat ranges from 1,000 to 1,400. Similar count of Pakistan army losses has been somewhat more difficult to figure out. The <a href="/wiki/United_States_Department_of_State.html" title="United States Department of State">US Department of State</a> had made an early, partial estimate of close to 700 fatalities. After the end of the war, this figure was revised upwards by scholars as well as authors. Estimates on Pakistan casualties vary wildly given the problems of assessing the number of deaths in the militant ranks. The only concrete numbers stated were from Nawaz Sharif that there were 4,000+ fatalities. At least one other major Pakistani political party, the <a href="/wiki/Pakistan_Peoples_Party.html" title="Pakistan Peoples Party">PPP</a>, assesses the casualties to be three thousand soldiers and <a href="/wiki/Irregular_military.html" title="Irregular military">irregulars</a>, as given <a  class="external text" title="http://www.ppp.org.pk/articles/article30.htm">on their website</a>. The number of people injured in the Pakistan camp is not yet known. While one Indian Pilot was officially a Prisoner during the fighting, there were eight Pakistani soldiers were taken POW during the fighting and repatriated on 13 Aug 1999 <sup id="_ref-49" class="reference"><a  title="">[54]</a></sup>.</p>
