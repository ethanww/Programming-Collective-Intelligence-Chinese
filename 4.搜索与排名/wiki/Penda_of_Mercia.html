<h2>Descent, beginning of reign, and battle with the West Saxons</h2>
<p>Penda was a son of <a href="/wiki/Pybba_of_Mercia.html" title="Pybba of Mercia">Pybba</a> and said to be a descendant of <a href="/wiki/Icel.html" title="Icel">Icel</a>, with a lineage purportedly extending back to <a href="/wiki/Woden.html" title="Woden">Woden</a>. The <i><a href="/wiki/Anglo-Saxon_Chronicle.html" title="Anglo-Saxon Chronicle">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</a></i> gives his descent as follows:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Penda was Pybba's offspring, Pybba was <a href="/wiki/Creoda_of_Mercia.html" title="Creoda of Mercia">Cryda</a>'s offspring, Cryda <a href="/wiki/Cynewald.html" title="Cynewald">Cynewald</a>'s offspring, Cynewald <a href="/wiki/Cnebba.html" title="Cnebba">Cnebba</a>'s offspring, Cnebba Icel's offspring, Icel <a href="/wiki/Eomer.html" title="Eomer">Eomer</a>'s offspring, Eomer <a href="/wiki/Angeltheow.html" title="Angeltheow">Angeltheow</a>'s offspring, Angeltheow <a href="/wiki/Offa_of_Angeln.html" title="Offa of Angeln">Offa</a>'s offspring, Offa <a href="/wiki/Wermund.html" title="Wermund">Wermund</a>'s offspring, Wermund Wihtlaeg's offspring, Wihtlaeg Woden's offspring.<span class="reference"><sup id="fn_3_back"><a  title="">3</a></sup></span></dd>
</dl>
<p>The <i><a href="/wiki/Historia_Brittonum.html" title="Historia Brittonum">Historia Brittonum</a></i> says that Pybba had twelve sons, including Penda, but that Penda and <a href="/wiki/Eowa_of_Mercia.html" title="Eowa of Mercia">Eowa</a> were those best known to its author.<span class="reference"><sup id="fn_4_back"><a  title="">4</a></sup></span> (Many of these twelve sons of Pybba may in fact merely represent later attempts to claim descent from him.<span class="reference"><sup id="fn_5_back"><a  title="">5</a></sup></span>) Besides Eowa, apparently Penda also had a brother named Coenwalh, from whom two later kings were descended.</p>
<p>The time at which Penda became king is uncertain, as are the circumstances. Another Mercian king, <a href="/wiki/Cearl_of_Mercia.html" title="Cearl of Mercia">Cearl</a>, is mentioned by <a href="/wiki/Bede.html" title="Bede">Bede</a> as ruling at the same time as the Northumbrian king <a href="/wiki/%C3%86thelfrith_of_Northumbria.html" title="Æthelfrith of Northumbria">Æthelfrith</a>, in the early part of the 7th century. Whether Penda immediately succeeded Cearl is unknown, and it is also unclear whether they were related, and if so how closely; <a href="/wiki/Henry_of_Huntingdon.html" title="Henry of Huntingdon">Henry of Huntingdon</a>, writing in the <a href="/wiki/12th_century.html" title="12th century">12th century</a>, claimed that Cearl was a kinsman of Pybba.<span class="reference"><sup id="fn_6_back"><a  title="">6</a></sup></span> It is also possible that Cearl and Penda were dynastic rivals.<span class="reference"><sup id="fn_7_back"><a  title="">7</a></sup></span></p>
<p>According to the <i>Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</i>, Penda became king in <a href="/wiki/626.html" title="626">626</a>, ruled for thirty years, and was fifty years old at the time of his accession.<span class="reference"><sup id="fn_3_back"><a  title="">3</a></sup></span> That he ruled for thirty years should perhaps not be taken as an exact figure,<span class="reference"><sup id="fn_8_back"><a  title="">8</a></sup></span> since the same source says he died in <a href="/wiki/655.html" title="655">655</a>, which would not exactly correspond to the year it gives for the beginning of his reign unless it is considering him to have died in the thirtieth year of his reign.<span class="reference"><sup id="fn_9_back"><a  title="">9</a></sup></span> Furthermore, that Penda was truly fifty years old at the beginning of his reign has generally been considered doubtful by historians, mainly because of the ages of his children—the idea that Penda, at about eighty years of age, would have left behind children who were still young (his son <a href="/wiki/Wulfhere_of_Mercia.html" title="Wulfhere of Mercia">Wulfhere</a> was still young three years after Penda's death, according to Bede) has been widely considered implausible.<span class="reference"><sup id="fn_10_back"><a  title="">10</a></sup></span> The possibility has been suggested that the <i>Chronicle</i> actually meant to say that Penda was fifty years old at the time of his death, and therefore about twenty in 626.<span class="reference"><sup id="fn_11_back"><a  title="">11</a></sup></span></p>

</div>
</div>
<p>Bede, in his <i><a href="/wiki/Historia_ecclesiastica_gentis_Anglorum.html" title="Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum">Ecclesiastical History of the English People</a></i>, says of Penda that he was "a most warlike man of the royal race of the Mercians" and that, following Edwin of Northumbria's defeat in 633 (<i>see</i> <a  title="">below</a>), he ruled the Mercians for twenty-two years with varying fortune.<span class="reference"><sup id="fn_12_back"><a  title="">12</a></sup></span> The noted <a href="/wiki/20th_century.html" title="20th century">20th century</a> historian <a href="/wiki/Frank_Stenton.html" title="Frank Stenton">Frank Stenton</a> was of the opinion that the language used by Bede "leaves no doubt that ... Penda, though descended from the royal family of the Mercians, only became their king after Edwin's defeat".<span class="reference"><sup id="fn_13_back"><a  title="">13</a></sup></span> The <i>Historia Brittonum</i> accords Penda a reign of only ten years,<span class="reference"><sup id="fn_14_back"><a  title="">14</a></sup></span> perhaps dating it from the time of the Battle of Maserfield (<i>see</i> <a  title="">below</a>) around <a href="/wiki/642.html" title="642">642</a>, although according to the generally accepted chronology this would still be more than ten years.<span class="reference"><sup id="fn_9_back"><a  title="">9</a></sup></span> Given the apparent problems with the dates given by the <i>Chronicle</i> and the <i>Historia</i>, Bede's account of the length of Penda's reign is generally considered the most plausible by historians. <a href="/wiki/Nicholas_Brooks.html" title="Nicholas Brooks">Nicholas Brooks</a> noted that, since these three accounts of the length of Penda's reign come from three different sources, and none of them are Mercian (they are <a href="/wiki/West_Saxon.html" title="West Saxon">West Saxon</a>, <a href="/wiki/Northumbria.html" title="Northumbria">Northumbrian</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Welsh_people.html" title="Welsh people">Welsh</a>), they may merely reflect the times at which their respective peoples first had military involvement with Penda.<span class="reference"><sup id="fn_8_back"><a  title="">8</a></sup></span></p>
<p>The question of whether or not Penda was already king during the late <a href="/wiki/620s.html" title="620s">620s</a> assumes greater significance in light of the <i>Chronicle</i>'s record of a battle between Penda and the West Saxons under their kings <a href="/wiki/Cynegils_of_Wessex.html" title="Cynegils of Wessex">Cynegils</a> and <a href="/wiki/Cwichelm_of_Wessex.html" title="Cwichelm of Wessex">Cwichelm</a> taking place at <a href="/wiki/Cirencester.html" title="Cirencester">Cirencester</a> in <a href="/wiki/628.html" title="628">628</a>.<span class="reference"><sup id="fn_15_back"><a  title="">15</a></sup></span> If he was not yet king, then his involvement in this conflict might indicate that he was fighting as an independent <a href="/wiki/Warlord.html" title="Warlord">warlord</a> during this period—as Stenton put it, "a landless noble of the Mercian royal house fighting for his own hand."<span class="reference"><sup id="fn_16_back"><a  title="">16</a></sup></span> On the other hand, he might have been one of multiple rulers among the Mercians at the time, ruling only a part of their territory. The <i>Chronicle</i> says that after the battle, Penda and the West Saxons "came to an agreement."<span class="reference"><sup id="fn_17_back"><a  title="">17</a></sup></span> It has been speculated that this agreement marked a victory for Penda, ceding to him Cirencester and the areas along the lower <a href="/wiki/River_Severn.html" title="River Severn">River Severn</a>.<span class="reference"><sup id="fn_16_back"><a  title="">16</a></sup></span> These lands, to the southwest of Mercia, had apparently been taken by the West Saxons from the <a href="/wiki/Brythonic.html" title="Brythonic">British</a> in <a href="/wiki/577.html" title="577">577</a>,<span class="reference"><sup id="fn_18_back"><a  title="">18</a></sup></span> and the territory eventually became part of the subkingdom of the <a href="/wiki/Hwicce.html" title="Hwicce">Hwicce</a>. Given Penda's role in the area at this time and his apparent success there, it has been argued that the subkingdom of the Hwicce was established by him; evidence to support this is lacking, although the subkingdom is known to have existed later in the century.<span class="reference"><sup id="fn_19_back"><a  title="">19</a></sup></span></p>

<dl>

</dl>
<p>At some point in the late <a href="/wiki/620s.html" title="620s">620s</a> or early <a href="/wiki/630s.html" title="630s">630s</a>, <a href="/wiki/Cadwallon_ap_Cadfan.html" title="Cadwallon ap Cadfan">Cadwallon ap Cadfan</a>, the British (Welsh) king of <a href="/wiki/Kingdom_of_Gwynedd.html" title="Kingdom of Gwynedd">Gwynedd</a>, became involved in a war with Edwin of Northumbria, the most powerful king in Britain at the time. Cadwallon apparently was initially unsuccessful, but he joined with Penda, who is thought to have been the lesser partner in their alliance,<span class="reference"><sup id="fn_20_back"><a  title="">20</a></sup></span> to defeat the Northumbrians in October <a href="/wiki/633.html" title="633">633</a><span class="reference"><sup id="fn_2_back"><a  title="">2</a></sup></span> at the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Hatfield_Chase.html" title="Battle of Hatfield Chase">Battle of Hatfield Chase</a>. Penda was probably not yet king of the Mercians at this time, but he is thought to have become king soon afterwards, based on Bede's characterisation of his position. Edwin was killed in the battle, and one of his sons, Eadfrith, fell into Penda's hands.<span class="reference"><sup id="fn_11_back"><a  title="">11</a></sup></span></p>
<p>One manuscript of the <i>Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</i> says that, following the victory at Hatfield Chase, Cadwallon and Penda went on to ravage "the whole land" of the Northumbrians.<span class="reference"><sup id="fn_21_back"><a  title="">21</a></sup></span> Certainly Cadwallon continued the war, but the extent of Penda's further participation is uncertain. Bede says that the <a href="/wiki/Pagans.html" title="Pagans">pagans</a> who had slain Edwin—presumably a reference to the Mercians under Penda, although conceivably it could be a derisive misnomer meant to refer to the Christian British—burned a church and town at <a  class="new" title="Campodonum">Campodonum</a>,<span class="reference"><sup id="fn_22_back"><a  title="">22</a></sup></span> although the time at which this occurred is uncertain. Penda may have withdrawn from the war at some point before the defeat and death of Cadwallon at the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Heavenfield.html" title="Battle of Heavenfield">Battle of Heavenfield</a>, about a year after Hatfield Chase, since he was not present at this battle; furthermore, Bede makes no mention of Penda's presence in the preceding siege and battle in which <a href="/wiki/Osric_of_Deira.html" title="Osric of Deira">Osric of Deira</a> was defeated and killed. Penda's successful participation in the battle of Hatfield Chase may have elevated his status among the Mercians and enabled him to become king, and he may have withdrawn from the war prior to Heavenfield in order to secure or consolidate his position in Mercia. Referring to Penda's successes against the West Saxons and the Northumbrians, <a  class="new" title="D. P. Kirby">D. P. Kirby</a> writes of Penda's emergence in these years as "a Mercian leader whose military exploits far transcended those of his obscure predecessors."<span class="reference"><sup id="fn_9_back"><a  title="">9</a></sup></span></p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: During the reign of Oswald">edit</a>]</div>

<h2>During the reign of Oswald</h2>
<p><a href="/wiki/Oswald_of_Northumbria.html" title="Oswald of Northumbria">Oswald of Bernicia</a> became king of Northumbria after his victory over Cadwallon at Heavenfield.<span class="reference"><sup id="fn_11_back"><a  title="">11</a></sup></span> Penda's status and activities during the years of Oswald's reign are obscure, and various interpretations of Penda's position during this period have been suggested. It has been presumed that Penda acknowledged Oswald's authority in some sense after Heavenfield, although Penda was probably an obstacle to Northumbrian supremacy south of the <a href="/wiki/Humber.html" title="Humber">Humber</a>.<span class="reference"><sup id="fn_23_back"><a  title="">23</a></sup></span> It has been suggested that Penda's strength during Oswald's reign could be exaggerated by the historical awareness of his later successes.<span class="reference"><sup id="fn_24_back"><a  title="">24</a></sup></span> Kirby says that, while Oswald was as powerful as Edwin had been, "he faced a more entrenched challenge in midland and eastern England from Penda".<span class="reference"><sup id="fn_25_back"><a  title="">25</a></sup></span> Oswald's moves toward alliance with the West Saxons, who occupied territory to the south of the Mercians, could be seen as an attempt to counter Mercian power.</p>
<p>At some point during Oswald's reign, Penda had Edwin's son Eadfrith killed, "contrary to his oath".<span class="reference"><sup id="fn_11_back"><a  title="">11</a></sup></span> The possibility that his killing was the result of pressure from Oswald—Eadfrith being a dynastic rival of Oswald—has been suggested;<span class="reference"><sup id="fn_23_back"><a  title="">23</a></sup></span> since the potential existed for Eadfrith to be put to use in Mercia's favour in Northumbrian power struggles while he was alive, it may not have been to Penda's advantage to have him killed.<span class="reference"><sup id="fn_26_back"><a  title="">26</a></sup></span> On the other hand, Penda may have killed Eadfrith for his own reasons. It has been suggested that Penda may have been concerned that Eadfrith could be a threat to him because Eadfrith might seek vengeance for the deaths of his father and brother;<span class="reference"><sup id="fn_27_back"><a  title="">27</a></sup></span> it is also possible that Mercian dynastic rivalry played a part in the killing, since Eadfrith was a grandson of Penda's predecessor Cearl.<span class="reference"><sup id="fn_7_back"><a  title="">7</a></sup></span><sup>,</sup><span class="reference"><sup id="fn_27_back"><a  title="">27</a></sup></span></p>
<p>It was probably at some point during Oswald's reign that Penda fought with the East Angles and defeated them, killing their king <a href="/wiki/Egric_of_East_Anglia.html" title="Egric of East Anglia">Egric</a> and the former king <a  class="new" title="Sigebert of East Anglia">Sigebert</a>, who had been brought out of retirement in a monastery against his will in the belief that his presence would motivate the soldiers.<span class="reference"><sup id="fn_28_back"><a  title="">28</a></sup></span> The time at which the battle occurred is uncertain; it may have been as early as <a href="/wiki/635.html" title="635">635</a>, but there is also evidence to suggest it could not have been before <a href="/wiki/640.html" title="640">640</a> or <a href="/wiki/641.html" title="641">641</a>.<span class="reference"><sup id="fn_29_back"><a  title="">29</a></sup></span> Presuming that this battle took place before the Battle of Maserfield, it may have been that such an expression of Penda's ambition and emerging power made Oswald feel that Penda had to be defeated in order for Northumbrian dominance of southern England to be secured or consolidated.<span class="reference"><sup id="fn_25_back"><a  title="">25</a></sup></span></p>
<p>Penda's brother Eowa was also said by the <i>Historia Brittonum</i><span class="reference"><sup id="fn_13_back"><a  title="">13</a></sup></span> and the <i><a href="/wiki/Annales_Cambriae.html" title="Annales Cambriae">Annales Cambriae</a></i> to have been a king of the Mercians at the time of Maserfield. The question of what sort of relationship of power existed between the brothers prior to the battle is a matter of speculation. Eowa may have simply been a sub-king under Penda and it is also possible that Penda and Eowa ruled jointly during the <a href="/wiki/630s.html" title="630s">630s</a> and early <a href="/wiki/640s.html" title="640s">640s</a>, and joint kingships were not uncommon among Anglo-Saxon kingdoms of the period. They may have ruled the southern and northern Mercians respectively.<span class="reference"><sup id="fn_26_back"><a  title="">26</a></sup></span> That Penda ruled the southern part is a possibility suggested by his early involvement in the area of the Hwicce, to the south of Mercia, as well as by the fact that, after Penda's death, his son <a href="/wiki/Peada_of_Mercia.html" title="Peada of Mercia">Peada</a> was allowed to rule southern Mercia while the northern part was placed under direct Northumbrian control—this may indicate a special hereditary claim over southern Mercia by Penda's line that it did not have over the north.</p>
<p>Another possibility was suggested by Brooks: Penda might have lost power at some point after Heavenfield, and Eowa may have actually been ruling the Mercians for at least some of the period as a subject ally or puppet of Oswald. Brooks cited Bede's statement implying that Penda's fortunes were mixed during his twenty-two years in power and noted the possibility that Penda's fortunes were low at this time.<span class="reference"><sup id="fn_30_back"><a  title="">30</a></sup></span> Thus it may be that Penda was not consistently the dominant figure in Mercia during the years between Hatfield and Maserfield.</p>

</dl>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/August_5.html" title="August 5">August 5</a>, <a href="/wiki/642.html" title="642">642</a>,<span class="reference"><sup id="fn_31_back"><a  title="">31</a></sup></span> Penda defeated the Northumbrians at the Battle of Maserfield, which was fought near the lands of the Welsh, and Oswald was killed. Surviving <a href="/wiki/Welsh_poetry.html" title="Welsh poetry">Welsh poetry</a> suggests that Penda fought in alliance with the men of <a href="/wiki/Kingdom_of_Powys.html" title="Kingdom of Powys">Powys</a>—apparently he was consistently allied with some of the Welsh—perhaps including <a  class="new" title="Cynddylan ap Cyndrwyn">Cynddylan ap Cyndrwyn</a>, of whom it was said that "when the son of Pyb desired, how ready he was", presumably meaning that he was an ally of Penda, the son of Pybba.<span class="reference"><sup id="fn_32_back"><a  title="">32</a></sup></span> If the traditional identification of the battle's location with <a href="/wiki/Oswestry.html" title="Oswestry">Oswestry</a> is correct, then this would indicate that it was Oswald who had taken the offensive against Penda; it has been suggested that he was acting against "a threat posed to his domination of Mercia by a hostile alliance of Penda and Powys."<span class="reference"><sup id="fn_33_back"><a  title="">33</a></sup></span> According to <a href="/wiki/Reginald_of_Durham.html" title="Reginald of Durham">Reginald of Durham</a>'s 12th century <i><a  class="new" title="Vita Sancti Oswaldi">Life of Saint Oswald</a></i>, Penda fled into Wales prior to the battle, at which point Oswald felt secure and sent his army away; this explanation of events has been regarded as "plausible" but is not found in any other source, and may therefore have been Reginald's invention.<span class="reference"><sup id="fn_34_back"><a  title="">34</a></sup></span></p>
<p>According to Bede, Penda had Oswald's body dismembered, with his head, hands and arms being placed onto stakes <span class="reference"><sup id="fn_35_back"><a  title="">35</a></sup></span> (this may have had a pagan religious significance<span class="reference"><sup id="fn_36_back"><a  title="">36</a></sup></span>); Oswald thereafter came to be revered as a <a href="/wiki/Saint.html" title="Saint">saint</a>, with his death in battle as a Christian king against pagans leading him to be regarded as a <a href="/wiki/Martyr.html" title="Martyr">martyr</a>.</p>
<p>Eowa was killed at Maserfield along with Oswald,<span class="reference"><sup id="fn_13_back"><a  title="">13</a></sup></span> although on which side he fought is unknown. It may well be that he fought as a dependent ally of Oswald against Penda. If Eowa was in fact dominant among the Mercians during the period leading up to the battle, then his death could have marked what the author of the <i>Historia Brittonum</i> regarded as the beginning of Penda's ten-year reign.<span class="reference"><sup id="fn_10_back"><a  title="">10</a></sup></span> Thus it may be that Penda prevailed not only over the Northumbrians but also over his rivals among the Mercians.</p>
<p>The <i>Historia Brittonum</i> may also be referring to this battle when it says that Penda first freed (<i>separavit</i>) the Mercians from the Northumbrians. This may be an important clue to the relationship between the Mercians and the Northumbrians prior to and during Penda's time. There may have existed a "Humbrian confederacy" that included the Mercians until Penda broke free of it.<span class="reference"><sup id="fn_37_back"><a  title="">37</a></sup></span> On the other hand, it has been considered unlikely that this was truly the first instance of their separation: it is significant that Cearl had married his daughter to Edwin during Edwin's exile, when Edwin was an enemy of the Northumbrian king <a href="/wiki/%C3%86thelfrith_of_Northumbria.html" title="Æthelfrith of Northumbria">Æthelfrith</a>. It would seem that if Cearl was able to do this, he was not subject to Æthelfrith;<span class="reference"><sup id="fn_11_back"><a  title="">11</a></sup></span> thus it may be that any subject relationship only developed after the time of this marriage.<span class="reference"><sup id="fn_37_back"><a  title="">37</a></sup></span></p>
<p>The battle left Penda with a degree of power unprecedented for a Mercian king—Kirby called him "without question the most powerful Mercian ruler so far to have emerged in the midlands" after Maserfield<span class="reference"><sup id="fn_25_back"><a  title="">25</a></sup></span>—and the prestige and status associated with defeating the powerful Oswald must have been very significant. Northumbria was greatly weakened as a consequence of the battle; the kingdom became fractured to some degree between <a href="/wiki/Deira.html" title="Deira">Deira</a> in its southern part and Bernicia in the north, with the Deirans acquiring a king of their own, <a href="/wiki/Oswine_of_Deira.html" title="Oswine of Deira">Oswine</a>, while in Bernicia, Oswald was succeeded by his brother, <a href="/wiki/Oswiu_of_Northumbria.html" title="Oswiu of Northumbria">Oswiu</a>. Mercia thus enjoyed a greatly enhanced position of strength relative to the surrounding kingdoms, and Stenton wrote that the battle left Penda as "the most formidable king in England", and observed that although "there is no evidence that he ever became, or even tried to become, the lord of all the other kings of southern England ... none of them can have been his equal in reputation".<span class="reference"><sup id="fn_38_back"><a  title="">38</a></sup></span></p>

<h2>Campaigns between Maserfield and the Winwaed</h2>
<p>Defeat at Maserfield must have weakened Northumbrian influence over the West Saxons, and the new West Saxon king <a href="/wiki/Cenwealh_of_Wessex.html" title="Cenwealh of Wessex">Cenwealh</a>—who was still pagan at this time—was married to Penda's sister. It may be surmised that this meant he was to some extent within what Kirby called a "Mercian orbit".<span class="reference"><sup id="fn_39_back"><a  title="">39</a></sup></span> However, when Cenwealh (according to Bede) "repudiated" Penda's sister in favour of another wife, Penda drove Cenwealh into exile in East Anglia in <a href="/wiki/645.html" title="645">645</a>, where he remained for three years before regaining power.<span class="reference"><sup id="fn_40_back"><a  title="">40</a></sup></span> Who governed the West Saxons during the years of Cenwealh's exile is unknown; Kirby considered it reasonable to conclude that whoever ruled was subject to Penda. He also suggested that Cenwealh may not have been able to return to his kingdom until after Penda's death.<span class="reference"><sup id="fn_39_back"><a  title="">39</a></sup></span></p>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/654.html" title="654">654</a>,<span class="reference"><sup id="fn_3_back"><a  title="">3</a></sup></span> the East Anglian king <a href="/wiki/Anna_of_East_Anglia.html" title="Anna of East Anglia">Anna</a>, who had harboured the exiled Cenwealh, was killed by Penda. He was succeeded by a brother, <a href="/wiki/Aethelhere_of_East_Anglia.html" title="Aethelhere of East Anglia">Aethelhere</a>; since Aethelhere was subsequently a participant in Penda's doomed invasion of Bernicia in 655 (<i>see</i> <a  title="">below</a>), it may be that Penda installed Aethelhere in power.<span class="reference"><sup id="fn_5_back"><a  title="">5</a></sup></span> It has been suggested that Penda's wars against the East Angles "should be seen in the light of interfactional struggles within East Anglia."<span class="reference"><sup id="fn_41_back"><a  title="">41</a></sup></span> It may also be that Penda made war against the East Angles with the intention of securing Mercian dominance over the area of <a  class="new" title="Middle Anglia">Middle Anglia</a>, where Penda established his son Peada as ruler.</p>
<p>In the years after Maserfield, Penda also destructively waged war against Oswiu of Bernicia on his own territory. At one point prior to the death of Bishop <a href="/wiki/Aidan_of_Lindisfarne.html" title="Aidan of Lindisfarne">Aidan</a> (August 31, 651), Bede says that Penda "cruelly ravaged the country of the Northumbrians far and near" and besieged the royal Bernician stronghold of <a href="/wiki/Bamburgh.html" title="Bamburgh">Bamburgh</a>. When the Mercians were unable to capture it—"not being able to enter it by force, or by a long siege"—Bede reports that they attempted to set the city ablaze, but that it was saved by a sacred wind supposedly sent in response to a plea from the saintly Aidan: "Behold, Lord, how great mischief Penda does!" The wind is said to have blown the fire back towards the Mercians, deterring them from further attempts to capture the city.<span class="reference"><sup id="fn_42_back"><a  title="">42</a></sup></span> At another point, some years after Aidan's death, Bede records another attack: he says that Penda led an army in devastating the area where Aidan died—he "destroyed all he could with fire and sword"—but that when the Mercians burned down the church where Aidan died, the post against which he was leaning at the time of his death was undamaged; this was taken to be a miracle.<span class="reference"><sup id="fn_43_back"><a  title="">43</a></sup></span> No open battles are recorded as being fought between the two sides prior to the Winwaed in 655 (<i>see</i> <a  title="">below</a>), however, and this may mean that Oswiu deliberately avoided battle due to a feeling of weakness relative to Penda. This feeling may have been in religious as well as military terms: N. J. Higham wrote of Penda acquiring "a pre-eminent reputation as a god-protected, warrior–king", whose victories may have led to a belief that his pagan gods were more effective for protection in war than the Christian God.<span class="reference"><sup id="fn_23_back"><a  title="">23</a></sup></span></p>

<h2>Relations with Bernicia; Christianity and Middle Anglia</h2>
<p>Despite these apparent instances of warfare, relations between Penda and Oswiu were probably not entirely hostile during this period, since Penda's daughter <a  class="new" title="Cyneburh">Cyneburh</a> married <a  class="new" title="Alhfrith of Deira">Alhfrith</a>, Oswiu's son, and Penda's son Peada married <a  class="new" title="Alhflaed">Alhflaed</a>, Oswiu's daughter. According to Bede, who dates the events to <a href="/wiki/653.html" title="653">653</a>, the latter marriage was made contingent upon the <a href="/wiki/Baptism.html" title="Baptism">baptism</a> and conversion to Christianity of Peada; Peada accepted this, and the preaching of Christianity began among the Middle Angles, whom he ruled. Bede wrote that Penda tolerated the preaching of Christianity in Mercia itself, despite his own beliefs:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Nor did King Penda obstruct the preaching of the word among his people, the Mercians, if any were willing to hear it; but, on the contrary, he hated and despised those whom he perceived not to perform the works of faith, when they had once received the faith, saying, "They were contemptible and wretched who did not obey their God, in whom they believed." This was begun two years before the death of King Penda.<span class="reference"><sup id="fn_44_back"><a  title="">44</a></sup></span></dd>
</dl>
<p>Peada's conversion and the introduction of priests into Middle Anglia could be seen as evidence of Penda's tolerance of Christianity, given the absence of evidence that he sought to interfere.<span class="reference"><sup id="fn_45_back"><a  title="">45</a></sup></span> On the other hand, an interpretation is also possible whereby the marriage and conversion could be seen as corresponding to a successful attempt on Oswiu's part to expand Bernician influence at Penda's expense; Higham saw Peada's conversion more in terms of political manoeuvring on both sides than religious zeal.<span class="reference"><sup id="fn_46_back"><a  title="">46</a></sup></span></p>
<p>Middle Anglia as a political entity may have been created by Penda as an expression of Mercian power in the area following his victories over the East Angles. Previously there seem to have been a number of small peoples inhabiting the region, and Penda's establishment of Peada as a subking there may have marked their initial union under one ruler. The districts corresponding to <a href="/wiki/Shropshire.html" title="Shropshire">Shropshire</a> and <a href="/wiki/Herefordshire.html" title="Herefordshire">Herefordshire</a>, along Mercia's western frontier near Wales, probably also fell under Mercian domination at this time. Here a king called <a  class="new" title="Merewalh of the Magonsaete">Merewalh</a> ruled over the <a  class="new" title="Magonsaete">Magonsaete</a>; in later centuries it was said that Merewalh was a son of Penda, but this is considered uncertain. Stenton, for example, considered it likely that Merewalh was a representative of a local dynasty that continued to rule under Mercian domination.<span class="reference"><sup id="fn_47_back"><a  title="">47</a></sup></span></p>

</dl>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/655.html" title="655">655</a>,<span class="reference"><sup id="fn_1_back"><a  title="">1</a></sup></span> Penda invaded Bernicia with a large army, reported to have been thirty <a  class="external text" title="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Legion">legions</a> strong, with thirty royal or noble commanders (<i>duces regii</i>, as Bede called them), including rulers such as <a href="/wiki/Cadafael_Cadomedd_ap_Cynfeddw.html" title="Cadafael Cadomedd ap Cynfeddw">Cadafael ap Cynfeddw</a> of Gwynedd and Aethelhere of East Anglia. Penda also enjoyed the support of <a href="/wiki/Aethelwald_of_Deira.html" title="Aethelwald of Deira">Aethelwald</a>, the king of Deira and the successor of Oswine, who had been murdered on Oswiu's orders in <a href="/wiki/651.html" title="651">651</a>; Bede says Aethelwald acted as Penda's guide during his invasion.</p>
<p>The cause of this war is uncertain. There is a passage in Bede's <i>Ecclesiastical History</i> that suggests Aethelhere of East Anglia was the cause of the war, but it has been argued that an issue of punctuation in later manuscripts confused Bede's meaning on this point, and that he in fact meant to refer to Penda as being responsible for the war.<span class="reference"><sup id="fn_48_back"><a  title="">48</a></sup></span> Although, according to Bede, Penda tolerated some Christian preaching in Mercia, it has been suggested that he perceived Bernician sponsorship of Christianity in Mercia and Middle Anglia as a form of "religious colonialism" that undermined his power, and that this may have provoked the war.<span class="reference"><sup id="fn_49_back"><a  title="">49</a></sup></span> Elsewhere the possibility has been suggested that Penda sought to prevent Oswiu from reunifying Northumbria,<span class="reference"><sup id="fn_32_back"><a  title="">32</a></sup></span> not wanting Oswiu to restore the kingdom to the power it had enjoyed under Edwin and Oswald; a perception of the conflict in terms of the political situation between Bernicia and Deira could help to explain the role of Aethelwald of Deira in the war, since Aethelwald was the son of Oswald and might not ordinarily be expected to ally with those who had killed his father. Perhaps, as the son of Oswald, he sought to obtain the Bernician kingship for himself.<span class="reference"><sup id="fn_49_back"><a  title="">49</a></sup></span></p>
<p>According to the <i>Historia Brittonum</i>, Penda besieged Oswiu at Iudeu;<span class="reference"><sup id="fn_13_back"><a  title="">13</a></sup></span> this site has been identified with <a href="/wiki/Stirling.html" title="Stirling">Stirling</a>, in the north of Oswiu's kingdom.<span class="reference"><sup id="fn_50_back"><a  title="">50</a></sup></span> Oswiu tried to buy peace: in the <i>Historia Brittonum</i>, it is said that Oswiu offered treasure, which Penda distributed among his British allies;<span class="reference"><sup id="fn_13_back"><a  title="">13</a></sup></span> Bede states that the offer was simply rejected by Penda, who "resolved to extirpate all of [Oswiu's] nation, from the highest to the lowest". Additionally, according to Bede, Oswiu's son <a href="/wiki/Ecgfrith_of_Northumbria.html" title="Ecgfrith of Northumbria">Ecgfrith</a> was being held hostage "at the court of Queen <a  class="new" title="Cynwise">Cynwise</a>, in the province of the Mercians"<span class="reference"><sup id="fn_51_back"><a  title="">51</a></sup></span>—perhaps surrendered by Oswiu as part of some negotiations or arrangement. It would seem that Penda's army then moved back south, perhaps returning home,<span class="reference"><sup id="fn_52_back"><a  title="">52</a></sup></span> but a great battle was fought near the river Winwaed (the identification of the Winwaed with a modern river is uncertain, although the <a  class="new" title="River Went">River Went</a> is a possibility) on a date given by Bede as <a href="/wiki/November_15.html" title="November 15">November 15</a>. It may be that Penda's army was attacked by Oswiu at a point of strategic vulnerability, which would help explain Oswiu's victory over forces that were, according to Bede, much larger than his own.<span class="reference"><sup id="fn_53_back"><a  title="">53</a></sup></span></p>
<p>The Mercian force was also weakened by desertions: according to the <i>Historia Brittonum</i>, Cadafael of Gwynedd, "rising up in the night, escaped together with his army" (thus earning him the name <i>Cadomedd</i>, or "battle-shirker"),<span class="reference"><sup id="fn_13_back"><a  title="">13</a></sup></span> and Bede says that at the time of the battle, Aethelwald of Deira withdrew and "awaited the outcome from a place of safety".<span class="reference"><sup id="fn_51_back"><a  title="">51</a></sup></span> If Penda's army was marching home, it may have been for this reason that some of his allies were unwilling to fight, according to Kirby; it may also be that the allies had different purposes in the war, and Kirby suggested that Penda's deserting allies may have been dissatisfied "with what had been achieved at <i>Iudeu</i>".<span class="reference"><sup id="fn_52_back"><a  title="">52</a></sup></span> At a time when the Winwaed was swollen with heavy rains, the Mercians were badly defeated and Penda was killed, along with the East Anglian king Aethelhere. Bede says that Penda's "thirty commanders, and those who had come to his assistance were put to flight, and almost all of them slain," and that more drowned while fleeing than were killed in the actual battle. He also says that Penda's head was cut off; a connection between this and the treatment of Oswald's body at Maserfield is possible.<span class="reference"><sup id="fn_52_back"><a  title="">52</a></sup></span> Writing in the <a href="/wiki/12th_century.html" title="12th century">12th century</a>, <a href="/wiki/Henry_of_Huntingdon.html" title="Henry of Huntingdon">Henry of Huntingdon</a> emphasised the idea that Penda was suffering the same fate as he had inflicted on others.<span class="reference"><sup id="fn_53_back"><a  title="">53</a></sup></span></p>

<h2>Aftermath and historical appraisal</h2>
<p>With the defeat at the Winwaed, Oswiu came to briefly dominate Mercia, permitting Penda's son Peada to rule its southern portion. Two of Penda's other sons, <a href="/wiki/Wulfhere_of_Mercia.html" title="Wulfhere of Mercia">Wulfhere</a> and <a href="/wiki/Aethelred_of_Mercia.html" title="Aethelred of Mercia">Aethelred</a>, later ruled Mercia in succession after the overthrow of Northumbrian control in the late <a href="/wiki/650s.html" title="650s">650s</a>. The period of rule by Penda's descendants came to an end with his grandson <a href="/wiki/Ceolred_of_Mercia.html" title="Ceolred of Mercia">Ceolred</a>'s death in <a href="/wiki/716.html" title="716">716</a>, after which power passed to descendants of Eowa for most of the remainder of the <a href="/wiki/8th_century.html" title="8th century">8th century</a>.</p>
<p>Penda's reign is significant in that it marks an emergence from the obscurity of Mercia during the time of his predecessors, both in terms of the power of the Mercians relative to the surrounding peoples and in terms of our historical awareness of them. While our understanding of Penda's reign is quite unclear, and even the very notable and decisive battles he fought are surrounded by historical confusion, for the first time a general outline of important events regarding the Mercians becomes realistically possible. Furthermore, Penda was certainly of great importance to the development of the Mercian kingdom; it has been said that his reign was "crucial to the consolidation and expansion of Mercia".<span class="reference"><sup id="fn_24_back"><a  title="">24</a></sup></span></p>
<p>Penda was the last great pagan warrior-king among the Anglo-Saxons. Higham wrote that "his destruction sounded the death-knell of English paganism as a political ideology and public religion."<span class="reference"><sup id="fn_23_back"><a  title="">23</a></sup></span> After Penda's death, the Mercians were converted to Christianity, and all three of Penda's reigning sons ruled as Christians. His daughters <a  class="new" title="Cyneburh">Cyneburh</a> and <a  class="new" title="Cyneswith">Cyneswith</a> became Christian and were saintly figures who according to some accounts retained their virginity through their marriages. There was purportedly even an infant grandson of Penda named <a href="/wiki/Rumwold.html" title="Rumwold">Rumwold</a> who lived a saintly three-day life of fervent preaching. What is known about Penda is primarily derived from the history written by the Northumbrian Bede, a priest not inclined to objectively portray a pagan Mercian who engaged in fierce conflict with Christian kings, and in particular with Northumbrian rulers; indeed, Penda has been described as "the villain of Bede's third book" (of the <i>Historia Ecclesiastica</i>).<span class="reference"><sup id="fn_55_back"><a  title="">55</a></sup></span> From the perspective of the Christians who later wrote about Penda, the important theme that dominates their descriptions is the religious context of his wars—for instance, the <i>Historia Brittonum</i> says that Penda prevailed at Maserfield through "diabolical agency"<span class="reference"><sup id="fn_14_back"><a  title="">14</a></sup></span>—but Penda's greatest importance was perhaps in his opposition to the supremacy of the Northumbrians. According to Stenton, had it not been for Penda's resistance, "a loosely compacted kingdom of England under Northumbrian rule would probably have been established by the middle of the seventh century."<span class="reference"><sup id="fn_56_back"><a  title="">56</a></sup></span> In summarising Penda, he wrote the following:</p>

<dd>He was himself a great fighting king of the kind most honoured in Germanic saga; the lord of many princes, and the leader of a vast retinue attracted to his service by his success and generosity. Many stories must have been told about his dealings with other kings, but none of them have survived; his wars can only be described from the standpoint of his enemies...<span class="reference"><sup id="fn_57_back"><a  title="">57</a></sup></span></dd>

<ul>
<li><cite id="fn_1"><a  title="">Note 1</a>:</cite> Manuscript A of the <i><a href="/wiki/Anglo-Saxon_Chronicle.html" title="Anglo-Saxon Chronicle">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</a></i> gives the year as 655. Bede also gives the year as 655 and specifies a date, November 15. R. L. Poole (<i>Studies in Chronology and History</i>, 1934) put forward the theory that Bede began his year in September, and consequently November 655 would actually fall in 654; Frank Stenton also dated events accordingly in his <i>Anglo-Saxon England</i> (1943).<small><sup><a  title="">1</a></sup></small> Others have accepted Bede's given dates as meaning what they appear to mean, considering Bede's year to have begun on <a href="/wiki/December_25.html" title="December 25">December 25</a> or <a href="/wiki/January_1.html" title="January 1">January 1</a> (see S. Wood, 1983: "Bede's Northumbrian dates again"). The historian D. P. Kirby suggested the year <a href="/wiki/656.html" title="656">656</a> as a possibility, alongside 655, in case the dates given by Bede are off by one year (see Kirby's "Bede and Northumbrian Chronology", 1963). The <i><a href="/wiki/Annales_Cambriae.html" title="Annales Cambriae">Annales Cambriae</a></i> gives the year as <a href="/wiki/657.html" title="657">657</a>. <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/annalescambriae.html">[1]</a></li>
<li><cite id="fn_2"><a  title="">Note 2</a>:</cite> Bede gives the year of Hatfield as 633 (along with the <i>Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</i>); if the theory that Bede's years began in September is employed (see Note 1), then October 633 would actually be in 632, and this dating has sometimes been observed by modern historians such as Stenton (see Note 8). Kirby suggested that the year may have actually been <a href="/wiki/634.html" title="634">634</a>, accounting for the possibility that Bede's dates are one year early (see Note 1). Bede gives the specific date of Hatfield as October 12; Manuscript E of the <i>Chronicle</i> (see Note 10) gives it as October 14.</li>

<li><cite id="fn_29"><a  title="">Note 29</a>:</cite> Kirby (Ch. 5, Note 26, page 207)<small><sup><a  title="">4</a></sup></small> explains some of the uncertainty surrounding the time of this battle: one source says that Anna died in the 19th year of his reign, in which case his reign would have begun around 635 and therefore the battle that killed his predecessor would also have been at about the same time; however, another source indicates that the ex-king Sigebert was still alive at least in 640 or 641.</li>
<li><cite id="fn_30"><a  title="">Note 30</a>:</cite> Brooks, pages 166–67,<small><sup><a  title="">7</a></sup></small> argues against the idea that Penda and Eowa were co-rulers, and favours the idea that Eowa was ruling Mercia from <i>c</i>. 635 until 642.</li>
<li><cite id="fn_31"><a  title="">Note 31</a>:</cite> The date of Maserfield is subject to a similar sort of uncertainty as that which surrounds the dates of the battles of Hatfield Chase and the Winwaed. Manuscript A of the <i>Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</i> (see Note 1) gives the year as 642, as does Bede; however, if Hatfield actually occurred in 632 (see Note 2), then that would mean Maserfield occurred in 641. D. P. Kirby has suggested 643 as a possibility, allowing for Bede's chronology being one year early (see Note 1). The <i>Annales Cambriae</i> give the year as 644. Bede and the <i>Chronicle</i> (Manuscript E) agree that the date was August 5.</li>
