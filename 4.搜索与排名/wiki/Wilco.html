<h2>Band history</h2>
<p>Primary <a href="/wiki/Songwriter.html" title="Songwriter">songwriter</a>/<a href="/wiki/Singer.html" title="Singer">singer</a> <a href="/wiki/Jeff_Tweedy.html" title="Jeff Tweedy">Jeff Tweedy</a> was a member of the seminal <a href="/wiki/1980s.html" title="1980s">1980s</a> and <a href="/wiki/1990s.html" title="1990s">1990s</a> <a href="/wiki/Alt-country.html" title="Alt-country">alt-country</a> group <a href="/wiki/Uncle_Tupelo.html" title="Uncle Tupelo">Uncle Tupelo</a>. Tweedy shared songwriting and singing duties with bandmate <a href="/wiki/Jay_Farrar.html" title="Jay Farrar">Jay Farrar</a>, who later formed <a href="/wiki/Son_Volt.html" title="Son Volt">Son Volt</a>. Tweedy formed Wilco with the last incarnation of Uncle Tupelo&#160;: <a href="/wiki/Drummer.html" title="Drummer">drummer</a> <a href="/wiki/Ken_Coomer.html" title="Ken Coomer">Ken Coomer</a>, <a href="/wiki/Bassist.html" title="Bassist">bassist</a> <a href="/wiki/John_Stirratt.html" title="John Stirratt">John Stirratt</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Stringed_instrument.html" title="Stringed instrument">string</a> player <a href="/wiki/Max_Johnston.html" title="Max Johnston">Max Johnston</a>. They had been featured on the last Uncle Tupelo recording "<a href="/wiki/Anodyne.html" title="Anodyne">Anodyne</a>". The band was named after the <a href="/wiki/Voice_procedure.html" title="Voice procedure">voice procedure</a> term "Roger Wilco", an expression that means "<b>R</b>eceived, <b>Wil</b>l <b>Co</b>mply". Jeff also once noted that when Jay Farrar left Uncle Tupelo, Jeff was left with nothing to do but comply. Hence, "Will comply--Wilco."</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: A.M. &amp; Being There">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="A.M._.26_Being_There" id="A.M._.26_Being_There"></a></p>
<h3><i>A.M.</i> &amp; <i>Being There</i></h3>
<p>Wilco has steadily gained popularity since its first release <i><a href="/wiki/A.M._%28album%29.html" title="A.M. (album)">A.M.</a></i> in <a href="/wiki/1995.html" title="1995">1995</a>, the only one of the band's albums that resembles the former Uncle Tupelo sound. Produced by Brian Paulson and lead guitar work done by <a href="/wiki/The_Bottle_Rockets.html" title="The Bottle Rockets">Bottle Rockets'</a> frontman <a href="/wiki/Brian_Henneman.html" title="Brian Henneman">Brian Henneman</a>, <i>A.M.</i> reached #27 on the Billboard heatseeker chart; it would later place 34th on the <i><a href="/wiki/Village_Voice.html" title="Village Voice">Village Voice</a>'</i>s Pazz &amp; Jop Critics Poll for 1995. However, because <i><a href="/wiki/A.M._%28album%29.html" title="A.M. (album)">A.M.</a></i> was hastily recorded and released by Jeff Tweedy and most of the remaining members of Uncle Tupelo, it for the most part does not depart from the alt.country sound. This is why it is viewed by many as the least adventurous and original of the band's discography.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Multi-instrumentalist.html" title="Multi-instrumentalist">Multi-instrumentalist</a> <a href="/wiki/Jay_Bennett.html" title="Jay Bennett">Jay Bennett</a> later joined the band, expanding their already rich sound, adding more <a href="/wiki/Electronica.html" title="Electronica">electronic</a>/<a href="/wiki/Keyboard_instrument.html" title="Keyboard instrument">keyboard</a> music, as well as the strength of a second <a href="/wiki/Guitar.html" title="Guitar">guitar</a>.</p>
<p>"Initially, it was just as lead guitar player," recalls Bennett, "I don't think I even mentioned that I played piano at all...I was a little intimidated by these guys at first...They had already had a sound that people really liked. But they also wanted to make pop records - <i><a href="/wiki/A.M._%28album%29.html" title="A.M. (album)">A.M.</a></i> was supposed to be a pop record, but it didn't really come across...When we did the second album <i><a href="/wiki/Being_There_%28album%29.html" title="Being There (album)">Being There</a></i>, I began to suggest parts on keyboards that weren't part of the song as originally written [on guitars and drums]. And once that happened, the door was just kicked open to another way of making a record."</p>
<p>When Wilco released the <a href="/wiki/Double_album.html" title="Double album">double album</a> <i><a href="/wiki/Being_There_%28album%29.html" title="Being There (album)">Being There</a></i>, it won glowing reviews (it placed 14th on the Pazz &amp; Jop Critics Poll for 1996) and a devoted group of fans, but average sales, reaching #73 on the Billboard album charts. The track "Outtasite (Outta Mind)" reached the mainstream and modern rock top 40 in <a href="/wiki/1997.html" title="1997">1997</a>. Besides using country as a touchstone for their music Wilco made their classic rock influences on many tracks apparent including Stones-esque album closer "Dreamer in My Dreams". Wilco's experimental side also came out on two tracks; "Misunderstood" and "Sunken Treasure" which saw noise and more studio effects being added to their sound. It was during this time that Tweedy's lyrics began to become more abstract and introspective instead of being based on linear narratives like the songs "Box Full of Letters" and "Passenger Side" that appeared on <i><a href="/wiki/A.M._%28album%29.html" title="A.M. (album)">A.M.</a></i></p>
<p>Johnston left the band soon after <i><a href="/wiki/Being_There_%28album%29.html" title="Being There (album)">Being There</a></i> and joined the Austin band <a href="/wiki/The_Gourds.html" title="The Gourds">The Gourds</a> as a multi-instrumentalist. "When [Johnston later] left the band, the traditional Wilco role of 'other guy' became me," recalls Bennett.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Mermaid Avenue &amp; Summerteeth">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Mermaid_Avenue_.26_Summerteeth" id="Mermaid_Avenue_.26_Summerteeth"></a></p>
<h3><i>Mermaid Avenue</i> &amp; <i>Summerteeth</i></h3>
<p>During the spring of 1995, <a href="/wiki/Woody_Guthrie.html" title="Woody Guthrie">Woody Guthrie</a>'s daughter Nora had contacted English singer-songwriter <a href="/wiki/Billy_Bragg.html" title="Billy Bragg">Billy Bragg</a> about writing music for a selection of completed Guthrie lyrics. Her father had left behind over a thousand sets of complete lyrics written between 1939 and 1967; none of these lyrics had any music other than a vague stylistic notation. Bragg would later approach Wilco, asking them to participate in the project as well. Wilco agreed, and in addition to recording with Bragg in Ireland, they were given their own share of songs to finish.</p>
<p>Rather than recreating tunes in Guthrie's style, Bragg and Wilco created new, contemporary music for the lyrics. What seemed like a risky enterprise surprised everyone; released in 1998 as <i><a href="/wiki/Mermaid_Avenue.html" title="Mermaid Avenue">Mermaid Avenue</a></i>, the results were met with universal acclaim. The album got a Grammy nomination for Best Contemporary Folk Album, and went on to place fourth on the Pazz &amp; Jop Critics Poll for 1998 (right behind <a href="/wiki/Bob_Dylan.html" title="Bob Dylan">Bob Dylan</a>'s <a  class="new" title="Live 1966">Live 1966</a>).</p>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/1999.html" title="1999">1999</a>, the band released <i><a href="/wiki/Summerteeth.html" title="Summerteeth">Summerteeth</a></i>, showing a band evolving from country to electric rockers. Songs like "Can't Stand It" and "I'm Always in Love" demonstrated a buzzing shift in their sound. Reprise had higher expectations, but the album peaked at a disappointing #78 on the Billboard album charts. Regardless, it was still critically acclaimed and managed to place 8th on the Pazz &amp; Jop Critics Poll for 1999. <i>Summerteeth</i> also represented a new focus on creating "studio sounds" that were added to the live tracking for effect. With later albums, Tweedy and Co.'s fascination with these studio sounds would continue to grow.</p>
<p>They returned to their country roots once more with the warmly-received <i><a href="/wiki/Mermaid_Avenue_Vol._II.html" title="Mermaid Avenue Vol. II">Mermaid Avenue Vol. II</a></i>, a sequel of sorts to the original project. Many of the tracks were leftover from the first <i>Mermaid Avenue</i> sessions, but Wilco also finished a few more songs, including "Someday Some Morning Sometime," which foreshadowed their next release. (<i>Mermaid Avenue Vol. II</i> would go on to place 32nd on Pazz &amp; Jop's Critics Poll for 2000.)</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Yankee Hotel Foxtrot">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Yankee_Hotel_Foxtrot" id="Yankee_Hotel_Foxtrot"></a></p>
<h3><i>Yankee Hotel Foxtrot</i></h3>
<p>The band's next album, <i><a href="/wiki/Yankee_Hotel_Foxtrot.html" title="Yankee Hotel Foxtrot">Yankee Hotel Foxtrot</a></i>, is considered by many in the music industry to be one of <a href="/wiki/2002.html" title="2002">2002</a>'s best albums, as well as a standout in terms of innovation. What started as an album continuing down the musical and sonic path set by <i>Summerteeth</i> morphed into a monster that would attract plenty of adulation and trouble.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Glenn_Kotche.html" title="Glenn Kotche">Glenn Kotche</a> replaced Coomer on <a href="/wiki/Drum.html" title="Drum">drums</a> (Coomer would later play with the band <a href="/wiki/Swag.html" title="Swag">Swag</a>), and brought a more musical and improvisational style of playing to the songs. Multi-instrumentalist <a href="/wiki/Leroy_Bach.html" title="Leroy Bach">Leroy Bach</a> also joined so the band could better duplicate their complex arrangements live and in the studio.</p>
<p>The production seemed to go well, though serious rifts formed between Bennett and his bandmates. The situation came to a boil when experimental musician and producer <a href="/wiki/Jim_O%27Rourke_%28musician%29.html" title="Jim O'Rourke (musician)">Jim O'Rourke</a> was asked to remix the album over Bennett's objections. Contrary to popular belief, O'Rourke actually stripped away some of the avant-garde noises recorded by Wilco rather than bring them up in the mix.</p>
<div class="thumb tleft">
<div style="width:182px;"><a  class="internal" title="Wilco in 2003, after Bennett's dismissal"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/b7/Wilco2003.jpg/180px-Wilco2003.jpg" alt="Wilco in 2003, after Bennett's dismissal" width="180" height="148" longdesc="/wiki/Image:Wilco2003.jpg" /></a>

</div>
</div>
<p>Bennett was not pleased with O'Rourke's involvement, and he was fired from the band shortly after completion of the album. (Bennett later began a project with longtime collaborator <a href="/wiki/Edward_Burch.html" title="Edward Burch">Edward Burch</a> and released <i>The Palace at 4 A.M.</i> on the same day <i>Yankee Hotel Foxtrot</i> was ultimately released.)</p>
<p>The situation grew worse when <a href="/wiki/Reprise_Records.html" title="Reprise Records">Reprise Records</a>, the band's label and a <a href="/wiki/Time_Warner.html" title="Time Warner">Warner</a> subsidiary, rejected the album, sparking a long search to find a new home for the band. In the meantime, Wilco streamed the album from their <a href="/wiki/Website.html" title="Website">website</a> after purchasing the master tapes for $50,000. Ironically, the band ended up at <a href="/wiki/Nonesuch_Records.html" title="Nonesuch Records">Nonesuch Records</a>, another Time Warner subsidiary, and the album was released in the spring of 2002.</p>
<p>When it was released, <i><a href="/wiki/Yankee_Hotel_Foxtrot.html" title="Yankee Hotel Foxtrot">Yankee Hotel Foxtrot</a></i> reached #12 on the Billboard album charts, Wilco's highest chart position to that date, as well as charting in Australia. <i><a href="/wiki/Yankee_Hotel_Foxtrot.html" title="Yankee Hotel Foxtrot">Yankee Hotel Foxtrot</a></i> would later go on to sell over 500,000 copies, and to date remains Wilco's best selling album.</p>
<p>Some fans were alienated by the noise driven elements of many <i>YHF</i> tracks, but the band did attract new fans who appreciated their new direction. Despite Reprise's earlier doubts of commercial viability, songs like "Heavy Metal Drummer" and "Jesus, etc." became staples of alternative and progressive rock radio. More impressively, <i>Yankee Hotel Foxtrot</i> topped 2002's Pazz &amp; Jop Critics Poll, winning 2328 points over 201 votes. (Second place was taken by Beck's <i>Sea Change</i>, which won 1506 points over 139 votes.)</p>

The <a href="/wiki/DVD.html" title="DVD">DVD</a> release contains the movie, with a commentary by the director and the band, and a bonus disc containing extra footage and clips of live performances.</p>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a>, Wilco teamed up with <a href="/wiki/The_Minus_5.html" title="The Minus 5">The Minus 5</a> (primarily <a href="/wiki/Scott_McCaughey.html" title="Scott McCaughey">Scott McCaughey</a> and <a href="/wiki/REM_%28band%29.html" title="REM (band)">REM</a> guitarist <a href="/wiki/Peter_Buck.html" title="Peter Buck">Peter Buck</a>) to record <i><a href="/wiki/Down_With_Wilco.html" title="Down With Wilco">Down With Wilco</a></i>.

<h3><i>The Wilco Book</i></h3>
<p>Released with full cooperation of the band soon after <i><a href="/wiki/A_Ghost_is_Born.html" title="A Ghost is Born">A Ghost is Born</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/The_Wilco_Book.html" title="The Wilco Book">The Wilco Book</a></i> is a fan book of pictures of the band, their equipment, and interviews with the band, stage techs, and producer Jim O'Rourke on writing, recording, and performing music. There are also random pages of ephemera which fill out the pages in between the main sections (for instance, a rough thematic sketch of <i><a href="/wiki/A_Ghost_is_Born.html" title="A Ghost is Born">A Ghost is Born</a></i>). The book itself reads like a record album, including an interlude consisting of an essay and paintings by artist Henry Miller. The essay "5 Songs" by writer Rick Moody traces Wilco's career by choosing one song from each full album (this essay was generally considered a fluff piece and has hurt Rick Moody's reputation since). A CD of early <i><a href="/wiki/A_Ghost_is_Born.html" title="A Ghost is Born">A Ghost is Born</a></i> recordings is also included.</p>

<h3><i>Kicking Television: Live in Chicago</i></h3>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/November_15.html" title="November 15">November 15</a>, <a href="/wiki/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a> the band released a live album entitled <i><a  title="Kicking Television: Live in Chicago">Kicking Television: Live in Chicago</a></i>, recorded May 4-7, 2005 at the Vic Theater in Chicago, Illinois. Originally intended as a DVD/CD package, the band panned the idea after seeing some footage and determining it looked boring. It is the first Wilco album to feature the two newest members of the band. The album was ranked at #16 in <a href="/wiki/Q_magazine.html" title="Q magazine">Q magazine</a>'s "20 Best Live Albums" list.</p>

<h3>Recent activity</h3>
<p>On May 8, 2006, Glenn Kotche said that the band was in the writing and demoing stages of creating a new record, and that four or five of those songs had made it in to the band's recent live sets. The new songs include "On and On and On," "Is that the thanks I get/ We can make it better," "Walken," "Impossible Germany," "What Light," "Let's Fight," and "Either Way." Kotche also said that some of the new songs were written on the spot in the studio by the band as a whole, as opposed to Tweedy fleshing out the song and bringing it to the rest of the band. <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://pitchforkmedia.com/news/06-05/08.shtml">[1]</a></p>
<p>In a June 2006 interview, guitarist Cline revealed that the band would be writing and demoing new songs in August, followed by recording sessions in November, with the new album tentatively scheduled for a Spring 2007 release. <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.straight.com/content.cfm?id=18611">[2]</a></p>
<p>In late August 2006 a solo Jeff Tweedy dvd was announced to be released on October 24, 2006. It's entitled <a  title="Sunken Treasure: Live in the Pacific Northwest">Sunken Treasure: Live in the Pacific Northwest</a> and includes Wilco, <a href="/wiki/Loose_Fur.html" title="Loose Fur">Loose Fur</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Uncle_Tupelo.html" title="Uncle Tupelo">Uncle Tupelo</a> songs.</p>
