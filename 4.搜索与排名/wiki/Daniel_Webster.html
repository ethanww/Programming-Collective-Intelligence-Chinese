<p><b>Daniel Webster</b> (<a href="/wiki/January_18.html" title="January 18">January 18</a>, <a href="/wiki/1782.html" title="1782">1782</a> – <a href="/wiki/October_25.html" title="October 25">October 25</a>, <a href="/wiki/1852.html" title="1852">1852</a>) was a leading <a href="/wiki/United_States.html" title="United States">American</a> statesman during the nation's <a href="/wiki/Antebellum.html" title="Antebellum">antebellum</a> era. Webster first rose to regional prominence through his defense of New England shipping interests. His increasingly nationalistic positions and the effectiveness with which he articulated them led Webster to become one of the most famous orators and influential <a href="/wiki/Whig_Party_%28United_States%29.html" title="Whig Party (United States)">Whig</a> leaders of the <a href="/wiki/Second_Party_System.html" title="Second Party System">Second Party System</a>.</p>
<p>As an attorney he served as legal counsel in several cases that established important constitutional precedents that bolstered the authority of the Federal government. As <a href="/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_State.html" title="United States Secretary of State">Secretary of State</a>, Webster negotiated the <a href="/wiki/Webster-Ashburton_Treaty.html" title="Webster-Ashburton Treaty">Webster-Ashburton Treaty</a> that established the definitive Eastern border between the United States and <a href="/wiki/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canada</a>. Primarily recognized for his <a href="/wiki/United_States_Senate.html" title="United States Senate">Senate</a> tenure, Webster was a key figure in the institution's "Golden Age". So well known was his skill as a Senator throughout this period that Webster became a third of what was and still is known today as the "<a href="/wiki/Great_Triumvirate.html" title="Great Triumvirate">Great Triumvirate</a>", along with his colleagues <a href="/wiki/Henry_Clay.html" title="Henry Clay">Henry Clay</a> and <a href="/wiki/John_C._Calhoun.html" title="John C. Calhoun">John C. Calhoun</a>.</p>
<p>Like Henry Clay, his desire to see the Union preserved and conflict averted led him to search out compromises designed to stave off the sectionalism that threatened war between the <a href="/wiki/Union_%28American_Civil_War%29.html" title="Union (American Civil War)">North</a> and <a href="/wiki/Confederate_States_of_America.html" title="Confederate States of America">South</a>. Though Webster made three bids he never achieved the <a href="/wiki/President_of_the_United_States.html" title="President of the United States">Presidency</a>, his final attempt failing in part because of his compromises. Like his attempts at gaining the <a href="/wiki/White_House.html" title="White House">White House</a>, Webster's efforts at steering the nation away from civil war toward a definite peace would ultimately prove futile. Despite this, Webster came to be esteemed for his attempts, being officially named by the Senate in 1957 as one of its five most outstanding members.</p>

<h2>Early life</h2>
<p>Daniel Webster was born <a href="/wiki/January_18.html" title="January 18">January 18</a>, <a href="/wiki/1782.html" title="1782">1782</a> to Ebenezer and Abigail Webster (née Eastman) in <a href="/wiki/Salisbury%2C_New_Hampshire.html" title="Salisbury, New Hampshire">Salisbury, New Hampshire</a>. There he and his other nine siblings were raised on his parents' farm, a small parcel of land granted to his father in recognition of his service in the <a href="/wiki/French_and_Indian_War.html" title="French and Indian War">French and Indian War</a>. As Daniel was a “sickly” child, his family indulged him, exempting him from the harsh rigors of 18th century <a href="/wiki/New_England.html" title="New England">New England</a> farm life.<sup id="_ref-American_Eras_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Though uneducated, Ebenezer Webster was made a judge on the local court in 1791, a position which carried a salary of four hundred dollars; the Elder Webster resolved to use this money to educate young Daniel.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a  title="">[2]</a></sup> After attending local schools for most of his life, Daniel Webster was subsequently enrolled at the <a href="/wiki/Phillips_Exeter_Academy.html" title="Phillips Exeter Academy">Phillips Exeter Academy</a> at age 14. There the other boys laughed at his rustic clothing and mannerisms.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a  title="">[3]</a></sup> After nine months at Phillips, the Websters were unable to meet the academy's costs and were forced to recall Daniel home.<sup id="_ref-Discovering_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[4]</a></sup> He studied under a private tutor until the summer of 1797, when he enrolled at <a href="/wiki/Dartmouth_College.html" title="Dartmouth College">Dartmouth College</a>.</p>
<p>Dartmouth had a mandatory <a href="/wiki/Declamation.html" title="Declamation">declamation</a> class, and he also practiced the art of oratory at the <a  class="new" title="United Fraternity Literary Society">United Fraternity Literary Society</a>. This ended the terror of public speaking which had been produced by the ridicule of his schoolmates, and developed his mature classicizing style. According to <a href="/wiki/John_F._Kennedy.html" title="John F. Kennedy">John F. Kennedy</a>, Webster could "think out a speech, sentence by sentence, correct the sentences in his mind without the use of a pencil, and then deliver it exactly as he thought it out."<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a  title="">[5]</a></sup> Webster soon became known throughout <a href="/wiki/Hanover%2C_New_Hampshire.html" title="Hanover, New Hampshire">Hanover</a> as an orator and in 1800 Webster was invited to give an oration at their Independence Day celebration. Dartmouth graduated Webster as a member of <a href="/wiki/Phi_Beta_Kappa.html" title="Phi Beta Kappa">Phi Beta Kappa</a> in 1801.</p>

<p>After graduation, Webster was apprenticed to the lawyer <a href="/wiki/Thomas_W._Thompson.html" title="Thomas W. Thompson">Thomas W. Thompson</a>. Webster was forced to resign and become a schoolmaster (as young men often did then, when <a href="/wiki/Public_education_in_the_United_States.html" title="Public education in the United States">public education</a> consisted largely of subsidies to local schoolmasters), when his older brother's own quest for education put a financial strain on the family that consequently required Webster's support. When his brother's education could no longer be sustained, Webster returned to his apprenticeship. Webster left New Hampshire and got employment in Boston under the prominent attorney <a href="/wiki/Christopher_Gore.html" title="Christopher Gore">Christopher Gore</a> in 1804. Clerking for Gore—who was involved in international, national, and state politics—Webster educated himself on various political subjects and met New England politicians.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a  title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 1805 Webster was accepted into the bar and returned to New Hampshire to set up a practice in <a href="/wiki/Boscawen%2C_New_Hampshire.html" title="Boscawen, New Hampshire">Boscawen</a>, in part to be near his ailing father. During this time, Webster took a more active interest in politics. Raised by an ardently Federalist father and taught by a predominantly Federalist leaning faculty at Dartmouth, Webster, like many New Englanders, supported Federalism. Accordingly, he accepted a number of minor local speaking engagements in support of Federalist causes and candidates.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a  title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>After his father's death in 1806, Webster handed over his practice to his older brother Ezekiel, who had by this time finished his schooling and been admitted to the bar. Webster then moved to the larger town of <a href="/wiki/Portsmouth%2C_New_Hampshire.html" title="Portsmouth, New Hampshire">Portsmouth</a> in 1807, and opened a practice there.<sup id="_ref-Discovering_1" class="reference"><a  title="">[4]</a></sup> During this time the <a href="/wiki/Napoleonic_wars.html" title="Napoleonic wars">Napoleonic wars</a> began to affect Americans as <a href="/wiki/Britain.html" title="Britain">Britain</a>, short of sailors, strengthened its navy through the <a href="/wiki/Impressment.html" title="Impressment">impressment</a> of American sailors thought to be British deserters. President <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson.html" title="Thomas Jefferson">Jefferson</a> retaliated with the <a href="/wiki/Embargo_Act_of_1807.html" title="Embargo Act of 1807">Embargo Act of 1807</a>, ceasing all trade to both Britain and France. As New England was heavily reliant upon commerce with the two nations, the region vehemently opposed Jefferson's attempt at "peaceable coercion," including Webster, who wrote an anonymous pamphlet attacking it.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a  title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>Eventually the trouble with England escalted into the <a href="/wiki/War_of_1812.html" title="War of 1812">War of 1812</a>. That same year, Daniel Webster gave an address to the Washington Benevolent Society, an oration that proved critical to his career. The speech decried the war and the violation of New England's shipping rights that preceded it, but it also strongly denounced the extremism of those more radical among the unhappy New Englanders who were beginning to call for the region's secession from the Union.</p>
<p>The Washington oration was widely circulated and read throughout New Hampshire, and it led to Webster's 1812 selection to the <a  class="new" title="Rockingham Convention">Rockingham Convention</a>, an assembly that sought to formally declare the state's grievances with President Madison and the <a href="/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States.html" title="Federal government of the United States">federal government</a>. There, he was a member of the drafting committee and was chosen to compose the <i>Rockingham Memorial</i> to be sent to Madison. The report included much of the same tone and opinions held in the Washington Society address, except that it, uncharacteristically of its chief architect, alluded to the threat of secession saying, "If a separation of the states shall ever take place, it will be, on some occasion, when one portion of the country undertakes to control, to regulate, and to sacrifice the interest of another."<sup id="_ref-Discovering_2" class="reference"><a  title="">[4]</a></sup></p>

<p>Webster's efforts on behalf of New England Federalism, shipping interests, and war opposition resulted in his election to the <a href="/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives.html" title="United States House of Representatives">House of Representatives</a> in 1812, where he served two terms ending March 1817. He was an outspoken critic of the Madison Administration and its wartime policies, denouncing its efforts at financing the war through paper money and opposing Secretary of War <a href="/wiki/James_Monroe.html" title="James Monroe">James Monroe</a>'s <a href="/wiki/Conscription_in_the_United_States.html" title="Conscription in the United States">conscription</a> proposal.

<p>This opposition was in accordance with a number of his professed beliefs (and the majority of his constituents') including <a href="/wiki/Free_trade.html" title="Free trade">free trade</a>, that the tariff's "great object was to raise revenue, not to foster manufacture," and that it was against "the true spirit of the Constitution" to give "excessive bounties or encouragements to one [industry] over another." <sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a  title="">[9]</a></sup> <sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a  title="">[10]</a></sup></p>

Webster pleads Dartmouth's case before the court</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Webster had been highly regarded in New Hampshire since his days in Boscawen, and had been respected throughout the House during his service there. He came to national prominence, however, as counsel in a number of important <a href="/wiki/United_States_Supreme_Court.html" title="United States Supreme Court">Supreme Court</a> cases.<sup id="_ref-American_Eras_1" class="reference"><a  title="">[1]</a></sup> These cases remain major precedents in the Constitutional jurisprudence of the United States.</p>
<p>In 1816, Webster was retained by the Federalist trustees of his alma mater, Dartmouth College, to represent them in their case against the newly elected New Hampshire Republican <a href="/wiki/State_legislature.html" title="State legislature">state legislature</a>. The legislature had passed new laws converting Dartmouth into a state institution, by changing the size of the college's trustee body and adding a further board of overseers, which they put into the hands of the state senate.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a  title="">[12]</a></sup> New Hampshire argued that they, as successor in sovereignty to George III, who had chartered Dartmouth, they had the right to revise the charter.</p>

Sir, you may destroy this little institution; it is weak; it is in your hands! I know it is one of the lesser lights in the literary horizon of our country. You may put it out. But if you do so you must carry through your work! You must extinguish, one after another, all those greater lights of science which for more than a century have thrown their radiance over our land. <i>It is, sir, as I have said, a small college.

<p>Webster argued <i><a href="/wiki/Dartmouth_College_v._Woodward.html" title="Dartmouth College v. Woodward">Dartmouth College v. Woodward</a></i> to the Supreme Court (with significant aid from <a href="/wiki/Jeremiah_Mason.html" title="Jeremiah Mason">Jeremiah Mason</a> and <a href="/wiki/Jeremiah_Smith.html" title="Jeremiah Smith">Jeremiah Smith</a>), invoking <a  title="Article One of the United States Constitution">Article I, section 10</a> of the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Constitution.html" title="United States Constitution">Constitution</a> (the <a href="/wiki/Contract_Clause.html" title="Contract Clause">Contract Clause</a>) against the State. The Marshall court, continuing with its history of limiting states rights and reaffirming the supremacy of the Constitutional protection of contract, ruled in favor of Webster and Dartmouth 3–1. This decided that corporations did not, as many then held, have to justify their privileges by acting in the public interest, but were independent of the states.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a  title="">[13]</a></sup></p>
<p>Other notable appearances by Webster before the Supreme Court include his representation of James McCulloch in <i><a href="/wiki/McCulloch_v._Maryland.html" title="McCulloch v. Maryland">McCulloch v. Maryland</a></i> (1819), the Cohens in <i><a href="/wiki/Cohens_v._Virginia.html" title="Cohens v. Virginia">Cohens v.

<p>Daniel Webster's growing prominence as a constitutional lawyer led to his election as a delegate to the 1820 Massachusetts <a href="/wiki/Constitutional_Convention.html" title="Constitutional Convention">Constitutional Convention</a>. There he spoke in opposition to <a href="/wiki/Universal_suffrage.html" title="Universal suffrage">universal suffrage</a> (for men), on the Federalist grounds that power naturally follows property, and the vote should be limited accordingly; but the constitution was amended against his advice.<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a  title="">[15]</a></sup> He also supported the (existing) districting of the State Senate so that each seat represented an equal amount of property.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a  title="">[16]</a></sup></p>
<p>Webster’s performance at the convention furthered his reputation. <a href="/wiki/Joseph_Story.html" title="Joseph Story">Joseph Story</a> (also a delegate at the convention) wrote to Jeremiah Mason following the convention saying "Our friend Webster has gained a noble reputation.

He was elected to the <a href="/wiki/18th_United_States_Congress.html" title="18th United States Congress">Eighteenth Congress</a> in 1822, from Boston.</p>
<p>In his second term, Webster found himself a leader of the fragmented House Federalists who had split following the failure of the secessionist minded 1814 <a href="/wiki/Hartford_Convention.html" title="Hartford Convention">Hartford Convention</a> that he avoided. <a href="/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives.html" title="Speaker of the United States House of Representatives">Speaker</a> <a href="/wiki/Henry_Clay.html" title="Henry Clay">Henry Clay</a> made Webster chairman of the <a href="/wiki/United_States_House_Committee_on_the_Judiciary.html" title="United States House Committee on the Judiciary">Judicary Committee</a> in an attempt to win his and the Federalists' support. His term of service in the House between 1822 and 1828 was marked by his legislative success at reforming the United States criminal code, and his failure at expanding the size of the Supreme court. He largely supported the <a href="/wiki/National_Republican.html" title="National Republican">National Republican</a> <a href="/wiki/John_Quincy_Adams.html" title="John Quincy Adams">Adams administration</a>, including Adams' candidacy in the highly contested election of 1824 and the administration's defense of treaty sanctioned <a href="/wiki/Creek_Indian.html" title="Creek Indian">Creek Indian</a> land rights against Georgia's expansionist claims.<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a  title="">[18]</a></sup></p>

With the support of a coalition of both Federalists and Republicans, Webster's record in the House and his celebrity as an orator led to his June 1827 election to the Senate from Massachusetts. His first wife, Grace, died in January 1828, and he married Caroline LeRoy in December 1829.</p>

<i>Webster Replying to Hayne</i> by George P.A. Healy</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>When Webster returned to the Senate from his wife's funeral, in March 1828, he found the body considering a <a href="/wiki/Tariff_of_Abominations.html" title="Tariff of Abominations">new tariff bill</a>, that sought to increase the duties on foreign manufactured goods on top of the increases of 1824 and 1816, both of which Webster had opposed. Now however, Webster changed his position to support a protective tariff. Explaining the change, Webster stated that after the failure of the rest of the nation to heed New England's objections in 1816 and 1824, "nothing was left to New England but to conform herself to the will of others," and now consequently being heavily invested in manufacturing, he would not now do them injury. It is the more blunt opinion of Justus D. Doenecke that Webster's support of the 1828 tariff was a result of "his new closeness to the rising mill-owning families of the region, the <a href="/wiki/Abbott_Lawrence.html" title="Abbott Lawrence">Lawrences</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Lowell_family.html" title="Lowell family">Lowells</a>."<sup id="_ref-Discovering_3" class="reference"><a  title="">[4]</a></sup> Webster also gave greater approval to Clay's American System, a change that along with his modified view of the tariff brought him closer to Henry Clay.</p>
<p>The passage of the tariff brought increased sectional tensions to the U.S., tensions that were agitated by then Vice President John C. Calhoun's promulgation of his <a href="/wiki/South_Carolina_Exposition_and_Protest.html" title="South Carolina Exposition and Protest">South Carolina Exposition and Protest</a>. The exposition espoused the idea of <a href="/wiki/Nullification.html" title="Nullification">nullification</a>, a doctrine first articulated in the U.S. by <a href="/wiki/James_Madison.html" title="James Madison">Madison</a> and <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson.html" title="Thomas Jefferson">Jefferson</a> that held that states were sovereign entities and held ultimate authority over the limits of the power of the federal government and could thus "nullify" any act of the central government it deemed unconstitutional. While for a time the tensions increased by Calhoun's exposition lay beneath the surface, they burst forth when South Carolina Senator <a href="/wiki/Robert_Young_Hayne.html" title="Robert Young Hayne">Robert Young Hayne</a> opened the 1830 <a href="/wiki/Webster-Hayne_debate.html" title="Webster-Hayne debate">Webster-Hayne debate</a>.</p>
<p>By 1830, Federal land policy had long been an issue. The National Republican administration had held land prices high. According to Adams' Secretary of the Treasury <a href="/wiki/Richard_Rush.html" title="Richard Rush">Richard Rush</a>, this served to provide the federal government with an additional source of revenue, but also to discourage westward migration that tended to increase wages through the increased scarcity of labor. <sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a  title="">[19]</a></sup> Senator Hayne, in an effort to sway the west against the north and the tariff, seized upon a minor point in the land debate and accused the north of attempting to limit western expansion for their own benefit. As <a href="/wiki/Vice_President.html" title="Vice President">Vice President</a> Calhoun was <a href="/wiki/President_of_the_Senate.html" title="President of the Senate">presiding officer</a> over the Senate but could not address the Senate in business; James Schouler contended that Hayne was doing what Calhoun could not.<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a  title="">[20]</a></sup></p>
<p>The next day, Webster, feeling compelled to respond on New England's behalf, gave his first rebuttal to Hayne, highlighting what he saw as the virtues of the North's policies toward the west and claiming that restrictions on western expansion and growth were primarily the responsibility of southerners. Hayne in turn responded the following day, denouncing Webster's inconsistencies with regards to the American system and personally attacking Webster for his role in the so called "<a href="/wiki/Corrupt_bargain.html" title="Corrupt bargain">corrupt bargain</a>" of 1824. The course of the debate strayed even further away from the initial matter of land sales with Hayne openly defending the "Carolina Doctrine" of nullification as being the doctrine of Jefferson and Madison.</p>

<p>On <a href="/wiki/January_26.html" title="January 26">January 26</a>, Webster gave his <i>Second Reply to Hayne</i>, in which Webster openly attacked Nullification, negatively contrasted South Carolina's response to the tariff with that of his native New England's response to the Embargo of 1807, rebutted Hayne's personal attacks against him, and famously concluded in defiance of nullification (which was later embodied in John C. Calhoun's declaration of <i>"The Union; second to our liberty most dear!"</i>), <i>"Liberty and Union, now and for ever, one and inseparable!"</i></p>
<p>While the debate's philosophical presentation of nullification and Webster's abstract fears of rebellion would be brought into reality in 1832 when Calhoun's native South Carolina passed its <a href="/wiki/Ordinance_of_Nullification.html" title="Ordinance of Nullification">Ordinance of Nullification</a>, Webster supported Andrew Jackson's sending of U.S. troops to the borders of South Carolina and the <a href="/wiki/Force_Bill.html" title="Force Bill">Force Bill</a>, not Henry Clay's 1833 compromise that would eventually defuse the crisis. Webster thought Clay's concessions to be dangerous and would only further embolden the south and legitimize its tactics. Especially unsettling was the resolution affirming that "the people of the several States composing these United States are united as parties to a constitutional compact, to which the people of each State <i>acceded</i> as a separate sovereign community." The usage of the word accede would, in his opinion, lead to the logical end of those states' right to <a href="/wiki/Secede.html" title="Secede">secede</a>.</p>

<p>At the same time however, Webster, like Clay, opposed the econmic policies of Andrew Jackson, the most famous of those being Jackson's campaign against the <a href="/wiki/Second_Bank_of_the_United_States.html" title="Second Bank of the United States">Second Bank of the United States</a> in 1832, an institution that held Webster on retainer as legal counsel and whose Boston Branch he was the director of.

There was an economic <a href="/wiki/Panic_of_1837.html" title="Panic of 1837">panic in 1837</a>, which converted Webster's heavy speculation in mid-western property into a personal debt from which Webster would never recover.

<p>In 1836, Webster was one of three Whig party candidates to run for the office of <a href="/wiki/President_of_the_United_States.html" title="President of the United States">President</a>, but he only managed to gain the support of Massachusetts.

<p>Resigning the Senate under a cloud in 1850, he resumed his former position as Secretary of State in the cabinet of Whig President <a href="/wiki/Millard_Fillmore.html" title="Millard Fillmore">Millard Fillmore</a>.

<p>Ralph Waldo Emerson, who had criticized Webster following the Seventh of March address, remarked in the immediate aftermath of his death that Webster was "the completest man", and that "nature had not in our days or not since Napoleon, cut out such a masterpiece." Others like Henry Cabot Lodge and John F. Kennedy note Webster's vices, especially the perpetual debt against which he, as Lodge reports, employed "checks or notes for several thousand dollars in token of admiration" from his friends. "This was, of course, utterly wrong and demoralizing, but Mr. Webster came, after a time, to look upon such transactions as natural and proper. [...] He seems to have regarded the merchants and bankers of State Street very much as a feudal baron regarded his peasantry. It was their privilege and duty to support him, and he repaid them with an occasional magnificent compliment."<sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a  title="">[24]</a></sup></p>
<p>Several historians suggest Webster failed to exercise leadership for any political issue or vision. Lodge describes (with the Rockingham Convention in mind) Webster's "susceptibility to outside influences which formed such an odd trait in the character of a man so imperious by nature. When acting alone, he spoke his own opinions. When in a situation where public opinion was concentrated against him, he submitted to modifications of his views with a curious and indolent indifference."<sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a  title="">[25]</a></sup> Similarly, Schlesinger cites Webster's letter requesting retainers for fighting for the Bank, one of his most inveterate causes; he then asks how the American people could "follow [Webster] through hell or high water when he would not lead unless someone made up a purse for him?"</p>
<p>He served the interest of the wealthy Boston merchants who elected and supported him, first for free trade, and later, when they had started manufacturing, for protection; both for the Union and for a compromise with the South in 1850. Schlesinger remarks that the real miracle of <i><a href="/wiki/The_Devil_and_Daniel_Webster.html" title="The Devil and Daniel Webster">The Devil and Daniel Webster</a></i> is not a soul sold to the devil, or the jury of ghostly traitors, but Webster speaking against the sanctity of contract.</p>
<p>Webster has garnered respect and admiration for his Seventh of March speech in defense of the 1850 compromise measures that helped to delay the <a href="/wiki/American_Civil_War.html" title="American Civil War">Civil War</a>. In <a href="/wiki/Profiles_in_Courage.html" title="Profiles in Courage">Profiles in Courage</a>, Kennedy called Webster's defense of the compromise, despite the risk to his presidential ambitions and the denuciations he faced from the north, one of the "greatest acts of courageous principle" in the history of the Senate. Conversely, <i>Seventh of March</i> has been criticized by Lodge who contrasted the speech's support of the 1850 compromise with his 1833 rejection of similar measures. "While he was brave and true and wise in 1833," said Lodge, "in 1850 he was not only inconsistent, but that he erred deeply in policy and statesmanship" in his advocacy of a policy that "made war inevitable by encouraging slave-holders to believe that they could always obtain anything they wanted by a sufficient show of violence." <sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a  title="">[26]</a></sup></p>
<p>More widely agreed upon, notably by both Senator Lodge and President Kennedy, is Webster's skill as an orator with Kennedy praising Webster's "ability to make alive and supreme the latent sense of oneness, of union, that all Americans felt but few could express." <sup id="_ref-orator_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[27]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-24" class="reference"><a  title="">[28]</a></sup> Schlesinger however notes that he is also an example of the limitations of formal oratory: Congress heard Webster or Clay with admiration, but they rarely prevailed at the vote. Plainer speech and party solidarity were more effective; and Webster never approached Jackson's popular appeal.<sup id="_ref-25" class="reference"><a  title="">[29]</a></sup></p>
<p>Webster has been commemorated in numerous forms: the popular short story, play (and movie) "<a href="/wiki/The_Devil_and_Daniel_Webster.html" title="The Devil and Daniel Webster">The Devil and Daniel Webster</a>" by <a href="/wiki/Stephen_Vincent_Ben%C3%A9t.html" title="Stephen Vincent Benét">Stephen Vincent Benét</a>; a statue representing New Hampshire in Statuary Hall in the <a href="/wiki/U.S._Capitol_building.html" title="U.S. Capitol building">U.S. Capitol building</a>; a battle ship, the <a href="/wiki/USS_Daniel_Webster.html" title="USS Daniel Webster">USS <i>Daniel Webster</i></a>; and a college, <a href="/wiki/Daniel_Webster_College.html" title="Daniel Webster College">Daniel Webster College</a>, located in <a href="/wiki/Nashua%2C_New_Hampshire.html" title="Nashua, New Hampshire">Nashua, New Hampshire</a>.
