<h2>Features</h2>
<p>Announced <a href="/wiki/November_1.html" title="November 1">November 1</a>, <a href="/wiki/1983.html" title="1983">1983</a>, and first shipped in March <a href="/wiki/1984.html" title="1984">1984</a>, the PCjr came in two models: the <b>4860-004</b>, with 64K of memory, priced at US$669; and the <b>4860-067</b>, with 128K of memory and a 360K 5.25-inch floppy disk drive, priced at US$1269. The PCjr promised a high degree of compatibility with the <a href="/wiki/IBM_PC.html" title="IBM PC">IBM PC</a>, already a popular business computer, and offered built-in color graphics and sound that was better than the standard <a href="/wiki/PC_speaker.html" title="PC speaker">PC speaker</a> sound and <a href="/wiki/Color_Graphics_Adapter.html" title="Color Graphics Adapter">color graphics</a> of the standard IBM PC and compatible machines of the day. Additionally, its 4.77 MHz <a href="/wiki/Intel_8088.html" title="Intel 8088">Intel 8088</a> <a href="/wiki/CPU.html" title="CPU">CPU</a> was faster than other computers aimed at the home market, and its detached wireless infrared keyboard promised a degree of convenience none of its competitors had. Two cartridge slots promised easy loading of games and other software.</p>

<h3>Differences from the IBM PC</h3>
<p>Two joystick ports were built into the PCjr, evidence of IBM's goal for marketing the PCjr as a home-friendly machine. Along the same lines, the PCjr also introduced two <a href="/wiki/ROM.html" title="ROM">ROM</a> cartridge slots on the front of the unit, meant to load software quickly and easily. The cartridge(s) would be plugged in from the front, prompting the computer to automatically reboot and run the software. Loading and saving data from cartridge software was possible via the floppy drive.</p>
<p>Expansions (such as additional parallel ports, serial ports, memory, etc.) to the PCjr were provided via add-on "sidecars" that attached to the side of the PCjr. Multiple expansions stacked onto previously-installed expansions, increasing the width of the machine.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Differences from other personal computers">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Differences_from_other_personal_computers" id="Differences_from_other_personal_computers"></a></p>
<h3>Differences from other personal computers</h3>
<p>The PCjr shipped with a keyboard powered by AA batteries to provide infrared line-of-sight wireless communication. The keyboard could also operate with an <a href="/wiki/RJ11.html" title="RJ11">RJ11</a> telephone-style cable if so desired, eliminating battery usage. The PCjr was also designed with a lightpen port, which worked as a mouse replacement.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Failure in the marketplace">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Failure_in_the_marketplace" id="Failure_in_the_marketplace"></a></p>
<h2>Failure in the marketplace</h2>
<p>The PCjr launched with an enormous amount of advance publicity, including live news-broadcast coverage of the product announcement. <a href="/wiki/Ziff-Davis.html" title="Ziff-Davis">Ziff-Davis</a>, publisher of the successful <i><a href="/wiki/PC_Magazine.html" title="PC Magazine">PC Magazine</a></i>, printed the first issue of <i>PCjr Magazine</i> even before the first PCjr units shipped. Observers expected the PCjr to change the home-computer market in a similar way to how the IBM PC had singlehandedly changed the business market in the two years since its debut.</p>
<p>However, the PCjr was never well received. A prime target of criticism was its keyboard; IBM chose to use a <a href="/wiki/Chiclet_keyboard.html" title="Chiclet keyboard">chiclet keyboard</a>, similar to that of a pocket calculator, with wide spaces between keys to leave room for instructional overlays bundled with software packages. However, it was widely criticized as feeling cheap and being difficult to type on. IBM eventually replaced it for free with a conventional keyboard. Regardless of the keys' design, with only 62 keys, it lacked the numeric keypad and separate function keys of the IBM PC, and the layout was more awkward than that of most of its competitors.</p>
<p>At $669, the PCjr's price was not competitive. It cost more than twice as much as the <a href="/wiki/Commodore_64.html" title="Commodore 64">Commodore 64</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Atari_8-bit_family.html" title="Atari 8-bit family">Atari 8-bit family</a>; its price was close to that of the <a href="/wiki/Coleco_Adam.html" title="Coleco Adam">Coleco Adam</a>, but the Adam also included two tape drives, a printer, and software. With the exception of the <a href="/wiki/Apple_II.html" title="Apple II">Apple II</a>, it was possible to purchase a complete system (computer, disk drive, printer, and monitor) from almost any of IBM's competitors for less than the PCjr's entry price.</p>
<p>Many people compared the PCjr unfavorably to the IBM PC rather than to the machines against which it was directly competing. While compatibility with the IBM PC's large software library was a key selling point, in practice the PCjr proved incompatible with many popular PC applications, in part due to memory limitations and in part due to architectural differences.</p>
<p>The PCjr was often purchased by business people as a lower cost alternative to the PC, but then was quickly abandoned for business use. The BIOS was produced by the same company that wrote the BIOS for the PC, IBM, with published differences. At the time, it was popular for many programmers to use direct hardware BIOS "pokes" and "peeks" and process with assembly language as this offered performance advantages and compilers for PC's were limited. You had to keep the PCjr in mind when developing code, which most didn't. So, while most PC software would work, business packages competing for features and performance would often have odd hardware related crashes.</p>
<p>The keyboard issue alone was enough to sink the PCjr, but not having the same expansion slot type was really the death of the PCjr. When an expansion came out to add a hard drive, it would only work on the PC. The PC with a built-in hard drive came out next, known as the XT. No further development was done with the PCjr. The PCjr was not a PC clone as the first Compaq would be. It was a separate, but technically linked by the same vendor, computer, that, like an unusual mutation of early species, would just die out.</p>
<p>Arguably, the PCjr's technical capabilities may have justified its higher price tag: it was a 16-bit machine competing in an 8-bit world, offered better memory expansion, had a built-in 80 column display, and was faster than any of its competition. However, reviewers of home computers at the time cared much less about raw power and more about price, available software, and the quality of the keyboard. Moreover, while the PCjr may have been superior to its competitors in running <a href="/wiki/Office_suite.html" title="Office suite">office suite</a> software, it was clearly inferior to the <a href="/wiki/Commodore_64.html" title="Commodore 64">Commodore 64</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Atari_8-bit_family.html" title="Atari 8-bit family">Atari 8-bit family</a> as a gaming platform; unlike them, it had very limited color capabilities (due to its <a href="/wiki/Color_Graphics_Adapter.html" title="Color Graphics Adapter">CGA</a>-derived graphics chip) and no support for hardware <a href="/wiki/Sprite_%28computer_graphics%29.html" title="Sprite (computer graphics)">sprites</a>. Also, the sound chip was nowhere near as advanced as the <a href="/wiki/MOS_Technology_SID.html" title="MOS Technology SID">MOS Technology SID</a> found in the C64 (although it rivaled Atari's <a href="/wiki/Atari_POKEY.html" title="Atari POKEY">POKEY</a>). Since gaming capabilities were important to many <a href="/wiki/Home_computer.html" title="Home computer">home computer</a> buyers of the time (who often purchased the machines as replacements for older <a href="/wiki/Video_game_console.html" title="Video game console">game consoles</a>), this was another strike against the PCjr.</p>
<p>The PCjr was more difficult to expand than many of its intended competitors. It was not designed to add a second floppy drive, a <a href="/wiki/Hard_drive.html" title="Hard drive">hard drive</a>, or easily expand memory beyond 256K, which made it difficult to deliver on the promise of running business software for the IBM PC. Third parties created PCjr add-ons, including a second floppy drive or a 20-megabyte hard drive, but were not available right away. One particular company, PC Enterprises, produced several useful expansion kits, including a CPU speedup board, SCSI controller for hard drives, VGA video card, 3.5" floppy drive, and also many software products that shipped on floppy and on plug-in cartridge that enhanced the PCjr's compatibility with the IBM PC. PC Enterprises no longer provides PCjr products so these items are increasingly harder to find today.</p>
<p>Many IBM and third-party add-ons attached to an expansion slot on the computer's right side (dubbed "Sidecars"), similar to the design of the discontinued <a href="/wiki/TI_99/4A.html" title="TI 99/4A">TI 99/4A</a>; thus, as with the TI, multiple add-ons proved very clumsy. In addition, it was necessary to purchase additional power supplies for every few expansion modules attached to the computer; it was not unheard of for the computer to require three separate power bricks just to run with its expansions.</p>
<p>Unable to compete with the C64 and <a href="/wiki/Apple_Computer.html" title="Apple Computer">Apple Computer</a>'s <a href="/wiki/Apple_IIe.html" title="Apple IIe">IIe</a> and <a href="/wiki/Apple_IIc.html" title="Apple IIc">IIc</a>, let alone the forthcoming <a href="/wiki/Atari_ST.html" title="Atari ST">Atari ST</a> and <a href="/wiki/Commodore_Amiga.html" title="Commodore Amiga">Commodore Amiga</a>, IBM withdrew the PCjr from the marketplace in mid-<a href="/wiki/1985.html" title="1985">1985</a>.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: The PCjr legacy">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="The_PCjr_legacy" id="The_PCjr_legacy"></a></p>
<h2>The PCjr legacy</h2>
<p><a href="/wiki/Tandy_Corporation.html" title="Tandy Corporation">Tandy</a> produced a clone of the PCjr, the <a href="/wiki/Tandy_1000.html" title="Tandy 1000">Tandy 1000</a>. Since the PCjr was discontinued two weeks before the new computer was to be released, Tandy had to hastily change its marketing strategy. However, the machine and its many successors ultimately proved much more enduring than the PCjr itself, partly because the Tandy 1000 was sold in ubiquitous <a href="/wiki/Radio_Shack.html" title="Radio Shack">Radio Shack</a> stores and partly because it was less costly, easier to expand, and almost-entirely compatible with the IBM PC. Ironically, the enhanced graphics and sound standards the PCjr pioneered ultimately became known as "Tandy-compatible", with the extended graphics modes eventually coined "TGA" graphics.</p>
<p>IBM returned to the home market in <a href="/wiki/1990.html" title="1990">1990</a> with its much more successful <a href="/wiki/IBM_PS/1.html" title="IBM PS/1">IBM PS/1</a> line. Unlike the PCjr's radical departure from the IBM PC, the PS/1 line concentrated on IBM brand-name compatibility and affordability.</p>
<p>The publication, "PCjr magazine", ran articles written by many of the legends of the computer industry from back in their early days. This comprises a collection of entry level PC articles, from such people as Peter Norton, that could be considered mentionable.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Trivia">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Trivia" id="Trivia"></a></p>
<h2>Trivia</h2>
<p>The PCjr's code name was "peanut", and it was referred to as such by several trade magazines both before and slightly after the PCjr's debut.</p>
<p>The popular <a href="/wiki/1980s.html" title="1980s">1980s</a> adventure game series <i><a href="/wiki/King%27s_Quest.html" title="King's Quest">King's Quest</a></i> was originally developed for the PCjr, as IBM had commissioned <a href="/wiki/Sierra_On-Line.html" title="Sierra On-Line">Sierra On-Line</a> for a game that would take advantage of the PCjr's expanded graphics and sound capabilities for the product's launch.</p>
<p>The cartridge BASIC for the PCjr gave the advantage of a real programming language always ready without taking up system memory, as it was firmware, with its own address space. It would interpret on the fly with speeds close to what could be achieved with use of the IBM BASIC compiler, partially due to the fact that code hosted in <a href="/wiki/ROM.html" title="ROM">ROM</a> executed faster than code stored in <a href="/wiki/RAM.html" title="RAM">RAM</a>. This made the PCjr an ideal development platform for BASIC programmers doing ad hoc data processing.</p>
<p>The two front cartridge slots were also used with third-party cartridges to update the system BIOS and other firmware. Multiple patches from various vendors were included on a single "combo-cartridge" used to support add-on hardware, bypass certain limitations of design, and keep up with changing OS requirements.</p>
<p>The PCjr was manufactured in Lewisburg, TN by Teledyne. Roughly 500,000 units were shipped.</p>
<p>The internal name used for the first prototype was "Green Dragon".</p>
<p>Several upgrades for the PCjr were designed by IBM/Teledyne but never reached the store shelves before the IBM PCjr was canceled. These included a wireless joystick and various memory/drive upgrades.</p>
<p>Other than the Tandy 1000 and Amstrad IBM PC compatible lines a few years later, the dual built-in joystick ports introduced by the PCjr never became standard on IBM PC compatibles, and haven't been seen since.</p>
<p>Most programs prepared for the cartridge format were entertainment titles, but a limited amount of business software was also available on cartridge, including a PCjr version of <a href="/wiki/Lotus_1-2-3.html" title="Lotus 1-2-3">Lotus 1-2-3</a> and <a href="/wiki/Andrew_Tobias.html" title="Andrew Tobias">Andrew Tobias</a>' Managing Your Money.</p>
<p>The lightpen port was later used in combination with the serial port to attach an optic mouse. <sup title="The text in the vicinity of this tag needs citation." class="noprint">[<a  title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><i>citation&#160;needed</i></a>]</sup></p>
<p>The PCjr could be purchased with full manuals that included BIOS source code and all hardware schematics. This made hobby/home modifications easier and led to a number of small hardware upgrade companies providing hardware expansions and modifications (usually for compatibility). Most of these companies were eventually absorbed by PC Enterprises.</p>
