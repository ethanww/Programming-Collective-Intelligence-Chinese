During the reign of <a href="/wiki/Charles_I_of_Spain.html" title="Charles I of Spain">Emperor Charles V (Carlos I of Spain)</a>, who ascended the thrones of the kingdoms of Spain after the death of his grandfather Ferdinand, <b>Habsburg Spain</b> controlled territory ranging from <a href="/wiki/Philippines.html" title="Philippines">Philippines</a> to the <a href="/wiki/Netherlands.html" title="Netherlands">Netherlands</a>, and was, for a time, <a href="/wiki/Europe.html" title="Europe">Europe</a>'s greatest power. For this reason, this period of Spanish history has also been referred to as the "<b>Age of Expansion</b>". Although usually associated with its role in the history of <a href="/wiki/Central_Europe.html" title="Central Europe">Central Europe</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Habsburg.html" title="Habsburg">Habsburg</a> family extended its realm into <a href="/wiki/Spain.html" title="Spain">Spain</a> from 1516 to 1700, where the Habsburg senior line reigned for that period. Under Habsburg rule, Spain reached the zenith of its influence and power, but also began its slow decline.</p>
<p>Spain's <a href="/wiki/16th_century.html" title="16th century">16th century</a> maritime supremacy was demonstrated by the victory over the <a href="/wiki/Ottoman_Empire.html" title="Ottoman Empire">Ottomans</a> at <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Lepanto_%281571%29.html" title="Battle of Lepanto (1571)">Lepanto</a> in 1571 (which was symbolically important to the Spanish), and then after the setback of the <a href="/wiki/Spanish_Armada.html" title="Spanish Armada">Spanish Armada</a> in 1588, in a series of victories against <a href="/wiki/England.html" title="England">England</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Anglo-Spanish_War_%281585%29.html" title="Anglo-Spanish War (1585)">Anglo-Spanish War</a> of 1585-1604. However during the middle decades of the <a href="/wiki/17th_century.html" title="17th century">17th century</a> Habsburg Spain's maritime power went into a long decline with mounting defeats against the <a href="/wiki/Dutch_Republic.html" title="Dutch Republic">United Provinces</a> and then England; that by the 1660s it was struggling grimly to defend its overseas possessions from <a href="/wiki/Pirates.html" title="Pirates">pirates</a> and <a href="/wiki/Privateers.html" title="Privateers">privateers</a>. On land Habsburg Spain became embroiled in the vast <a href="/wiki/Thirty_Years%27_War.html" title="Thirty Years' War">Thirty Years' War</a>, and in the second half of the 17th century the Spanish were defeated by the <a href="/wiki/France.html" title="France">French</a>, led by <a href="/wiki/Louis_XIV_of_France.html" title="Louis XIV of France">King Louis XIV</a>. Habsburg rule came to an end in Spain with the death in 1700 of <a href="/wiki/Charles_II_of_Spain.html" title="Charles II of Spain">Charles II</a> which resulted in the <a href="/wiki/War_of_the_Spanish_Succession.html" title="War of the Spanish Succession">War of the Spanish Succession</a>.</p>
<p>The Habsburg years were also a <a href="/wiki/Spanish_Golden_Age.html" title="Spanish Golden Age">Spanish Golden Age</a> of <a href="/wiki/Culture_of_Spain.html" title="Culture of Spain">cultural efflorescence</a>.

<p>Spain as we know it today had first become united after the 1469 marriage of <a href="/wiki/Ferdinand_II_of_Aragon.html" title="Ferdinand II of Aragon">Ferdinand II of Aragon</a> and <a href="/wiki/Isabella_of_Castile.html" title="Isabella of Castile">Isabella of Castile</a>, and their subsequent conquest of <a href="/wiki/Granada.html" title="Granada">Granada</a>. In 1504, <a href="/wiki/Isabella_of_Castile.html" title="Isabella of Castile">Queen Isabella</a> died, and although Ferdinand tried to maintain his position over Castile in the wake of her death, the Castilian <a href="/wiki/Cortes_Generales.html" title="Cortes Generales">Cortes Generales</a> (the <a href="/wiki/Noble_court.html" title="Noble court">royal court</a> of Spain) chose to crown Isabella's daughter <a href="/wiki/Joanna_of_Castile.html" title="Joanna of Castile">Joanna</a> queen. Her husband Philip was the Habsburg son of the <a href="/wiki/Holy_Roman_Emperor.html" title="Holy Roman Emperor">Holy Roman Emperor</a> <a href="/wiki/Maximilian_I%2C_Holy_Roman_Emperor.html" title="Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor">Maximilian I</a> and <a href="/wiki/Mary_of_Burgundy.html" title="Mary of Burgundy">Mary of Burgundy</a> and simultaneously became king-consort <a href="/wiki/Philip_I_of_Castile.html" title="Philip I of Castile">Philip I of Castile</a>. Shortly thereafter Joanna began to lapse into insanity. In 1506, Philip assumed the regency on her behalf, but he died later that year under mysterious circumstances, possibly poisoned by his father-in-law <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.xs4all.nl/~kvenjb/madmonarchs/juana/juana_bio.htm">[1]</a>. Since their oldest son Charles was only six, the Cortes reluctantly allowed Joanna's father Ferdinand to rule the country as the regent of Joanna and Charles.</p>
<p>Spain was now united under a single ruler, <a href="/wiki/Ferdinand_II_of_Aragon.html" title="Ferdinand II of Aragon">Ferdinand II of Aragon</a>. As sole monarch, Ferdinand adopted a more aggressive policy than he had as Isabella's husband, enlarging Spain's sphere of influence in Italy, strengthening it against France. As ruler of <a href="/wiki/Aragon.html" title="Aragon">Aragon</a>, Ferdinand had been involved in the struggle against France and <a href="/wiki/Venice.html" title="Venice">Venice</a> for control of Italy; these conflicts became the center of Ferdinand's foreign policy as king. Ferdinand's first investment of Spanish forces came in the <a href="/wiki/War_of_the_League_of_Cambrai.html" title="War of the League of Cambrai">War of the League of Cambrai</a> against Venice, where the Spanish soldiers distinguished themselves on the field alongside their French allies at the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Agnadello.html" title="Battle of Agnadello">Battle of Agnadello</a> (1509). Only a year later, Ferdinand joined the <a href="/wiki/Catholic_League_%28Italian%29.html" title="Catholic League (Italian)">Holy League</a> against France, seeing a chance at taking both <a href="/wiki/Naples.html" title="Naples">Naples</a> - to which he held a dynastic claim - and <a href="/wiki/Navarre.html" title="Navarre">Navarra</a>, which was claimed through his marriage to Germaine de Foix. The war was less of a success than that against Venice, and in 1516, France agreed to a truce that left Milan under French control and recognized Spanish hegemony in northern Navarre. Unfortunately Ferdinand died later that year.</p>
<p>Ferdinand's death led to the ascension of young Charles to the throne as <a href="/wiki/Charles_I_of_Spain.html" title="Charles I of Spain">Charles I of Castile and Aragon</a>, effectively founding the <a href="/wiki/Monarchy_of_Spain.html" title="Monarchy of Spain">monarchy of Spain</a>. His Spanish inheritance included all the Spanish possessions in the <a href="/wiki/New_World.html" title="New World">New World</a> and around the Mediterranean. Upon the death of his Habsburg father in 1506, Charles had inherited the Netherlands and <a href="/wiki/Franche-Comt%C3%A9.html" title="Franche-ComtÃ©">Franche-ComtÃ©</a>, growing up in Flanders. In 1519, with the death of his paternal grandfather <a href="/wiki/Maximilian_I%2C_Holy_Roman_Emperor.html" title="Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor">Maximilian I</a>, Charles inherited the Habsburg territories in <a href="/wiki/Germany.html" title="Germany">Germany</a>, and was duly <a href="/wiki/Prince-elector.html" title="Prince-elector">elected</a> <a href="/wiki/Charles_V%2C_Holy_Roman_Emperor.html" title="Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor">Emperor Charles V</a> that year. His mother remained as titular queen of Castile until her death 1555, but due to her health, Charles (titled there as king also) exercised all true power. At that point, <a href="/wiki/Charles_V%2C_Holy_Roman_Emperor.html" title="Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor">Emperor and King Charles</a> was the most powerful man in <a href="/wiki/Christendom.html" title="Christendom">Christendom</a>.</p>
<p>The accumulation of so much power to one man and one dynasty greatly concerned the king of France, <a href="/wiki/Francis_I_of_France.html" title="Francis I of France">Francis I</a>, who found himself surrounded by Habsburg territories. In 1521, Francis invaded the Spanish possessions in Italy and inaugurated a second round of Franco-Spanish conflict. The war was a disaster for France, which suffered defeats at <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Biccoca.html" title="Battle of Biccoca">Biccoca</a> (1522), <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Pavia.html" title="Battle of Pavia">Pavia</a> (1525, at which Francis was captured), and <a  class="new" title="Battle of Landriano">Landriano</a> (1529) before Francis relented and abandoned Milan to Spain once more.</p>

<p>Charlesâs victory at the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Pavia.html" title="Battle of Pavia">Battle of Pavia</a>, 1525, surprised many <a href="/wiki/Italy.html" title="Italy">Italians</a> and <a href="/wiki/Germany.html" title="Germany">Germans</a> and elicited concerns that Charles would endeavor to gain ever greater power. <a href="/wiki/Pope_Clement_VII.html" title="Pope Clement VII">Pope Clement VII</a> switched sides and now joined forces with <a href="/wiki/France.html" title="France">France</a> and prominent Italian states against the <a href="/wiki/Habsburg.html" title="Habsburg">Habsburg</a> <a href="/wiki/Holy_Roman_Emperor.html" title="Holy Roman Emperor">Emperor</a>, in the <a href="/wiki/War_of_the_League_of_Cognac.html" title="War of the League of Cognac">War of the League of Cognac</a>.

<p>The <a href="/wiki/Protestant_Reformation.html" title="Protestant Reformation">Protestant Reformation</a> had begun in Germany in 1517. Charles, through his position as Holy Roman Emperor, his important holdings along Germany's frontiers, and his close relationship with his Habsburg relatives in Austria, had a vested interest in maintaining the stability of the <a href="/wiki/Holy_Roman_Empire.html" title="Holy Roman Empire">Holy Roman Empire</a>. The <a href="/wiki/Peasants%27_War.html" title="Peasants' War">Peasants' War</a> had broken out in Germany in 1524 and ravaged the country until it was brutally put down in 1526. Charles, even as far away from Germany as he was, was committed to keeping order. Since the Peasants' War, the Protestants had organized themselves into a defensive league to protect themselves from Emperor Charles. Under the protection of the Schmalkaldic League, the Protestant states had committed a number of outrages in the eyes of the Catholic Churchâ the confiscation of some ecclesiastical territories, among other thingsâ and had defied the authority of the Emperor.</p>
<p>Perhaps more importantly to the strategy of the Spanish king, the League had allied itself with the French, and efforts in Germany to undermine the League had been rebuffed. Francisâ defeat in 1544 led to the annulment of the alliance with the Protestants, and Charles took advantage of the opportunity. He first tried the path of negotiation at the <a href="/wiki/Council_of_Trent.html" title="Council of Trent">Council of Trent</a> in 1545, but the Protestant leadership, feeling betrayed by the stance taken by the Catholics at the council, went to war, led by the Saxon <a href="/wiki/Elector_of_Saxony.html" title="Elector of Saxony">elector</a> <a href="/wiki/Maurice_of_Saxony.html" title="Maurice of Saxony">Maurice</a>. In response, Charles invaded Germany at the head of a mixed Dutch-Spanish army, hoping to restore the Imperial authority. The emperor personally inflicted a decisive defeat on the Protestants at the historic <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_M%C3%BChlberg.html" title="Battle of MÃ¼hlberg">Battle of MÃ¼hlberg</a> in 1547. In 1555, Charles signed the <a href="/wiki/Peace_of_Augsburg.html" title="Peace of Augsburg">Peace of Augsburg</a> with the Protestant states and restored stability in Germany on his principle of <i><a href="/wiki/Cuius_regio%2C_eius_religio.html" title="Cuius regio, eius religio">cuius regio, eius religio</a></i>, a position unpopular with the Spanish and Italian clergy. Charles' involvement in Germany would establish a role for Spain as protector of the Catholic Habsburg cause in the Holy Roman Empire; the precedent would seven decades later lead to involvement in the war that would decisively end Spain's status as Europe's leading power.</p>
<p>In 1526 Charles married <a  class="new" title="Infanta Isabella">Infanta Isabella</a>, the sister of <a href="/wiki/John_III_of_Portugal.html" title="John III of Portugal">John III of Portugal</a>. In 1556 Charles abdicated from his positions, giving his Spanish empire to his only surviving son, <a href="/wiki/Philip_II_of_Spain.html" title="Philip II of Spain">Philip II of Spain</a>, and the Holy Roman Empire to his brother, Ferdinand. Charles retired to the monastery of <a href="/wiki/Yuste.html" title="Yuste">Yuste</a> (<a href="/wiki/Extremadura.html" title="Extremadura">Extremadura</a>, Spain), where he is thought to have had a <a href="/wiki/Nervous_breakdown.html" title="Nervous breakdown">nervous breakdown</a>, and died in 1558.</p>

<p>Spain was not yet at peace, as the aggressive <a href="/wiki/Henry_II_of_France.html" title="Henry II of France">Henry II of France</a> came to the throne in 1547 and immediately renewed the conflict with Spain.

The <a href="/wiki/Peace_of_Cateau-Cambr%C3%A9sis.html" title="Peace of Cateau-CambrÃ©sis">Peace of Cateau-CambrÃ©sis</a>, signed in 1559, permanently recognized Spanish claims in Italy. In the celebrations that followed the treaty, Henry was killed by a stray splinter from a lance. France was stricken for the next thirty years by civil war and unrest (see <a href="/wiki/French_Wars_of_Religion.html" title="French Wars of Religion">French Wars of Religion</a>) and was unable effectively compete with Spain and the Habsburgs in European power struggle. Freed from any serious French opposition, Spain saw the apogee of its might and territorial reach in the period 1559-1643 .</p>
<p>Charles and his successors, while they may have been most comfortable with and fond of Spain, regarded it as just another part of their empire, rather than nurturing and developing it, as France, England, and the Netherlands might have in their countries. Achieving the political goals of the Habsburg dynasty â which primarily meant undermining the power of France, maintaining Catholic Habsburg hegemony in Germany, and suppressing the Ottoman Empire â was more important to the Habsburg rulers than the welfare of Spain. This emphasis would contribute to the decline of Spanish imperial power.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Spanish_Empire.html" title="Spanish Empire">Spanish Empire</a> had grown substantially since the days of Ferdinand and Isabella. The <a href="/wiki/Aztec_Empire.html" title="Aztec Empire">Aztec</a> and <a href="/wiki/Inca_Empire.html" title="Inca Empire">Inca</a> Empires were conquered during Charles' reign, from 1519 to 1521 and 1540 to 1558, respectively. Spanish settlements were established in the New World: <a href="/wiki/Florida.html" title="Florida">Florida</a> was colonized in the 1560s, <a href="/wiki/Buenos_Aires.html" title="Buenos Aires">Buenos Aires</a> was established in 1536, and <a href="/wiki/New_Granada.html" title="New Granada">New Granada</a> (modern <a href="/wiki/Colombia.html" title="Colombia">Colombia</a>) was colonized in the 1530s. <a href="/wiki/Manila.html" title="Manila">Manila</a>, in the <a href="/wiki/Philippines.html" title="Philippines">Philippines</a>, was established in 1572. The Spanish Empire abroad became the source of Spanish wealth and power in Europe, but contributed also to inflation.

The economic and social revolutions taking place in France and England had no counterparts in Spain.</p>

<p>After Spain's victory over France in 1559 and the beginning of France's religious wars, Philip's ambitions grew. The <a href="/wiki/Ottoman_Empire.html" title="Ottoman Empire">Ottoman Empire</a> had long menaced the fringes of the Habsburg dominions in Austria and northwest Africa, and in response Ferdinand and Isabella had sent expeditions to North Africa, capturing <a href="/wiki/Melilla.html" title="Melilla">Melilla</a> in 1497 and <a href="/wiki/Oran.html" title="Oran">Oran</a> in 1509.

<p>For Spain, the war was a creeping disaster. In 1574, the Spanish army under <a href="/wiki/Luis_de_Reques%C3%A9ns.html" title="Luis de RequesÃ©ns">Luis de RequesÃ©ns</a> was repulsed from the <a href="/wiki/Siege_of_Leiden.html" title="Siege of Leiden">Siege of Leiden</a> after the Dutch destroyed the dykes that held back the North Sea from the low-lying provinces.

The army in the Netherlands mutinied not long after, seizing <a href="/wiki/Antwerp.html" title="Antwerp">Antwerp</a> and looting the southern Netherlands, prompting several cities in the previously peaceful southern provinces to join the rebellion.

<p>The Arras agreement required all Spanish troops to leave these lands.

The <a href="/wiki/Spanish_Armada.html" title="Spanish Armada">Spanish Armada</a> (1588)</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>To keep Portugal under control required an extensive occupation force, and Spain was still reeling from the 1576 bankruptcy. In 1584, William the Silent was assassinated by a half-deranged Catholic, and the death of the popular Dutch resistance leader was expected to bring an end to the war; it did not. In 1586, Queen <a href="/wiki/Elizabeth_I_of_England.html" title="Elizabeth I of England">Elizabeth I of England</a>, supported the Protestant cause in the Netherlands and France, and <a href="/wiki/Sir_Francis_Drake.html" title="Sir Francis Drake">Sir Francis Drake</a> launched attacks against Spanish merchants in the <a href="/wiki/Caribbean.html" title="Caribbean">Caribbean</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Pacific_Ocean.html" title="Pacific Ocean">Pacific Ocean</a>, along with a particularly aggressive attack on the port of <a href="/wiki/Cadiz.html" title="Cadiz">Cadiz</a>. In 1588, hoping to put a stop to Elizabethâs meddling, Philip sent the <a href="/wiki/Spanish_Armada.html" title="Spanish Armada">Spanish Armada</a> to attack England. Of the 130 ships sent on the mission, only half returned safely to Spain, and some 20,000 troops perished. Some were victims of English ships, but most were victims of severe weather encountered on their return trip. The disastrous outcome, resulting from a combination of the unfavorable weather and a good deal of luck for the English under <a href="/wiki/Lord_Howard_of_Effingham.html" title="Lord Howard of Effingham">Lord Howard of Effingham</a>, resulted in a complete overhaul of the Spanish navy's ships, weapons and tactics. It struck back at English attacks and with the help of a bungled English counter attack (<a href="/wiki/English_Armada.html" title="English Armada">English Armada</a>) quickly recovered its preeminent position which it maintained for another half of a century. Spain also provided support to a gruelling Irish war which drained England of resources and also raided English coastal towns. However now the Spanish Habsburgs had yet another powerful enemy with which to contend, forcing Spain to maintain an even stronger, more expensive navy, atop of massive expenditures for its armies in its many scattered territories.</p>
<p>Spain had invested itself in the religious warfare in France after Henry IIâs death. In 1589, <a href="/wiki/Henry_III_of_France.html" title="Henry III of France">Henry III</a>, the last of the <a href="/wiki/Valois_Dynasty.html" title="Valois Dynasty">Valois</a> lineage, died at the walls of Paris. His successor, <a href="/wiki/Henry_IV_of_France.html" title="Henry IV of France">Henry III of Navarre</a>, the first <a href="/wiki/Bourbon_Dynasty.html" title="Bourbon Dynasty">Bourbon</a> king of France, was a man of great ability, winning key victories against the <a href="/wiki/Catholic_League.html" title="Catholic League">Catholic League</a> at <a  class="new" title="Battle of Arques">Arques</a> (1589) and <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Ivry.html" title="Battle of Ivry">Ivry</a> (1590). Committed to stopping Henry from becoming King of France, the Spanish divided their army in the Netherlands and invaded France in 1590.</p>

<h2>"God is Spanish" (1596-1626)</h2>
<p>Faced with wars against England, France, and the Netherlands, each led by extraordinarily capable leaders, already-bankrupted Spain was outmatched. Struggling with continuing piracy against its shipping in the <a href="/wiki/Atlantic.html" title="Atlantic">Atlantic</a> and the disruption of its vital gold shipments from the New World, Spain was forced to admit bankruptcy again in 1596. The Spanish attempted to extricate themselves from the several conflicts they were involved in, first signing the <a href="/wiki/Treaty_of_Vervins.html" title="Treaty of Vervins">Treaty of Vervins</a> with France in 1598, recognizing Henry IV (since 1593 a Catholic) as king of France, and restoring many of the stipulations of the previous <a href="/wiki/Peace_of_Cateau-Cambr%C3%A9sis.html" title="Peace of Cateau-CambrÃ©sis">Peace of Cateau-CambrÃ©sis</a>.

<p>Peace with England and France implied that Spain could focus her energies on restoring her rule to the Dutch provinces. The Dutch, led by <a href="/wiki/Maurice_of_Nassau.html" title="Maurice of Nassau">Maurice of Nassau</a>, the son of William the Silent and perhaps the greatest strategist of his time, had succeeded in taking a number of border cities since 1590, including the fortress of <a href="/wiki/Breda_%28Netherlands%29.html" title="Breda (Netherlands)">Breda</a>. Following the peace with England, the new Spanish commander <a href="/wiki/Ambrosio_Spinola.html" title="Ambrosio Spinola">Ambrosio Spinola</a> pressed hard against the Dutch. Spinola, a general of abilities to match Maurice, was prevented from conquering the Netherlands only by Spainâs renewed bankruptcy in 1607. Faced with ruined finances, in 1609, the <a href="/wiki/Twelve_Years%27_Truce.html" title="Twelve Years' Truce">Twelve Years' Truce</a> was signed between Spain and the <a href="/wiki/Dutch_Republic.html" title="Dutch Republic">United Provinces</a>.</p>
<p>Spain made a fair recovery during the truce, ordering her finances and doing much to restore her prestige and stability in the run-up to the last truly great war in which she would play as a leading power. In the Netherlands, the rule of Philip II's daughter, <a href="/wiki/Infanta_Isabella_Clara_Eugenia_of_Spain.html" title="Infanta Isabella Clara Eugenia of Spain">Isabella Clara Eugenia</a> and her husband, <a href="/wiki/Archduke_Albert_%281559-1621%29.html" title="Archduke Albert (1559-1621)">Archduke Albert</a>, restored stability to the southern Netherlands and pacified anti-Spanish sentiments in the area. Philip IIâs successor, <a href="/wiki/Philip_III_of_Spain.html" title="Philip III of Spain">Philip III</a>, was a man of limited ability uninterested in politics, preferring to allow others to take care of the details. His chief minister was the capable <a href="/wiki/Francisco_Gom%C3%A9z_de_Sandoval_y_Rojas%2C_Duke_of_Lerma.html" title="Francisco GomÃ©z de Sandoval y Rojas, Duke of Lerma">Duke of Lerma</a>.

<p>In 1618, beginning with the <a href="/wiki/Defenestration_of_Prague.html" title="Defenestration of Prague">Defenestration of Prague</a>, Austria and the Holy Roman Emperor, <a href="/wiki/Ferdinand_II_of_Germany.html" title="Ferdinand II of Germany">Ferdinand II of Germany</a>, embarked on a campaign against the <a href="/wiki/Protestant_Union.html" title="Protestant Union">Protestant Union</a> and <a href="/wiki/Bohemia.html" title="Bohemia">Bohemia</a>. ZÃºÃ±iga encouraged Philip to join the Austrian Habsburgs in the war, and Ambrogio Spinola, the rising star of the Spanish army, was sent at the head of the <a  class="new" title="Army of Flanders">Army of Flanders</a> to intervene. Thus, Spain entered into the <a href="/wiki/Thirty_Years%E2%80%99_War.html" title="Thirty Yearsâ War">Thirty Yearsâ War</a>.</p>
<p>In 1621, the inoffensive and ineffective Philip III was replaced by the considerably more active and pious <a href="/wiki/Philip_IV_of_Spain.html" title="Philip IV of Spain">Philip IV</a>. The following year, ZÃºÃ±iga was replaced by <a href="/wiki/Gaspar_de_Guzm%C3%A1n_y_Pimentel%2C_Count-Duke_of_Olivares.html" title="Gaspar de GuzmÃ¡n y Pimentel, Count-Duke of Olivares">Gaspar de GuzmÃ¡n y Pimentel, Count-Duke of Olivares</a>, an able man who believed that the center of all Spainâs woes rest in Holland. After certain initial setbacks, the Bohemians were defeated at <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_White_Mountain.html" title="Battle of White Mountain">White Mountain</a> in 1621, and again at <a href="/wiki/Stadtlohn.html" title="Stadtlohn">Stadtlohn</a> in 1623. The war with the Netherlands was renewed in 1621 with Spinola taking the fortress of <a href="/wiki/Siege_of_Breda.html" title="Siege of Breda">Breda</a> in 1625. The intervention of the Danish king <a href="/wiki/Christian_IV_of_Denmark.html" title="Christian IV of Denmark">Christian IV</a> in the war worried some (Christian was one of Europeâs few monarchs who had no worries over his finances) but the victory of the Imperial general <a href="/wiki/Albert_of_Wallenstein.html" title="Albert of Wallenstein">Albert of Wallenstein</a> over the Danes at <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Dessau_Bridge.html" title="Battle of Dessau Bridge">Dessau Bridge</a> and again at <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Lutter.html" title="Battle of Lutter">Lutter</a>, both in 1626, eliminated the threat. There was hope in Madrid that the Netherlands might finally be reincorporated into the Empire, and after the defeat of Denmark the Protestants in Germany seemed subdued. France was once again involved in her own instabilities (the famous <a href="/wiki/Siege_of_La_Rochelle.html" title="Siege of La Rochelle">Siege of La Rochelle</a> began in 1627), and Spain's eminence seemed irrefutable. The Count-Duke Olivares stridently affirmed âGod is Spanish and fights for our nation these days,â (Brown and Elliott, 1980, p. 190) and many of Spainâs opponents may have grudgingly agreed.</p>

<p>Olivares was a man sadly out of time; he realized that Spain needed to reform, and to reform it needed peace. The destruction of the United Provinces of the Netherlands was added to his list of necessities because behind every anti-Habsburg coalition there was Dutch money: Dutch bankers stood behind the East India merchants of Seville, and everywhere in the world Dutch entrepreneurship and colonists undermined Spanish and Portuguese hegemony. Spinola and the Spanish army were focused on the Netherlands, and the war seemed to be going in Spain's favor.</p>
<p>In 1627, the Castilian economy collapsed. The Spanish had been <a href="/wiki/Debasement.html" title="Debasement">debasing</a> their currency to pay for the war and <a href="/wiki/Inflation.html" title="Inflation">prices exploded</a> in Spain just as they had in previous years in Austria. Until 1631, parts of Castile operated on a <a href="/wiki/Barter.html" title="Barter">barter</a> economy as a result of the currency crisis, and the government was unable to collect any meaningful taxes from the peasantry, depending instead on its colonies (<a href="/wiki/Spanish_treasure_fleet.html" title="Spanish treasure fleet">Spanish treasure fleet</a>). The Spanish armies in Germany resorted to "paying themselves" on the land. Olivares, who had backed certain tax measures in Spain pending the completion of the war, was further blamed for an embarrassing and fruitless war in Italy (see <a href="/wiki/War_of_the_Mantuan_Succession.html" title="War of the Mantuan Succession">War of the Mantuan Succession</a>). The Dutch, who during the Twelve Yearsâ Truce had made their navy a priority, devastated Spanish and (especially) Portuguese maritime trade, on which Spain was wholly dependent after the economic collapse. The Spanish, with resources stretched thin, were increasingly unable to cope with the rapidly growing naval threats.</p>
<p>In 1630, <a href="/wiki/Gustavus_Adolphus.html" title="Gustavus Adolphus">Gustavus Adolphus</a> of Sweden, one of the most able commanders of the time, landed in Germany and relieved the port of <a href="/wiki/Stralsund.html" title="Stralsund">Stralsund</a> that was the last stronghold on the continent held by German forces belligerent to the Emperor. Gustav then marched south winning notable victories at <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Breitenfeld_%281631%29.html" title="Battle of Breitenfeld (1631)">Breitenfeld</a> and <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_L%C3%BCtzen_%281632%29.html" title="Battle of LÃ¼tzen (1632)">Lutzen</a>, attracting greater support for the Protestant cause the further he went. The situation for the Catholics improved with Gustav's death at Lutzen in 1632 and a shocking victory for Imperial forces under <a href="/wiki/Cardinal-Infante_Ferdinand.html" title="Cardinal-Infante Ferdinand">Cardinal-Infante Ferdinand</a> and <a href="/wiki/Ferdinand_III%2C_Holy_Roman_Emperor.html" title="Ferdinand III, Holy Roman Emperor">Ferdinand II of Hungary</a> at <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Nordlingen.html" title="Battle of Nordlingen">Nordlingen</a> in 1634. From a position of strength, the Emperor approached the war-weary German states with a peace in 1635; many accepted, including the two most powerful, <a href="/wiki/Brandenburg.html" title="Brandenburg">Brandenburg</a> and <a href="/wiki/Saxony.html" title="Saxony">Saxony</a>.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Cardinal_Richelieu.html" title="Cardinal Richelieu">Cardinal Richelieu</a> had been a strong supporter of the Dutch and Protestants since the beginning of the war, sending funds and equipment in an attempt to stem Habsburg strength in Europe. Richelieu decided that the recently-signed <a href="/wiki/Peace_of_Prague_%281635%29.html" title="Peace of Prague (1635)">Peace of Prague</a> was contrary to French interests and declared war on the Holy Roman Emperor and Spain within months of the peace being signed. The more experienced Spanish forces scored initial successes; Olivares ordered a lightning campaign into northern France from the Spanish Netherlands, hoping to shatter the resolve of <a href="/wiki/Louis_XIII_of_France.html" title="Louis XIII of France">King Louis XIII</a>'s ministers and topple Richelieu before the war exhausted Spanish finances and France's military resources could be fully deployed. In the <i>"annÃ©e de Corbie"</i>, 1636, Spanish forces advanced as far south as <a href="/wiki/Amiens.html" title="Amiens">Amiens</a> and <a href="/wiki/Corbie.html" title="Corbie">Corbie</a>, threatening <a href="/wiki/Paris.html" title="Paris">Paris</a> and quite nearly ending the war on their terms.</p>

<p>After 1636, however, Olivares, fearful of provoking another disastrous bankruptcy, stopped the advance. The Spanish army would never again penetrate. The French thus gained time to properly mobilise. At the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_the_Downs.html" title="Battle of the Downs">Battle of the Downs</a> in 1639 a Spanish fleet was destroyed by the Dutch navy, and the Spanish found themselves unable to adequately reinforce and supply their forces in the Netherlands.

<p>War with France continued for eleven more years. Although France suffered from a civil war from 1648-1652 (see <a href="/wiki/Fronde.html" title="Fronde">Wars of the Fronde</a>) the Spanish economy was so exhausted that they were unable to capitalize on French instability. Naples was retaken in 1648 and <a href="/wiki/Catalonia.html" title="Catalonia">Catalonia</a> in 1652, but the war came effectively to an end at the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_the_Dunes_%281658%29.html" title="Battle of the Dunes (1658)">Battle of the Dunes</a> where the French army under Vicomte de <a href="/wiki/Turenne.html" title="Turenne">Turenne</a> defeated the remnants of the Spanish army of the Netherlands.

<p>Philip IV, who had seen over the course of his life the devastation of Spain's empire, sank slowly into depression after he had to dismiss his favorite courtier, Olivares, in 1643. He was saddened further after the death of his son <a href="/wiki/Baltasar_Carlos.html" title="Baltasar Carlos">Baltasar Carlos</a> in 1646 at the young age of seventeen. Philip became increasingly mystical near the end of his life, and ultimately attempted to undo some of the damage he had done to his country. He died in 1665 before anything could be changed, hoping his son might somehow be more fortunate. <a href="/wiki/Charles_II_of_Spain.html" title="Charles II of Spain">Charles</a>, his only surviving son, was seriously deformed and mentally retarded, and remained under the influence of his mother all his life. Struggling with his deformities and the expectations and ridicule of his family and the court, Charles led a miserable existence.</p>
<p>Charles and his regency were incompetent in dealing with the <a href="/wiki/War_of_Devolution.html" title="War of Devolution">War of Devolution</a> that <a href="/wiki/Louis_XIV_of_France.html" title="Louis XIV of France">Louis XIV of France</a> prosecuted against the Spanish Netherlands in 1667-1668, losing considerable prestige and territory, including the cities of <a href="/wiki/Lille.html" title="Lille">Lille</a> and <a href="/wiki/Charleroi.html" title="Charleroi">Charleroi</a>. In the <a href="/wiki/Nine_Years%27_War.html" title="Nine Years' War">Nine Years' War</a> Louis once again invaded the Spanish Netherlands. French forces led by the <a href="/wiki/Fran%C3%A7ois_Henri_de_Montmorency-Bouteville%2C_duc_de_Luxembourg.html" title="FranÃ§ois Henri de Montmorency-Bouteville, duc de Luxembourg">Duke of Luxembourg</a> defeated the Spanish at <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Fleurus_%281690%29.html" title="Battle of Fleurus (1690)">Fleurus</a> (1690), and subsequently defeated Dutch forces under <a href="/wiki/William_III_of_Orange.html" title="William III of Orange">William III</a>, who fought on Spain's side. The war ended with most of the Spanish Netherlands under French occupation, including the important cities of <a href="/wiki/Ghent.html" title="Ghent">Ghent</a> and <a href="/wiki/Luxembourg.html" title="Luxembourg">Luxembourg</a>. The war revealed to the world how vulnerable and backward the Spanish defenses and bureaucracy were, though the ineffective Spanish government took no action to improve them.</p>

The Spanish bureaucracy that had built up around the charismatic, industrious, and intelligent Charles I and Philip II demanded a strong monarch; the weakness of Philip III and IV led to Spain's decay. As his final wishes, the childless king of Spain desired that the throne pass to the Bourbon prince <a href="/wiki/Philip_V_of_Spain.html" title="Philip V of Spain">Philip of Anjou</a>, rather than to a member of the family that had tormented him throughout his life. Charles II died in 1700, ending the line of Spanish Habsburgs exactly two centuries after Charles I was born.</p>

<p>The <a href="/wiki/Spanish_Inquisition.html" title="Spanish Inquisition">Spanish Inquisition</a> was formally launched during the reign of the <a href="/wiki/Catholic_Monarchs.html" title="Catholic Monarchs">Catholic Monarchs</a>, continued by their <a href="/wiki/Habsburg.html" title="Habsburg">Habsburg</a> successors, and only ended in the nineteenth century. Under <a href="/wiki/Charles_I_of_Spain.html" title="Charles I of Spain">Charles I</a> the inquisition became a formal department in the Spanish government, hurtling out of control as the sixteenth century progressed. Charles also passed the <i><a  class="new" title="Limpieza">Limpieza</a></i>, a law that excluded those not of pure Old Christian, non-Jewish blood from public office. Although torture was common in Europe, the way the Inquisition was practiced encouraged corruption and betrayal, and it became a driving factor in the decay of Spanish power. It became a method for enemies, jealous friends and even quarreling relations to usurp influence and property. An accusation, even if largely unfounded, led to a long and agonizing trial that might take years before coming to a verdict, during which time the accused's reputation and esteem was destroyed. The notorious <i><a href="/wiki/Auto_de_fe.html" title="Auto de fe">auto de fe</a></i> was a combination of public humiliation of the repentant and a gross spectacle of human torture for the "guilty".</p>
<p>Although Charles continued the practice of the inquisition, <a href="/wiki/Philip_II_of_Spain.html" title="Philip II of Spain">Philip II</a> greatly expanded it and made church orthodoxy a goal of public policy. In 1559, three years after Philip came to power, students in Spain were forbidden to travel abroad, the leaders of the Inquisition were placed in charge of censorship, and books could no longer be imported. Philip vigorously tried to excise Protestantism out of Spain, holding innumerable campaigns to eliminate <a href="/wiki/Lutheran.html" title="Lutheran">Lutheran</a> and <a href="/wiki/Calvinist.html" title="Calvinist">Calvinist</a> literature from the country, hoping to avoid the chaos taking place in France.</p>
<p>The church in Spain had been purged of many of its administrative excesses in the fifteenth century by <a href="/wiki/Francisco_Xim%C3%A9nez_de_Cisneros.html" title="Francisco XimÃ©nez de Cisneros">Cardinal Ximenes</a>, and the Inquisition served to expurgate many of the more radical reformers who sought to change church theology as the Protestant reformers wanted. Instead, Spain became the scion of the <a href="/wiki/Counter-reformation.html" title="Counter-reformation">Counter-reformation</a> as it emerged from the <a href="/wiki/Reconquista.html" title="Reconquista">Reconquista</a>. Spain bred two unique threads of counter-reformationary thought in the persons of Saint <a href="/wiki/Theresa_of_Avila.html" title="Theresa of Avila">Theresa of Avila</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Basque_people.html" title="Basque people">Basque</a> <a href="/wiki/Ignatius_Loyola.html" title="Ignatius Loyola">Ignatius Loyola</a>. Theresa advocated strict <a href="/wiki/Monasticism.html" title="Monasticism">monasticism</a> and a revival of more ancient traditions of penitence. She experienced a <a href="/wiki/Religious_ecstasy.html" title="Religious ecstasy">mystical ecstasy</a> that became profoundly influential on Spanish culture and art. Ignatius Loyola, founder of the <a href="/wiki/Jesuit.html" title="Jesuit">Jesuit</a> Order, was influential across the world in his stress on spiritual and mental excellence and contributed to a resurgence of learning across Europe. In 1625, a peak of Spanish prestige and power, the <a href="/wiki/Gaspar_de_Guzman%2C_conde_de_Olivares.html" title="Gaspar de Guzman, conde de Olivares">Count-Duke of Olivares</a> established the Jesuit <i><a  class="new" title="Colegia imperial">colegia imperial</a></i> in Madrid to train Spanish nobles in the humanities and military arts.</p>

<p>The <a href="/wiki/Morisco.html" title="Morisco">Moriscos</a> of southern Spain had been forcibly converted to Christianity in 1502, but under the rule of Charles I they had been able to obtain a degree of tolerance from their Christian rulers. They were allowed to practice their former custom, dress, and language, and religious laws were laxly enforced. In 1568, however, under Philip, the Moriscos rebelled (see <a href="/wiki/Morisco_Revolt.html" title="Morisco Revolt">Morisco Revolt</a>) after the old laws were enforced again. The revolt was only put down by Italian troops under <a href="/wiki/Don_John_of_Austria.html" title="Don John of Austria">Don John of Austria</a>, and even then the Moriscos retreated to the highlands and were not defeated until 1570. The revolt was followed by a massive resettlement program in which 12,000 Christian peasants replaced the Moriscos. In 1609, on the advice of the <a href="/wiki/Francisco_Gom%C3%A9z_de_Sandoval_y_Rojas%2C_Duke_of_Lerma.html" title="Francisco GomÃ©z de Sandoval y Rojas, Duke of Lerma">Duke of Lerma</a>, <a href="/wiki/Philip_III_of_Spain.html" title="Philip III of Spain">Philip III</a> expelled the 300,000 Moriscos of Spain.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Age_of_Enlightenment.html" title="Age of Enlightenment">Enlightenment</a> chiefly critiqued the Spanish for excessive religious zeal and "laziness". Among the members of the aristocracy, who enjoyed increasing security in their positions of power (unlike their colleagues in France and England who were increasingly competitive) the argument of "Spanish sloth" might apply. The expulsion of the industrious Moriscos and Jews certainly did little to help the Spanish economy and society that relied on their work and expertise far more than the Christians realized.</p>

<p>The Spanish received a massive influx of gold from the colonies in the New World as plunder when they were conquered, much of which Charles used to prosecute his wars in Europe. It was not until the 1540s that large deposits of silver were found in <a href="/wiki/San_Luis_Potos%C3%AD.html" title="San Luis PotosÃ­">PotosÃ­</a> and <a href="/wiki/Guanajuato.html" title="Guanajuato">Guanajuato</a> and a steady source of income was obtained. The Spanish left mining to private enterprise but instituted a tax known as the "<i>quinto real</i>" whereby a fifth of the metal was collected by the government. The Spanish were quite successful in enforcing the tax throughout their vast empire in the New W[[orld; all <a href="/wiki/Bullion.html" title="Bullion">bullion</a> had to pass through the <a  class="new" title="House of Trade">House of Trade</a> in <a href="/wiki/Seville.html" title="Seville">Seville</a>, under the direction of the <a href="/wiki/Council_of_the_Indies.html" title="Council of the Indies">Council of the Indies</a>.

<p>Although the initial conquests in the Americas provided sharp spikes in gold imports from the colonies, it was not until the 1550s that they became a regular and vital source of Spain's income. <a href="/wiki/Inflation.html" title="Inflation">Inflation</a> - both in Spain and in the rest of Europe - was primarily caused by debt; Charles had conducted most of his wars on credit, and in 1557, a year after he abdicated, Spain was forced into its first <a href="/wiki/Bankruptcy.html" title="Bankruptcy">bankruptcy</a>.</p>

<p>Faced with the growing threat of <a href="/wiki/Piracy.html" title="Piracy">piracy</a>, in 1564 the Spanish adopted a convoy system far ahead of its time, with <a href="/wiki/Treasure_fleet.html" title="Treasure fleet">treasure fleets</a> leaving the Americas in April and August. The policy proved efficient, and was quite successful. Only two convoys were captured; one in 1628 when it was captured by the Dutch, and another in 1656, captured by the English. Nevertheless even without being completely captured they frequently came under attack, which inevitably took its toll. However not all shipping of the dispersed empire could be protected by large convoys, allowing the Dutch, English and French <a href="/wiki/Privateers.html" title="Privateers">privateers</a> and pirates the opportunity to devastate trade along the American and Spanish coastlines and raid isolated settlements. This became particularly savage from the 1650s, with all sides falling to extraordinary levels of barbarity, even by contemporary standards. Spain also had to deal with <a href="/wiki/Barbary_pirates.html" title="Barbary pirates">Barbary piracy</a> in the Mediterranean and Oriental and Dutch piracy in the waters in and around the Philippines.</p>
<p>The growth of Spain's empire in the New World was accomplished from Seville, without the close direction of the leadership in Madrid. Charles I and Philip II were primarily concerned with their duties in Europe, and thus control of the Americas was handled by <a href="/wiki/Viceroy.html" title="Viceroy">viceroys</a> and colonial administrators who operated with virtual autonomy. The Habsburg kings regarded their colonies as feudal associations rather than integral parts of Spain. The Habsburgs, whose family had traditionally ruled over diverse, noncontiguous domains and had been forced to devolve autonomy to local administrators, replicated those feudal policies in Spain, particularly in the <a href="/wiki/Basque_Country_%28historical_territory%29.html" title="Basque Country (historical territory)">Basque country</a> and <a href="/wiki/Aragon.html" title="Aragon">Aragon</a>.</p>
<p>This meant that taxes, infrastructure improvement, and internal trade policy were defined independently by each region, leading to many internal customs barriers and tolls, and conflicting policies even within the Habsburg domains. Charles I and Philip II had been able to master the various courts through their impressive political energy, but Philip III and IV allowed it to decay, and Charles II was wholly incapable of controlling them. The development of Spain itself was hampered by the fact that Charles I and Philip II spent most of their time abroad; for most of the sixteenth century, Spain was administrated from <a href="/wiki/Brussels.html" title="Brussels">Brussels</a> and <a href="/wiki/Antwerp.html" title="Antwerp">Antwerp</a>, and it was only during the <a href="/wiki/Eighty_Years%27_War.html" title="Eighty Years' War">Dutch Revolt</a> that Philip returned to Spain, where he spent most of his time in the seclusion of the monastic palace of <a href="/wiki/El_Escorial.html" title="El Escorial">El Escorial</a>. The patchy empire, held together by a determined king keeping the bloated bureaucracy together, unraveled when a weak ruler came to the throne.</p>
<p>There were attempts to reform the antiquated Spanish bureaucracy. Charles, on becoming king, clashed with his nobles during the <a href="/wiki/Castilian_War_of_the_Communities.html" title="Castilian War of the Communities">Castilian War of the Communities</a> when he attempted to fill government positions with effective Dutch and Flemish officials. Philip II encountered major resistance when he tried to enforce his authority over the Netherlands, contributing to the rebellion in that country. The <a href="/wiki/Gaspar_de_Guzman%2C_Count-Duke_of_Olivares.html" title="Gaspar de Guzman, Count-Duke of Olivares">Count-Duke of Olivares</a>, Philip IV's chief minister, always regarded it as essential to Spain's survival that the bureaucracy be centralized; Olivares even backed the full union of Portugal with Spain, though he never had an opportunity to realize his ideas. After Charles abdicated, the bureaucracy became increasingly bloated and corrupt until, by Olivares's dismissal in 1643, it was rendered obsolete.</p>

<p>Like most of Europe, Spain had suffered from famine and plague during the 14th and 15th centuries. By 1500, Europe was beginning to emerge from these demographic disasters, and populations began to explode - <a href="/wiki/Seville.html" title="Seville">Seville</a>, which was home to 60,000 people in 1500 burgeoned to 150,000 by the end of the century. There was a substantial movement to the cities of Spain to capitalize on new opportunities as shipbuilders and merchants to service Spain's impressive and growing empire.</p>
<p>Inflation in Spain, as a result of state debt and the importation of silver and gold from the New World, triggered hardship for the peasantry. The average cost of goods quintupled in the sixteenth century in Spain, led by wool and grain. While reasonable when compared to the twentieth century, prices in the 15th century changed very little, and the European economy was shaken by the so-called <a href="/wiki/Price_revolution.html" title="Price revolution">price revolution</a>. Spain, along with England was Europe's only producer of wool, initially benefited from the rapid growth. However, like in England, there began in Spain an <a href="/wiki/Inclosure.html" title="Inclosure">inclosure</a> movement that stifled the growth of food and depopulated whole villages whose residents were forced to move to cities. But unlike England, the higher inflation, the burden of the HabsburgÂ´s wars and the many customs duties dividing the country and restricting trade with the Americas, stifled the growth of industry that may have provided an alternative source of income in the towns.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Sheep.html" title="Sheep">Sheep</a>-farming was practiced extensively in Castile, and grew rapidly with rising wool prices with the backing of the king. <a href="/wiki/Merino.html" title="Merino">Merino</a> <a href="/wiki/Sheep.html" title="Sheep">sheep</a> were <a  class="new" title="Transhumancy">annually moved</a> from the mountains of the north to the warmer south every winter, ignoring <a  class="new" title="CaÃ±ada real">state-mandated trails</a> that were intended to prevent the sheep from trampling the farmland. Complaints lodged against the shepherds' guild, the <i><a href="/wiki/Mesta.html" title="Mesta">Mesta</a></i>, were ignored by Philip II who received a great deal of revenue from wool. Eventually, Castile became barren, and Spain was wholly dependent on imported food that, given the cost of transportation and the risk of piracy, was far more expensive in Spain than elsewhere. As a result, Spain's population grew much slower than France's; by Louis XIV's time, France had a population greater than that of Spain and England combined.</p>

<p>Credit emerged as a widespread tool of Spanish business in the sixteenth century. The city of <a href="/wiki/Antwerp.html" title="Antwerp">Antwerp</a>, in the Spanish Netherlands, lay at the heart of European commerce and its bankers financed most of Charles V's and Philip II's wars on credit. The use of "notes of exchange" became common as Antwerp banks became increasingly powerful and led to extensive speculation that helped to exaggerate price shifts. Although these trends laid the foundation for the development of capitalism in Spain and Europe as a whole, the total lack of regulation and pervasive corruption meant that small landowners often lost everything with a single stroke of misfortune. Estates in Spain grew progressively <a href="/wiki/Latifundia.html" title="Latifundia">larger</a> and the economy became increasingly uncompetitive, particularly during the reigns of Philip III and IV when repeated speculative crises shook Spain.</p>
<p>The church had always been important to the Spanish economy, and particularly in the reigns of Philip III and IV, who had bouts of intense personal piety and church philanthropy, large areas of the country were donated to the church. The later Habsburgs did nothing to promote redistribution of land, and by the end of Charles II's reign, most of Castile was in the hands of a select few landowners, the largest of which by far was the Church.</p>

<h2>Spanish art and culture (1516-1700)</h2>
<p><i>Main article: <b><a href="/wiki/Spanish_Golden_Age.html" title="Spanish Golden Age">Spanish Golden Age</a></b></i></p>
<p>The Spanish Golden Age was a flourishing period of arts and letters in Spain which spanned roughly from 1550-1650. Some of the outstanding figures of the period were <a href="/wiki/El_Greco.html" title="El Greco">El Greco</a>, <a href="/wiki/Diego_Vel%C3%A1zquez.html" title="Diego VelÃ¡zquez">Diego VelÃ¡zquez</a>, <a href="/wiki/Miguel_de_Cervantes.html" title="Miguel de Cervantes">Miguel de Cervantes</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Pedro_Calder%C3%B3n_de_la_Barca.html" title="Pedro CalderÃ³n de la Barca">Pedro CalderÃ³n de la Barca</a>.</p>
<p>El Greco and VelÃ¡zquez were both painters, the former most notably recognized for his religious depictions and the latterânow regarded as one of the most important figures in all of Spanish artâfor his precise, realistic portraiture of the contemporary court of Philip IV. Cervantes and de la Barca were both writers; <i><a href="/wiki/Don_Quixote.html" title="Don Quixote">Don Quixote de la Mancha</a></i>, by Cervantes, is one of the most famous works of the period and probably the best-known piece of Spanish literature of all time. It is a parody of the romantic, chivalric aspects of knighthood and a criticism of contemporary social structures and societal norms. <a href="/wiki/Juana_In%C3%A9s_de_la_Cruz.html" title="Juana InÃ©s de la Cruz">Juana InÃ©s de la Cruz</a>, the last great writer of this golden age, died in <a href="/wiki/New_Spain.html" title="New Spain">New Spain</a> in 1695.</p>
