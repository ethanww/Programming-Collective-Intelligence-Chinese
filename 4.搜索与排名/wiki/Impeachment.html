</div>
</div>
<p>In the <a href="/wiki/Constitution.html" title="Constitution">constitutions</a> of several countries, <b>impeachment</b> is the first of two stages in a specific process for a legislative body to remove a <a href="/wiki/Government.html" title="Government">government</a> official without that official's agreement.</p>
<p>Impeachment occurs rarely enough for many in a country to misunderstand its nature. A typical misconception is to confuse it with involuntary removal from office; in fact it is only the legal statement of charges, parallelling an <a href="/wiki/Indictment.html" title="Indictment">indictment</a> in <a href="/wiki/Criminal_law.html" title="Criminal law">criminal law</a>. An official who is impeached faces a second legislative vote (whether by the same body or another), which determines conviction, or failure to convict, on the charges embodied by the impeachment. Most constitutions require a <a href="/wiki/Supermajority.html" title="Supermajority">supermajority</a> to convict.</p>
<p>One tradition of impeachment has its origins in the <a href="/wiki/English_law.html" title="English law">law of England and Wales</a>, where the procedure last took place in <a href="/wiki/1806.html" title="1806">1806</a>. Impeachment exists under constitutional law in many nations around the world, including the <a href="/wiki/United_States.html" title="United States">United States</a>, <a href="/wiki/Brazil.html" title="Brazil">Brazil</a>, <a href="/wiki/Russia.html" title="Russia">Russia</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Philippines.html" title="Philippines">Philippines</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland.html" title="Republic of Ireland">Republic of Ireland</a>.</p>
<p>Etymologically, the word "impeachment" derives from Latin roots expressing the idea of becoming caught or entrapped, and has analogues in the modern French verb <i>empÃªcher</i> (to prevent) and the modern English <i>impede</i>. Medieval popular etymology also associated it (wrongly) with derivations from the Latin <i>impetere</i> (to attack). (In its more frequent and more technical usage, <a href="/wiki/Witness_impeachment.html" title="Witness impeachment">impeachment</a> of a person in the role of a <a href="/wiki/Witness.html" title="Witness">witness</a> is the act challenging the honesty or credibility of that person.)</p>
<p>The process should not be confused with <a href="/wiki/Recall_election.html" title="Recall election">recall election</a>. A recall election is usually initiated by voters and can be based on "political charges", for example mismanagement, whereas impeachment is initiated by a constitutional body (usually a legislative body) and is based on criminal charges. The process of removing the official is also different.</p>

<p><a name="Procedure" id="Procedure"></a></p>
<h3>Procedure</h3>
<p>In the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom.html" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>, the <a href="/wiki/British_House_of_Commons.html" title="British House of Commons">House of Commons</a> holds the power of initiating an impeachment. Any member may make accusations of <a href="/wiki/High_treason.html" title="High treason">high treason</a> or <a href="/wiki/High_crimes_and_misdemeanours.html" title="High crimes and misdemeanours">high crimes and misdemeanours</a>. The member must support the charges with evidence and <a href="/wiki/Motion_%28democracy%29.html" title="Motion (democracy)">move</a> for impeachment. If the Commons carries the motion, the mover receives orders to go to the bar at the <a href="/wiki/House_of_Lords.html" title="House of Lords">House of Lords</a> and to impeach the accused "in the name of the House of Commons, and all the commons of the United Kingdom."</p>
<p>The mover must tell the Lords that the House of Commons will, in due time, exhibit particular articles against the accused, and make good the same. The Commons then usually select a committee to draw up the charges and create an "Article of Impeachment" for each. (In the case of <a href="/wiki/Warren_Hastings.html" title="Warren Hastings">Warren Hastings</a>, however, the drawing up of the articles preceded the formal impeachment.) Once the committee has delivered the articles to the Lords, replies go between the accused and the Commons via the Lords. If the Commons have impeached a peer, the Lords take custody of the accused, otherwise custody goes to <a href="/wiki/Black_Rod.html" title="Black Rod">Black Rod</a>. The accused remains in custody unless the Lords allow bail. The Lords set a date for the trial while the Commons appoints managers, who act as prosecutors in the trial. The accused may defend by <a href="/wiki/Counsel.html" title="Counsel">counsel</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/House_of_Lords.html" title="House of Lords">House of Lords</a> hears the case, with the <a href="/wiki/Lord_Chancellor.html" title="Lord Chancellor">Lord Chancellor</a> presiding (or the <a href="/wiki/Lord_High_Steward.html" title="Lord High Steward">Lord High Steward</a> if the impeachment relates to a <a href="/wiki/Peerage.html" title="Peerage">peer</a> accused of high treason.) The hearing resembles an ordinary trial: both sides may call witnesses and present evidence. At the end of the hearing the Lord Chancellor puts the question on the first article to each member in order of seniority, commencing with the most junior peer, and ending with himself, and after all have voted, proceeds to deal with any remaining articles similarly. Upon being called, a Lord must rise and declare upon his honour, "Guilty" or "Not Guilty". After voting on all of the articles has taken place, and if the Lords find the defendant guilty, the Commons may move for judgment; the Lords may not declare the punishment until the Commons have so moved. The Lords may then provide whatever punishment they find fit, within the law. A Royal <a href="/wiki/Pardon.html" title="Pardon">Pardon</a> cannot excuse the defendant from trial, but a Pardon may reprieve a convicted defendant.</p>

<h3>History</h3>
<p>Parliament has held the power of impeachment since mediÃ¦val times. Originally, the House of Lords held that impeachment could only apply to members of the <a href="/wiki/Peerage.html" title="Peerage">peerage</a> (nobles), as the nobility (the Lords) would try their own peers, while commoners ought to try <i>their</i> peers (other commoners) in a <a href="/wiki/Jury.html" title="Jury">jury</a>. However, in 1681, the Commons declared that they had the right to impeach whomsoever they pleased, and the Lords have respected this resolution.</p>
<p>After the reign of <a href="/wiki/Edward_IV_of_England.html" title="Edward IV of England">Edward IV</a>, impeachment fell into disuse, the <a href="/wiki/Bill_of_attainder.html" title="Bill of attainder">bill of attainder</a> becoming the preferred form of dealing with undesirable subjects of the Crown. However, during the reign of <a href="/wiki/James_I_of_England.html" title="James I of England">James I</a> and thereafter, impeachments became more popular, as they did not require the assent of the Crown, while bills of attainder did, thus allowing Parliament to resist royal attempts to dominate Parliament. The most recent cases of impeachment dealt with <a href="/wiki/Warren_Hastings.html" title="Warren Hastings">Warren Hastings</a>, Governor-General of India between 1773 and 1786 (impeached in 1788; the Lords found him not guilty in 1795), and <a href="/wiki/Henry_Dundas%2C_1st_Viscount_Melville.html" title="Henry Dundas, 1st Viscount Melville">Henry Dundas, 1st Viscount Melville</a>, <a href="/wiki/First_Lord_of_the_Admiralty.html" title="First Lord of the Admiralty">First Lord of the Admiralty</a>, in 1806 (acquitted). The last attempted impeachment occurred in <a href="/wiki/1848.html" title="1848">1848</a>, when <a href="/wiki/David_Urquhart.html" title="David Urquhart">David Urquhart</a> accused <a href="/wiki/Henry_Temple%2C_3rd_Viscount_Palmerston.html" title="Henry Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston">Lord Palmerston</a> of having signed a secret treaty with <a href="/wiki/Imperial_Russia.html" title="Imperial Russia">Imperial Russia</a> and of receiving monies from the <a href="/wiki/Nicholas_I_of_Russia.html" title="Nicholas I of Russia">Tsar</a>. Palmerston survived the vote in the Commons; the Lords did not hear the case.</p>

<h3>Impeachment in modern politics</h3>
<p>The procedure has, over time, become rarely used and some legal authorities (such as <a href="/wiki/Halsbury%27s_Laws_of_England.html" title="Halsbury's Laws of England">Halsbury's Laws of England</a>) consider it to be probably obsolete. The principles of "responsible government" require that the <a href="/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom.html" title="Prime Minister of the United Kingdom">Prime Minister</a> and other executive officers answer to Parliament, rather than to the Sovereign. Thus the Commons can remove such an officer without a long, drawn-out impeachment. However, it is argued by some that the remedy of impeachment remains as part of British constitutional law, and that legislation would be required to abolish it. Furthermore, impeachment as a means of punishment for wrongdoing, as distinct from being a means of removing a minister, remains a valid reason for accepting that it continues to be available, at least in theory.</p>
<p>In April 1977 the <a href="/wiki/Young_Liberals.html" title="Young Liberals">Young Liberals</a>' annual conference unanimously passed a motion to call on the <a href="/wiki/Liberal_Party_%28UK%29.html" title="Liberal Party (UK)">Liberal</a> leader (<a href="/wiki/David_Steel.html" title="David Steel">David Steel</a>) to move for the impeachment of <a href="/wiki/Ronald_King_Murray.html" title="Ronald King Murray">Ronald King Murray</a> QC, the <a href="/wiki/Lord_Advocate.html" title="Lord Advocate">Lord Advocate</a>. Mr. Steel did not call the motion but Murray (now Lord Murray, a former <a href="/wiki/List_of_Senators_of_the_College_of_Justice.html" title="List of Senators of the College of Justice">Senator of the College of Justice</a> of Scotland) agrees that the Commons still have the right to initiate an impeachment motion. On <a href="/wiki/August_25.html" title="August 25">25 August</a> <a href="/wiki/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>, <a href="/wiki/Plaid_Cymru.html" title="Plaid Cymru">Plaid Cymru</a> MP <a href="/wiki/Adam_Price.html" title="Adam Price">Adam Price</a> announced his <a href="/wiki/Impeach_Blair_campaign.html" title="Impeach Blair campaign">intention to move for the impeachment</a> of <a href="/wiki/Tony_Blair.html" title="Tony Blair">Tony Blair</a> for his role in involving Britain in the <a href="/wiki/2003_invasion_of_Iraq.html" title="2003 invasion of Iraq">2003 invasion of Iraq</a>. In response <a href="/wiki/Peter_Hain.html" title="Peter Hain">Peter Hain</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Leader_of_the_House_of_Commons.html" title="Leader of the House of Commons">Commons Leader</a>, insisted that impeachment was obsolete, given modern government's responsibility to parliament. Ironically, <a href="/wiki/Peter_Hain.html" title="Peter Hain">Peter Hain</a> had served as president of the Young Liberals when they called for the impeachment of Mr. Murray in 1977.</p>
<p>In 2006 <a href="/wiki/General.html" title="General">General</a> <a href="/wiki/Sir.html" title="Sir">Sir</a> <a href="/wiki/Hugh_Michael_Rose.html" title="Hugh Michael Rose">Michael Rose</a> revived the call for the impeachment of <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom.html" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> <a href="/wiki/Prime_Minister.html" title="Prime Minister">Prime Minister</a> <a href="/wiki/Tony_Blair.html" title="Tony Blair">Tony Blair</a> for leading the country into the <a href="/wiki/Invasion_of_Iraq.html" title="Invasion of Iraq">invasion of Iraq</a> in 2003 under false pretenses.

</div>
</div>
<p>In the <a href="/wiki/United_States.html" title="United States">United States</a>, impeachment can occur both at the federal and state level. At the federal level, different standards apply when the impeachment involves a member of the <a href="/wiki/Executive_branch.html" title="Executive branch">executive branch</a> or of the <a href="/wiki/Judiciary.html" title="Judiciary">judiciary</a> (and dispute currently exists over the use of impeachment against members of the legislative branch.) For the executive branch, only those who have allegedly committed "<a href="/wiki/Treason.html" title="Treason">treason</a>, <a href="/wiki/Bribery.html" title="Bribery">bribery</a>, or other high crimes and misdemeanors" may be impeached. Although treason and bribery are obvious, the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Constitution.html" title="United States Constitution">Constitution</a> is silent on what constitutes a "high crime or misdemeanor." Several commentators have suggested that <a href="/wiki/Congress.html" title="Congress">Congress</a> alone may decide for itself what constitutes an impeachable offense. The standard for impeachment among the judiciary is much broader. Article III of the Constitution states that judges remain in office "during good behavior," implying that Congress may remove a judge for bad behavior. The standard for impeachment of members of the legislature is/would be the same as the Executive standard, "treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors."</p>
<p>The central question regarding the Constitutional dispute about the impeachment of members of the legislature is this: Are members of Congress "officers" of the United States? The Constitution grants to the House the power to impeach "The President, the Vice President, and all civil Officers of the United States." Many believe firmly that Members of Congress are <i>not</i> "officers of the United States." <a  class="external text" title="http://www.continuityofgovernment.org/pdfs/091603MillerTestimony.pdf">Source (pdf) (Navigate to page 7)</a> Many others, however, believe that Members are civil Officers and are subjected to impeachment. The House of Representatives did impeach a Senator once, Senator <a href="/wiki/William_Blount.html" title="William Blount">William Blount</a>. The Senate expelled Senator Blount and, after initially hearing his impeachment, dismissed the charges for lack of jurisdiction. Left unsettled was the question "Are members of Congress civil officers of the United States?" In modern times, expulsion has become the preferred (albeit rare) method of dealing with errant Members of Congress, as each House has the authority to expel their own membersâwithout involving the other chamber, as impeachment would require.</p>
<p>The impeachment procedure is in two steps. The <a href="/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives.html" title="United States House of Representatives">House of Representatives</a> must first pass "articles of impeachment" by a simple majority. (All fifty state legislatures as well as the <a href="/wiki/District_of_Columbia.html" title="District of Columbia">District of Columbia</a> city council may also pass articles of impeachment against their own executives). The articles of impeachment constitute the formal allegations. Upon their passage, the defendant has been "impeached."</p>
<p>Next, the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Senate.html" title="United States Senate">Senate</a> tries the accused. In the case of the impeachment of a President, the <a href="/wiki/Chief_Justice_of_the_United_States.html" title="Chief Justice of the United States">Chief Justice of the United States</a> presides over the proceedings. Otherwise, the <a href="/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States.html" title="Vice President of the United States">Vice President</a>, in his capacity as President of the Senate, or the <a href="/wiki/President_Pro_Tempore_of_the_United_States_Senate.html" title="President Pro Tempore of the United States Senate">President <i>pro tempore</i> of the Senate</a> presides. This may include the impeachment of the Vice President him- or herself, although legal theories suggest that allowing a person to be the judge in the case where s/he was the defendant wouldn't be permitted. If the Vice President did not preside over an impeachment, the duties would fall to the <a href="/wiki/President_Pro_Tempore.html" title="President Pro Tempore">President Pro Tempore</a>.</p>
<p>In order to convict the accused, a <a href="/wiki/Two-thirds_majority.html" title="Two-thirds majority">two-thirds majority</a> of the senators present is required. Conviction automatically removes the defendant from office. Following conviction, the Senate may vote to further punish the individual by barring them from holding future federal office (either elected or appointed). Despite a conviction by the Senate, the defendant remains liable to criminal prosecution. It is possible to impeach someone even after the accused has vacated their office in order to disqualify the person from future office or from certain emoluments of their prior office (such as a pension.) If a <a href="/wiki/Two-thirds_majority.html" title="Two-thirds majority">two-thirds majority</a> of the senators present does not vote "Guilty" on one or more of the charges, the defendant is acquitted and no punishment is imposed.</p>
<p>Congress regards impeachment as a power to be used only in extreme cases; the House has initiated impeachment proceedings only 62 times since <a href="/wiki/1789.html" title="1789">1789</a> (most recently President Clinton), and only the following 17 federal officers have been impeached:</p>
<ul>
<li>two <a href="/wiki/President_of_the_United_States.html" title="President of the United States">presidents</a>:
<ul>
<li><a href="/wiki/Andrew_Johnson.html" title="Andrew Johnson">Andrew Johnson</a> was impeached in <a href="/wiki/1868.html" title="1868">1868</a> after violating the then-newly created <a href="/wiki/Tenure_of_Office_Act.html" title="Tenure of Office Act">Tenure of Office Act</a>.

<p>Many mistakenly assume <a href="/wiki/Richard_Nixon.html" title="Richard Nixon">Richard Nixon</a> was impeached, but he wasn't. While the House Judiciary Committee did approve articles of impeachment against him (by wide margins) and did report those articles to the full House, Nixon resigned prior to House consideration of the impeachment resolutions. Both his impeachment by the House of Representatives and his conviction by the Senate were near certainties; Nixon reportedly decided to resign after being told this by a Republican Senator.</p>
<p>Nixon's first vice president, <a href="/wiki/Spiro_Agnew.html" title="Spiro Agnew">Spiro Agnew</a>, also resigned rather than wait to be impeached for tax evasion and money laundering.</p>

<h2>Republic of Ireland</h2>
<p>In the <a href="/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland.html" title="Republic of Ireland">Republic of Ireland</a> formal impeachment can apply only to the <a href="/wiki/President_of_Ireland.html" title="President of Ireland">President</a>. Article 12 of the <a href="/wiki/Constitution_of_Ireland.html" title="Constitution of Ireland">Constitution of Ireland</a> provides that, unless judged to be "permanently incapacitated" by the <a href="/wiki/Irish_Supreme_Court.html" title="Irish Supreme Court">Supreme Court</a>, the president can only be removed from office by the houses of the <a href="/wiki/Oireachtas.html" title="Oireachtas">Oireachtas</a> (parliament) and only for the commission of "stated misbehaviour". Either house of the Oireachtas may impeach the president, but only by a resolution approved by a majority of at least two-thirds of its total number of members; and a house may not consider a proposal for impeachment unless requested to do so by at least thirty of its number.</p>
<p>Where one house impeaches the president, the remaining house either investigates the charge or commissions another body or committee to do so. The investigating house can remove the president if it decides, by at least a two-thirds majority of its members, both that she is guilty of the charge of which she stands accused, and that the charge is sufficiently serious as to warrant her removal. To date no impeachment of an Irish president has ever taken place. The president holds a largely ceremonial office, the dignity of which is considered important, so it is likely that a president would resign from office long before undergoing formal conviction or impeachment.</p>
<p>The Republic's constitution and law also provide that only a joint resolution of both houses of the Oireachtas may remove a judge. Although often referred to as the 'impeachment' of a judge, this procedure does not technically involve impeachment.</p>
