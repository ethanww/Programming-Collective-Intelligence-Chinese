<p>The <b>United States presidential election of 2000</b> was one of the closest Presidential elections in United States' history, with 537 votes separating the candidates in the <a href="/wiki/Swing_state.html" title="Swing state">swing state</a> of <a href="/wiki/Florida.html" title="Florida">Florida</a>. On election night, <a href="/wiki/November_7.html" title="November 7">November 7</a>, the media prematurely declared a winner twice based on exit polls before finally deciding that the Florida race was too close to call. It would turn out to be a month before the election was finally certified after numerous court challenges and recounts. <a href="/wiki/United_States_Republican_Party.html" title="United States Republican Party">Republican</a> candidate <a href="/wiki/George_W._Bush.html" title="George W. Bush">George W. Bush</a> won Florida's 25 electoral votes by a razor-thin margin of the popular vote in that state, and thereby defeated <a href="/wiki/United_States_Democratic_Party.html" title="United States Democratic Party">Democratic</a> candidate <a href="/wiki/Al_Gore.html" title="Al Gore">Al Gore</a>. As well as being extremely close, for a number of reasons the election was highly controversial.</p>
<p>This election marked the fourth time in <a href="/wiki/United_States.html" title="United States">United States</a> history, and the first time in over 100 years, that a candidate had won the Presidency while losing the nationwide popular vote. (The other times were the elections of <a href="/wiki/United_States_presidential_election%2C_1824.html" title="United States presidential election, 1824">1824</a>, <a href="/wiki/United_States_presidential_election%2C_1876.html" title="United States presidential election, 1876">1876</a>, and <a href="/wiki/United_States_presidential_election%2C_1888.html" title="United States presidential election, 1888">1888</a>.)</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/United_States_Supreme_Court.html" title="United States Supreme Court">United States Supreme Court</a> voted 7–2 to end the recount on the grounds that differing standards in different counties constituted an <a href="/wiki/Equal_Protection_Clause.html" title="Equal Protection Clause">equal protection</a> violation, and 5–4 that no new recount with uniform standards could be conducted. The 7-2 ruling was more important as the votes had already been counted several times with uniform standards. However, 5-4 decision became extremely controversial due to the partisan split in the court's 5–4 decision and the majority's irregular instruction that its judgment in <a href="/wiki/Bush_v._Gore.html" title="Bush v. Gore">Bush v. Gore</a> should not set precedent but should be "limited to the present circumstances". Gore publicly disagreed with the court's decision, but conceded the election "for the sake of our unity as a people and the strength of our democracy". He had previously made a concession phone call to Bush the night of the election, then retracted it after learning just how close the election was. Following the election, recounts conducted by various United States news media organizations indicated that Bush would have won if certain recounting methods had been used (including the one favored by Gore at the time of the Supreme Court decision) but that Gore would have won had a full state-wide recount been conducted <a  class="external text" title="http://www.amstat.org/misc/PresidentialElectionBallots.pdf">(The American Statistitian, February 2003, Vol. 57, No.1)</a>.</p>

<p>The Florida election has been closely scrutinized since the election, and several irregularities are thought to have favored Bush. These included the notorious <a href="/wiki/Palm_Beach_County%2C_Florida.html" title="Palm Beach County, Florida">Palm Beach</a> "butterfly ballot", which produced an unexpectedly large number of votes for third-party candidate Patrick Buchanan, and a purge of some 50,000 alleged felons from the Florida voting rolls that included many voters who were eligible to vote under Florida law. Some commentators still consider such irregularities and the legal maneuvering around the recounts to cast doubt on the legitimacy of the vote, but as a matter of law the issue was settled when the <a href="/wiki/Congress_of_the_United_States.html" title="Congress of the United States">United States Congress</a> accepted Florida's electoral delegation. Nonetheless, embarrassment about the Florida vote uncertainties led to widespread calls for electoral reform in the United States and ultimately to the passage of the <a href="/wiki/Help_America_Vote_Act.html" title="Help America Vote Act">Help America Vote Act</a>, which authorized the <a href="/wiki/United_States_federal_government.html" title="United States federal government">United States federal government</a> to provide funds to the states to replace their mechanical voting equipment with <a href="/wiki/Electronic_voting.html" title="Electronic voting">electronic voting</a> equipment. However, this has led to new controversies including the lack of paper-based methods of verification and the complexity of testing required to certify correct operation of computer-based systems.</p>

<p>Under the provisions of the <a href="/wiki/Twenty-second_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution.html" title="Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution">22nd amendment</a>, incumbent <a href="/wiki/President_of_the_United_States.html" title="President of the United States">President</a> <a href="/wiki/Bill_Clinton.html" title="Bill Clinton">Bill Clinton</a> was not allowed to run for a third term. Numerous candidates for the Democratic nomination tested the waters, but only two entered the contest, Vice President Al Gore of Tennessee and former Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey.</p>
<p>Gore had a strong base as the incumbent Vice President; Bradley received some endorsements but was not the candidate of a major faction or coalition of blocs. Running an insurgency campaign, Bradley positioned himself as the alternative to Gore, who was a founding member of the <a href="/wiki/Centrism.html" title="Centrism">centrist</a> <a href="/wiki/Democratic_Leadership_Council.html" title="Democratic Leadership Council">Democratic Leadership Council</a>. While fellow basketball star <a href="/wiki/Michael_Jordan.html" title="Michael Jordan">Michael Jordan</a> campaigned for him in the early primary states, Bradley announced his intention to campaign "in a different way" by conducting a positive campaign of "big ideas." He made the spending of the record-breaking <a href="/wiki/Budget_surplus.html" title="Budget surplus">budget surplus</a> on a variety of <a href="/wiki/Social_welfare.html" title="Social welfare">social welfare</a> programs to help the poor and the middle-class one of his central issues, along with <a href="/wiki/Campaign_finance_reform.html" title="Campaign finance reform">campaign finance reform</a> and <a href="/wiki/Gun_control.html" title="Gun control">gun control</a>.</p>
<p>Bradley was easily defeated by Gore in the primaries, due in large part to the support given to Gore by the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Democratic_Party.html" title="United States Democratic Party">Democratic Party</a> establishment and Bradley's poor showing in the <a href="/wiki/Iowa_caucus.html" title="Iowa caucus">Iowa caucus</a>, where Gore successfully painted the aloof Bradley as being indifferent to the plight of the farmers in rural America. The closest Bradley came to a victory was his 50–46 loss to Gore in the <a href="/wiki/New_Hampshire_primary.html" title="New Hampshire primary">New Hampshire primary</a>.</p>
<p>None of Bradley's delegates were allowed to vote for him so Gore won unanimously. <a href="/wiki/Connecticut.html" title="Connecticut">Connecticut</a> Senator <a href="/wiki/Joe_Lieberman.html" title="Joe Lieberman">Joe Lieberman</a> was nominated for Vice President by voice vote.</p>

<p>Following <a href="/wiki/Bob_Dole.html" title="Bob Dole">Bob Dole's</a> loss to Bill Clinton in the <a href="/wiki/United_States_presidential_election%2C_1996.html" title="United States presidential election, 1996">1996 election</a>, George W. Bush became the frontrunner, acquiring unprecedented funding and a broad base of leadership support. Several aspirants withdrew before the Iowa Caucus, unable to secure funding and endorsements sufficient to remain competitive with Bush. These included Alexander, Dole, Kasich, and Quayle. Steve Forbes, who could self-finance, did compete in the early contests, but did not do as well as he had in 1996. That left Bush, McCain, and Keyes as the only candidates still in the race.</p>
<p>Bush, the governor of the second-largest state in the Union, the son of a former president, and the favored candidate of the <a href="/wiki/Christian_right.html" title="Christian right">Christian right</a>, was portrayed in the media as the establishment candidate. McCain, with the support of many moderate Republicans and Independents, portrayed himself as a crusading insurgent who focused on campaign reform.</p>
<p>McCain won a startling 60-40 victory in the <a href="/wiki/New_Hampshire_primary.html" title="New Hampshire primary">New Hampshire primary</a> and seized the attention of the media. In the <a href="/wiki/South_Carolina.html" title="South Carolina">South Carolina</a> primary, however, Bush soundly defeated McCain. Some credited Bush's win to the fact that it was the first major primary in which only registered Republicans could vote, which negated McCain's strong advantage among independents. Some McCain supporters blamed it on a campaign of <a href="/wiki/Dirty_tricks.html" title="Dirty tricks">dirty tricks</a> such as <a href="/wiki/Push_polling.html" title="Push polling">push polling</a>, including the false suggestion that McCain fathered an African-American child out of wedlock, perpetrated against McCain by his political enemies. Whatever the real reason, McCain's loss in South Carolina stopped his momentum cold. Although McCain won a few additional primaries, Bush took the majority and, with the support of the party's <a href="/wiki/Superdelegate.html" title="Superdelegate">superdelegates</a>, handily won the nomination at the <a href="/wiki/Republican_National_Convention.html" title="Republican National Convention">Republican National Convention</a> in <a href="/wiki/Philadelphia.html" title="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a>.</p>
<p>The tally was as follows:</p>

<p>McCain finally endorsed Bush, and gave a strong speech at the convention, meanwhile...</p>
<p>Governor Bush asked former <a href="/wiki/Secretary_of_Defense.html" title="Secretary of Defense">Secretary of Defense</a> <a href="/wiki/Dick_Cheney.html" title="Dick Cheney">Dick Cheney</a> to head up a commission to help select a running mate for him.

<h3>Campaign</h3>
<p>In the campaign, Bush criticized the Clinton administration policy in <a href="/wiki/Somalia.html" title="Somalia">Somalia</a>, where 18 Americans died in <a href="/wiki/1993.html" title="1993">1993</a> trying to sort out warring factions, and in the Balkans, where United States peacekeeping troops perform a variety of functions. "I don't think our troops ought to be used for what's called <a href="/wiki/Nation-building.html" title="Nation-building">nation-building</a>". Bush said in the second <a href="/wiki/American_presidential_debate.html" title="American presidential debate">presidential debate</a>.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a  title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Nader was the most successful of third-party candidates, drawing 2.74% of the popular vote. His campaign was marked by a traveling tour of "super-rallies"; large rallies held in sports arenas like <a href="/wiki/Madison_Square_Garden.html" title="Madison Square Garden">Madison Square Garden</a>, with filmmaker <a href="/wiki/Michael_Moore.html" title="Michael Moore">Michael Moore</a> as master of ceremonies. After initially ignoring Nader, the Gore campaign made a big publicity pitch to (potential) Nader supporters in the final weeks of the campaign, downplaying Gore's differences with Nader on the issues and claiming that Gore's ideas were more similar to Nader's than Bush's were, noting that Gore had a better chance of winning than Nader. On the other side, the <a  class="new" title="Republican Leadership Council">Republican Leadership Council</a> ran pro-Nader ads in a few states in an effort to split the "left" vote.<a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/aponline/20001027/aponline115918_000.htm">[1]</a> In the aftermath of the campaign, many Gore supporters blamed Nader for drawing enough would-be Gore votes to push Bush over Gore, labeling Nader a <a href="/wiki/Spoiler_effect.html" title="Spoiler effect">"spoiler" candidate</a>.</p>

<h4>Issues</h4>
<p>The sharpest differences among partisan groups came on the topic of morality. Already by 1992, Republicans were much more concerned than Democrats or independents about the alleged moral decay of society, in the form of permissive attitudes toward sex, abortion, gays and lesbians, and secularism. The difference grew larger by 2000, especially if one adds together the moral decay category and the category having to do with corruption and scandals in Washington. Morality was mentioned most frequently by Republicans as the "single most important problem" facing the nation.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a  title="">[2]</a></sup> Therefore during his campaign Bush frequently referred to restoring moral integrity not only to the White House but to the nation as a whole. Gore on the other hand studiously avoided the Clinton scandals, as did Lieberman, even though Lieberman had been the first Democratic senator to denounce Clinton's misbehavior. Gore avoided appearing with Clinton, who was shunted to low visibility appearances in minority areas.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Disputes">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Disputes" id="Disputes"></a></p>
<h3>Disputes</h3>
<p>The outcome of the <a href="/wiki/November_7.html" title="November 7">November 7</a> election was not known for more than a month after the balloting, because of the extended process of counting and then recounting of Florida presidential ballots, which would ultimately decide the election. State results tallied on election night gave 246 electoral votes to Bush and 255 to Gore, with <a href="/wiki/New_Mexico.html" title="New Mexico">New Mexico</a> (5), <a href="/wiki/Oregon.html" title="Oregon">Oregon</a> (7), and <a href="/wiki/Florida.html" title="Florida">Florida</a> (25) too close to call at the time. Since 270 electoral votes are required to win, Florida would put either candidate over the top, and the other two states were irrelevant. (Both New Mexico and Oregon were declared in favor of Gore over the next few days, making it 246–267.)</p>
<p>Bush won the election night vote count in Florida by a little over 1000 votes. Florida state law provided for an automatic recount due to the small margins. There were general concerns about the fairness and accuracy of the voting process, especially since a small change in the vote count could change the result. The final (and disputed) official Florida count gave the victory to Bush by 537 votes, making it the tightest race of the campaign (at least in percentage terms; New Mexico was decided by 363 votes but has a much smaller population, meaning those 363 votes represent a 0.061% difference while the 537 votes in Florida are just 0.009%).</p>
<p>Once the closeness of the election in Florida was clear, both the Bush and Gore campaigns organized themselves for the ensuing legal process. The Bush campaign hired <a href="/wiki/George_H._W._Bush.html" title="George H. W. Bush">George H. W. Bush</a>'s former <a href="/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_State.html" title="United States Secretary of State">Secretary of State</a> <a href="/wiki/James_Baker.html" title="James Baker">James Baker</a> to oversee their legal team, and the Gore campaign hired <a href="/wiki/Bill_Clinton.html" title="Bill Clinton">Bill Clinton</a>'s former Secretary of State <a href="/wiki/Warren_Christopher.html" title="Warren Christopher">Warren Christopher</a>.</p>
<p>The Gore campaign, as allowed by Florida statute, requested that disputed ballots in four counties be counted by hand. Florida statutes also required that all counties certify and report their returns, including any recounts, by 5 p.m. on <a href="/wiki/November_14.html" title="November 14">November 14</a>. The manual recounts were time consuming, and, when it became clear that some counties would not complete their recounts before the deadline, both Volusia and Palm Beach Counties sued to have their deadlines extended. The Bush campaign, in response to state litigation in the case of <i>Palm Beach Canvassing Board v. Katherine Harris</i>, filed suit in federal court against extending the statutory deadlines for the manual recounts. Besides deadlines, also in dispute were the criteria that each county canvassing board would use in examining the overvotes and/or undervotes. Numerous local court rulings went both ways, some ordering recounts because the vote was so close and others declaring that a selective manual recount in a few heavily-Democratic counties would be unfair. Eventually, the Gore campaign appealed to the Florida Supreme Court which ordered the recounting process to proceed. The Bush campaign subsequently appealed to the <a href="/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States.html" title="Supreme Court of the United States">Supreme Court of the United States</a> (SCOTUS) which took up the case <i>Bush v. Palm Beach County Canvassing Board</i> on <a href="/wiki/December_1.html" title="December 1">December 1</a>. On <a href="/wiki/December_4.html" title="December 4">December 4</a>, the SCOTUS returned this matter to the Florida Supreme Court for clarification due to their "considerable uncertainty" as to the reasons for certain aspects of the decision. The Florida Supreme Court clarified its ruling on this matter while the United States Supreme Court was deliberating <i><a href="/wiki/Bush_v._Gore.html" title="Bush v. Gore">Bush v. Gore</a></i>.</p>
<p>At 4:00 p.m. <a href="/wiki/Eastern_Standard_Time_Zone.html" title="Eastern Standard Time Zone">EST</a> on <a href="/wiki/December_8.html" title="December 8">December 8</a>, the Florida Supreme Court, by a 4 to 3 vote, ordered a manual recount, under the supervision of the Leon County Circuit Court, of disputed ballots in all Florida counties and the portion of Miami-Dade county in which such a recount was not already complete. That decision was announced on live world-wide television by the Florida Supreme Court's spokesman <a href="/wiki/Craig_Waters.html" title="Craig Waters">Craig Waters</a>, the Court's <a href="/wiki/Public_information_officer.html" title="Public information officer">public information officer</a>. The Court further ordered that only undervotes be considered. The results of this tally were to be added to the November 14 tally. This count was in progress on <a href="/wiki/December_9.html" title="December 9">December 9</a>, when the United States Supreme Court 5-4 (Justices Stevens, Souter, Ginsburg and Breyer dissenting) granted Bush's emergency plea for a stay of the Florida Supreme Court recount ruling, stopping the incomplete recount.</p>
<p>Early in the afternoon of <a href="/wiki/December_12.html" title="December 12">December 12</a>, the Republican-dominated Florida House of Representatives voted nearly on party lines to certify the state's electors for Bush. Later that afternoon, the Florida Supreme Court upheld lower court rulings authorizing recounts in several south Florida counties.</p>
<p>About 10 p.m. EST on <a href="/wiki/December_12.html" title="December 12">December 12</a>, the United States Supreme Court handed down its ruling in favor of Bush by a 5–4 vote, effectively ending the legal review of the vote count with Bush in the lead. Seven of the nine justices cited differing vote-counting standards from county to county and the lack of a single judicial officer to oversee the recount, both of which, they ruled, violated the <a href="/wiki/Equal_Protection_Clause.html" title="Equal Protection Clause">Equal Protection Clause</a> of the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Constitution.html" title="United States Constitution">United States Constitution</a>.</p>
<p>The crucial 5 to 4 decision held that insufficient time remained to implement a unified standard and therefore all recounts must stop.</p>
<p>At 9pm on <a href="/wiki/December_13.html" title="December 13">December 13</a>, in a nationally televised address, Gore conceded that he had lost his bid for the presidency. He asked his supporters to support Bush, saying, "This is America, and we put country before party." During his speech, Gore's family, running mate Joe Lieberman, and Lieberman's wife Hadassah stood nearby.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Texas.html" title="Texas">Texas</a> Governor <a href="/wiki/George_W._Bush.html" title="George W. Bush">George W. Bush</a> became President-elect and began forming his transition committee.

<p>On <a href="/wiki/January_6.html" title="January 6">January 6</a>, <a href="/wiki/2001.html" title="2001">2001</a>, a joint session of <a href="/wiki/Congress_of_the_United_States.html" title="Congress of the United States">Congress</a> met to certify the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Electoral_College.html" title="United States Electoral College">electoral vote</a>. Twenty members of the <a href="/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives.html" title="United States House of Representatives">House of Representatives</a>, most of them Democratic members of the <a href="/wiki/Congressional_Black_Caucus.html" title="Congressional Black Caucus">Congressional Black Caucus</a>, rose one by one to file objections to the electoral votes of Florida. However, according to an <a href="/wiki/1877.html" title="1877">1877</a> law, any such objection had to be sponsored by both a representative and a <a href="/wiki/United_States_Senate.html" title="United States Senate">senator</a>, and no senator would co-sponsor these objections. Therefore, Gore, who was presiding in his capacity as <a href="/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States.html" title="Vice President of the United States">President of the Senate</a>, ruled each of these objections out of order.</p>
<p>Bush took the oath of office on <a href="/wiki/January_20.html" title="January 20">January 20</a>, <a href="/wiki/2001.html" title="2001">2001</a>.</p>

(Due to the unusual ballot in Alabama in <a href="/wiki/United_States_presidential_election%2C_1960.html" title="United States presidential election, 1960">1960</a>, it is unclear how much of the popular vote in that state can be attributed to Kennedy and hence whether Kennedy beat Nixon in the popular vote.)</p>

<h2>Florida election results</h2>
<p>On election night, it quickly became clear that Florida would be a contentious state. The national television networks, through information provided them by the <a href="/wiki/Voter_News_Service.html" title="Voter News Service">Voter News Service</a>, first called Florida for Gore in the hour after polls closed in the eastern peninsula but before they closed in the heavily Republican counties of the <a href="/wiki/Florida_panhandle.html" title="Florida panhandle">western panhandle</a>. (The peninsula is on <a href="/wiki/North_American_Eastern_Standard_Time_Zone.html" title="North American Eastern Standard Time Zone">Eastern Time</a> and the panhandle is on <a href="/wiki/Central_Standard_Time_Zone.html" title="Central Standard Time Zone">Central Time</a>.) After the polls had closed in the panhandle, the networks retracted their call for Gore, calling the state for Bush; then retracted that call as well, finally indicating the state "too close to call". The Voter News Service was an organization backed and supported by television networks and the <a href="/wiki/Associated_Press.html" title="Associated Press">Associated Press</a> to help determine the results of presidential elections as early as possible, through early result tallies and exit polling.</p>
<p>Due to the narrow margin of the original vote count, Florida law mandated a <a href="/wiki/Florida_Recount.html" title="Florida Recount">statewide recount</a>. In addition, the Gore campaign requested that the votes in three counties be recounted by hand. Florida state law (F.S. Ch. 102.166) at the time allowed the candidate to request a manual recount by protesting the results of at least three precincts. The county canvassing board then decides whether or not to recount (F.S. Ch. 102.166 Part 4) as well as the method of the recount in those three precincts. If the board discovers an error, they are then authorized to recount the ballots (F.S. Ch. 102.166 Part 5). The canvassing board did not discover any errors in the tabulation process in the initial mandated recount. The Bush campaign sued to prevent additional recounts on the basis that no errors were found in the tabulation method until <a href="/wiki/Chad_%28paper%29.html" title="Chad (paper)">subjective measures</a> were applied in manual recounts. This case eventually reached the United States Supreme Court, which ruled 5–4 to stop the vote recount, which allowed Florida Secretary of State <a href="/wiki/Katherine_Harris.html" title="Katherine Harris">Katherine Harris</a> to certify the election results. This allowed Florida's electoral votes to be cast for Bush, making him the winner. Seven of the nine Justices agreed that the lack of unified standards in counting votes violated the <a href="/wiki/Equal_Protection_Amendment.html" title="Equal Protection Amendment">Constitutional guarantee of equal protection</a>, but five agreed that there was insufficient time to impose a unified standard and that the recounts should therefore be stopped.</p>

<h3>Controversy in Florida</h3>
<p>Following the election a number of studies have been made of the electoral process in Florida by Democrats, Republicans, and other interested parties. A number of flaws and improprieties have been discovered in the process. Controversies included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Numerous media outlets made the incorrect assumption that all of Florida's polls closed at 7:00 PM EST, which was not the case. Westernmost counties in Florida had polls open until 8:00 PM EST, as they were part of the Central Time Zone, so were open for one additional hour. This region of the state traditionally voted mostly Republican. Because of the above mistaken assumption, some media outlets reported at 7:00 PM EST that all polls had closed in the state of Florida. Also, significantly, the <a href="/wiki/Voter_News_Service.html" title="Voter News Service">Voter News Service</a> called the state of Florida for Al Gore at 7:48 PM EST. A survey estimate by <a  class="external text" title="http://www.mclaughlinonline.com/newspoll/np2001/001206panh.htm">John McLaughlin &amp; Associates</a> put the number of voters who did not vote due to confusion as high as 15,000, which theoretically reduced Bush's margin of victory by an estimated 5,000 votes. This survey assumes that the turnout in the Panhandle counties (which was 65% of the electorate) would have equalled the statewide average of 68% if the media had not incorrectly reported the polls' closing time and if the state had not been called for Gore while the polls were still open. This opens the possibility that Bush would have won by a larger victory margin and controversy would have been avoided if the networks had known and reported the correct poll closing times, and called the state after all polls were closed. At the urging of the Republican party, some individuals made public statements to the effect that they would have voted for Bush, but did not vote because of the poll close time confusion, or the Gore call. However, there is no known corroborative evidence of any <i>widespread</i> or <i>localized</i> disenfranchisement beyond these individual statements. It is worth noting that both parties had extensive field operations on the ground throughout Florida, including in the Panhandle. Both field operations heavily publicized the correct polling hours; and local government and media also would have publicized the poll-closing times before the election. Moreover, the polling hours in 2000 were the same as they had been in previous elections. These factors presumably to some extent mitigated the damage done by the erroneous reports on election night.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><a href="/wiki/Jeb_Bush.html" title="Jeb Bush">Jeb Bush</a>, the brother of George W. Bush, was governor of Florida, leading some Gore advocates to make various allegations of impropriety, especially due to their joint campaigning for the Republican vote in Florida and Jeb Bush's assurances to George W. Bush that the Republicans could win Florida. While it is typical for sitting governors to strongly campaign on behalf of the candidate with the same party affiliation, it is unusual for the governor to be related by blood to the candidate and in a position to influence the election in his favor. Some democracy advocates have taken offense at his request for the removal of Florida election officials explaining voting/recount law on TV.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>State senator Daryll Jones claimed that on the day of the election there had been an order to set up road blocks. These road blocks were set disproportionately in democratic regions of the state. <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/1102806.stm">[3]</a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The actions of the Florida Secretary of State, <a href="/wiki/Katherine_Harris.html" title="Katherine Harris">Katherine Harris</a>, who was in charge of state election procedures, also came under fire, due to her status as a Bush state campaign co-chairwoman, her involvement with the "<a href="/wiki/Florida_Central_Voter_File.html" title="Florida Central Voter File">scrub list</a>", and her behavior during the recount crisis. In particular democracy advocates have taken issue with her antagonizing of Democratic lawyers, dispatching of a lawyer to Palm Beach county to convince the voting board of voting down a manual recount (despite thousands of protesters within the county including 12,000 with affidavits), and in particular her collaboration with Republican party advisers (at one point housing them).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>There were a number of overseas ballots missing <a href="/wiki/Postmark.html" title="Postmark">postmarks</a> or filled out in such a way that they were invalid under Florida law. A poll worker filled out the missing information on some absentee ballot applications; the Democrats moved to have the returned ballots thrown out because of this. These disputes added to the mass of litigation between parties to influence the counting of ballots. The largest group of disputed overseas ballots were military ballots, which the Republicans argued to have accepted.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Some 179,855 ballots were not counted in the official tally. These were ballots which were mistakenly filled out, however, in some counties the <a href="/wiki/Voting_machine.html" title="Voting machine">voting machines</a> (<a  class="new" title="Accuvote">Accuvotes</a>) would return the ballot and allow voters to try again, whereas in other <a href="/wiki/County.html" title="County">counties</a> the reject mechanisms were not enabled, thus giving voters only one chance to mark the ballot correctly.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>A suit by <a href="/wiki/National_Association_for_the_Advancement_of_Colored_People.html" title="National Association for the Advancement of Colored People">NAACP</a> (NAACP v. Harris) argued that Florida was in violation of the <a href="/wiki/Voting_Rights_Act_of_1965.html" title="Voting Rights Act of 1965">Voting Rights Act of 1965</a> and the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Constitution.html" title="United States Constitution">United States Constitution's</a> <a href="/wiki/Equal_Protection_Amendment.html" title="Equal Protection Amendment">Equal Protection Amendment</a>. Settlement agreements were reached in this suit. <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.choicepoint.net/85256B350053E646/0/16440966B650DEA685256BEB00461242?Open">[4]</a> However, a systematic investigation by the Civil Rights Division of the United States Department of Justice found no evidence of racial discrimination <a  class="external text" title="http://www.gwu.edu/~action/dojfl060702.html">Letter to Congress</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Between May 1999 and Election Day 2000, two Florida secretaries of state - <a  class="new" title="Sandra Mortham">Sandra Mortham</a> and <a href="/wiki/Katherine_Harris.html" title="Katherine Harris">Katherine Harris</a>, contracted with a new company (DBT), at an increase of $4.294 million dollars to have the "<a href="/wiki/Florida_Central_Voter_File.html" title="Florida Central Voter File">scrub list</a>"'s re-worked. Nearly 1 percent of Florida's electorate and nearly 3 percent of its African-American voters - 96.000 citizens were listed as felons and removed from the voting rolls. (For instance, many had names similar to actual felons, some erroneously listed "felonies" were dated years in the future.<a  class="external autonumber" title="http://gregpalast.com/detail.cfm?artid=122">[5]</a>, and some apparently were random.) In some cases, those on the scrub list were given several months to appeal, and many successfully reregistered and were allowed to vote. However, in most cases no effort was made to contact them before the election. The company was directed not to use cross-checks or its sophisticated verification plan (used by the FBI). <sup title="The text in the vicinity of this tag needs citation." class="noprint">[<a  title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><i>citation&#160;needed</i></a>]</sup></li>

It was his decision to call Florida for Bush, with Fox being the first network to do so. However, Fox had also incorrectly called the state for Gore before the polls had closed, like the other networks, and retracted around the same time they did which was at around 10pm that evening. Fox only called the state for Bush at 2:16am, shortly after the famous <a href="/wiki/Volusia_error.html" title="Volusia error">Volusia error</a> was introduced. This error took 16,022 votes away from Gore and added those votes and more to Bush, producing more total votes in the precinct than there were registered voters.

Suarez helped fill out absentee ballot forms and enlist Republican absentee voters in Miami-Dade County for the 2000 presidential election. “Dade County Republicans have a very specific expertise in getting out absentee ballots,” Suarez is claimed to have remarked. “I obviously have specific experience in this myself.” <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.campaignwatch.org/semdtl.htm">[6]</a></li>

The "butterfly ballot", as seen at an extreme angle.<sup>1</sup></div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The result of the Florida United States Presidential race was so close that one Florida county's hard-to-use ballot may have decided the presidency. Critics argue that some voters in <a href="/wiki/Palm_Beach_County%2C_Florida.html" title="Palm Beach County, Florida">Palm Beach County</a> might have accidentally voted for Reform Party candidate Pat Buchanan, when they thought they were voting for Al Gore, on a so-called "butterfly ballot". The Democrats are listed second in the left-hand column; but punching a hole in the second circle actually cast a vote for Buchanan, first listing in the right-hand column. Voters who punched this second hole would have ignored a prominent arrow on the ballot showing which hole was to be punched, because the design of the ballot neglected the effects of <a href="/wiki/Parallax.html" title="Parallax">parallax</a> due to the center row of holes being in a different plane from the two columns of printed names, and the ballot being viewed at an oblique angle.<a  class="external autonumber" title="http://jerz.setonhill.edu/design/usability/use-ballot.htm">[8]</a>. Since this is actually quite a shallow angle, the parallax effect would not have been as severe as compared with the image on the right.</p>
<p>The Palm Beach Post's review of the discarded ballots showed that 5,330 votes were cast for the presumably rare cross-party combination of Gore and Buchanan, compared with only 1,631 for the equivalent cross-party combination of Bush and Buchanan. In response, others point out that the ballot was designed by a Democrat, <a href="/wiki/Theresa_LePore.html" title="Theresa LePore">Theresa LePore</a> (who stated that she was basically unaffiliated and registered as a Democrat only because the county had historically chosen Democrats for her position), and approved by representatives of both major parties. But neither of these responses go to the issue of whether the ballot may have inadvertently cost Gore the election.</p>

Asked how many votes he would guess Buchanan legitimately received in Palm Beach County, he said, "I think 1,000 would be generous. Do I believe that these people inadvertently cast their votes for Pat Buchanan? Yes, I do. We have to believe that based on the vote totals elsewhere."</p>

<h4>Electronic voting</h4>
<p>Since the Presidential Election was so close and hotly contested in Florida, the United States Government and state governments pushed for <a href="/wiki/Election_reform.html" title="Election reform">election reform</a> to be prepared by the <a href="/wiki/United_States_presidential_election%2C_2004.html" title="United States presidential election, 2004">2004 United States Presidential Election</a>. Many of Florida's year 2000 election night problems stemmed from voting machine issues like rejected ballots, "<a href="/wiki/Hanging_chad.html" title="Hanging chad">hanging chad</a>", and the possibly confusing "butterfly ballot". An opportunistic solution to these problems was assumed to be the installation of modern <a href="/wiki/Electronic_voting.html" title="Electronic voting">electronic voting</a> machines.</p>
<p>Electronic voting was initially touted by many as a <a href="/wiki/Universal_panacea.html" title="Universal panacea">panacea</a> for the ills faced during the 2000 election. In years following, such machines were questioned for a suspicious lack of a paper trail, less than ideal security standards, low tolerance for software or hardware problems, and being manufactured by companies which had openly supported Republican candidates. The United States Presidential Election of 2000 spurred the debate about election and voting reform, but it did not end it. <i>See <a href="/wiki/Electronic_voting#Problems_with_electronic_voting.html" title="Electronic voting">Electronic voting: problems</a>.</i></p>

<h4>Exit polling and declaration of vote winners</h4>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Voter_News_Service.html" title="Voter News Service">Voter News Service</a>'s reputation was badly tarnished by its treatment of Florida's presidential vote in 2000. Calling the state as a win for Gore 12 minutes before polls closed in the far western part of the state broke its own guidelines. More seriously, inconsistent polling results caused the VNS to change its call twice, first from Gore to Bush, and then to "too close to call". An attempt by VNS to use computer tallying during the 2002 congressional election was a failure, and the VNS disbanded.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Media post-electoral studies/recounts">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Media_post-electoral_studies.2Frecounts" id="Media_post-electoral_studies.2Frecounts"></a></p>
<h2>Media post-electoral studies/recounts</h2>
<p>After the election, <i><a href="/wiki/USA_Today.html" title="USA Today">USA Today</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/The_Miami_Herald.html" title="The Miami Herald">The Miami Herald</a></i>, and <a href="/wiki/Knight_Ridder.html" title="Knight Ridder">Knight Ridder</a> commissioned accounting firm <a  class="new" title="BDO Seidman">BDO Seidman</a> to count undervotes, that is, ballots which did not register any vote when counted by machine. BDO Seidman's results, reported in USA Today <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2001-04-03-floridamain.htm">[10]</a>, show that under the strictest standard, where only a cleanly punched ballot with a fully removed chad was counted, Gore won by three votes. Under all other standards, Bush won, with Bush's margin increasing as looser standards were used. The standards considered by BDO Seidman were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lenient standard. Any alteration in a chad, ranging from a dimple to a full punch, counts as a vote. By this standard, Bush won by 1,665 votes.</li>
<li>Palm Beach standard. A dimple is counted as a vote if other races on the same ballot show dimples as well. By this standard, Bush won by 884 votes.</li>
<li>Two-corner standard. A chad with two or more corners removed is counted as a vote. This is the most common standard in use. By this standard, Bush won by 363 votes.</li>
<li>Strict standard. Only a fully removed chad counts as a vote. By this standard, Gore won by 3 votes.</li>
</ul>
<p>The study remarks that because of the possibility of mistakes, it is difficult to conclude that Gore was surely the winner under the strict standard. It also remarks that there are variations between examiners, and that election officials often did not provide the same number of undervotes as were counted on Election Day. Furthermore, the study did not consider overvotes, ballots which registered more than one vote when counted by machine.</p>
<p>The study also found that undervotes break down into two distinct types, those coming from punch-card using counties, and those coming from optical-scan using counties. Undervotes from punch-card using counties give new votes to candidates in roughly the same proportion as the county's official vote. Furthermore, the number of undervotes correlates with how well the punch-card machines are maintained, and not with factors such as race or socioeconomic status. Undervotes from optical-scan using counties, however, correlate with Democratic votes more than Republican votes. Optical-scan counties were the only places in the study where Gore gained more votes than Bush, 1,036 to 775.</p>
<p>A larger consortium of news organizations, including the USA Today, the Miami Herald, Knight Ridder, the <a href="/wiki/Tampa_Tribune.html" title="Tampa Tribune">Tampa Tribune</a>, and five other newspapers next conducted a full recount of all ballots, including both undervotes and overvotes. According to their results, under stricter standards for vote counting, Bush won, and under looser standards, Gore won. <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2001-05-10-recountmain.htm">[11]</a> However, a Gore win was impossible without a recount of overvotes, which he did not request.</p>
<p>According to the study, only 3% of the 111,261 overvotes had markings that could be interpreted as a legal vote. According to Anthony Salvado, a political scientist at the <a href="/wiki/University_of_California%2C_Irvine.html" title="University of California, Irvine">University of California, Irvine</a>, who acted as a consultant on the media recount, most of the errors were caused by ballot design, ballot wording, and efforts by voters to choose both a president and a vice-president. For example, 21,188 of the Florida overvotes, or nearly one-fifth of the total, originated from Duval County, where the presidential race was split across two pages. Voters were instructed to "vote every page". Half of the overvotes in Duval County had one presidential candidate marked on each page, making their vote illegal under Florida law. Salvado says that this error alone cost Gore the election.</p>
<p>Including overvotes in the above totals for undervotes gives different margins of victory:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lenient standard. Gore by 332 votes.</li>
<li>Palm Beach standard. Gore by 242 votes.</li>
<li>Two-corner standard. Bush by 407 votes.</li>
<li>Strict standard. Bush by 152 votes.</li>

<h2>Consequences</h2>
<p>In the aftermath of the election, the <a href="/wiki/Help_America_Vote_Act.html" title="Help America Vote Act">Help America Vote Act</a> (HAVA) was passed to help states upgrade their election technology in the hopes of preventing similar problems in future elections. Ironically, the electronic voting systems which many states purchased in order to comply with HAVA actually caused problems in the following presidential election of 2004.</p>
<p>Democrats blamed third party candidate <a href="/wiki/Ralph_Nader.html" title="Ralph Nader">Ralph Nader</a> for taking the election away from Gore. Nader received some 97,000 votes in Florida. According to the Washington Post, exit polls there showed that "47 percent of Nader voters would have gone for Gore if it had been a two-man race, and only 21 percent for Bush," which would have given Gore a margin of some 24,000 votes over Bush.<a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A45950-2000Nov8?language=">[12]</a> Some Democrats claim that had Nader not run, Gore would have won both <a href="/wiki/New_Hampshire.html" title="New Hampshire">New Hampshire</a> and <a href="/wiki/Florida.html" title="Florida">Florida</a> and won the election with 296 electoral votes. (He only needed one of the two to win.) Nader's reputation was hurt by this perception, and may have hindered his future goals as an activist. Defenders of Nader, including <a href="/wiki/Tom_Tomorrow.html" title="Tom Tomorrow">Dan Perkins</a>, noted that the margin in Florida was small enough that Democrats could blame any number of third-party candidates for the defeat, including a "Workers' World Party," which received 1,500 votes. <sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a  title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
