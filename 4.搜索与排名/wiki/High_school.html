<p>High school is a term used for secondary schools in Australia. In <a href="/wiki/Victoria_%28Australia%29.html" title="Victoria (Australia)">Victoria</a> the name was officially changed to <a href="/wiki/Secondary_college.html" title="Secondary college">secondary college</a> in the early <a href="/wiki/1990s.html" title="1990s">1990s</a>, however some of the adult population refer to the period as "high school". In the <a href="/wiki/Australian_Capital_Territory.html" title="Australian Capital Territory">Australian Capital Territory</a> and <a href="/wiki/Tasmania.html" title="Tasmania">Tasmania</a> high school is 7-10, and students go to matriculation <a href="/wiki/College.html" title="College">college</a> for 11-12.</p>
<p>In some states <a href="/wiki/TAFE.html" title="TAFE">TAFE</a> institutes/colleges offer high school equivalent courses, usually undertaken by adult students who left school without completing/undertaking Year 12 leaving certificate requirements. There are also private commercial education facilities offering Year 12 leaving certificate courses, often to students wishing to improve on their High School results in order to obtain entry to, or better placement opportunities at, university.</p>
<p>The exact length of secondary schooling varies from state to state, with high schools in <a href="/wiki/New_South_Wales.html" title="New South Wales">New South Wales</a> and <a href="/wiki/Victoria_%28Australia%29.html" title="Victoria (Australia)">Victoria</a> serving years 7-12, and <a href="/wiki/Western_Australia.html" title="Western Australia">Western Australia</a>, <a href="/wiki/Queensland.html" title="Queensland">Queensland</a>, <a href="/wiki/Northern_Territory.html" title="Northern Territory">Northern Territory</a> and <a href="/wiki/South_Australia.html" title="South Australia">South Australia</a> serving years 8-12. In 2007 <a href="/wiki/Northern_Territory.html" title="Northern Territory">Northern Territory</a> is introducing a Middle School system for years 7-9 and high school will be years 10-12.</p>
<p>It is compulsory to attend school until the age of fifteen in all states and territories except for South Australia and Tasmania, where attendance is compulsory until age 16. In Western Australia the age has recently been raised to 16 and will be 17 from 2008.</p>
<p>The matter of compulsory attendance has been complicated by various initiatives at Commonwealth and State level to ensure that young people are in school, training or employment. There are calls to replace compulsory attendance age with compulsory achievement requirements, meaning that students must complete their final year level rather than being able to leave at reaching "leaving age". There are also calls to make attendance to the end of year 12 mandatory.</p>

<p>Secondary schooling in Canada differs depending on the province in which one resides. Normally it follows the American pattern (see:<a  class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_school#United_States">Secondary School in United States</a>); however, in <a href="/wiki/Quebec.html" title="Quebec">Quebec</a>, high school is from Secondary 1 to Secondary 5 (<a href="/wiki/Grade.html" title="Grade">grades</a> 7 to 11<a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.meq.gouv.qc.ca/daic/pdf/educqceng.pdf">[1]</a>). In Quebec most students follow high school by attending a <a href="/wiki/CEGEP.html" title="CEGEP">CÉGEP</a>, which is comparable to a two-year junior college and is obligatory for Quebec students wishing to go on to university in Quebec. Vocational CÉGEP is three years. Secondary schools in <a href="/wiki/New_Brunswick.html" title="New Brunswick">New Brunswick</a>, <a href="/wiki/Saskatchewan.html" title="Saskatchewan">Saskatchewan</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Manitoba.html" title="Manitoba">Manitoba</a> consist of four grades from 9 through 12. In <a href="/wiki/Ontario.html" title="Ontario">Ontario</a> secondary schools consist of four grades from 9 through 12 and generally has a set up similar to that in the United States. Students usually graduate from high school in the year of their 18th birthday if they were born between January 1 and August 31, or in the following year if they were born between September 1 and December 31</p>
<p>In Alberta, Newfoundland and Labrador, Prince Edward Island and Nova Scotia, a secondary school is called a "senior high school", which teaches grades 10-12. A middle school is called a "junior high school", and teaches grades 7-9. Most senior high schools simply have "high school" in their name, without including the word "senior". If not stated, the term "high school" usually just refers to a "senior high school". <a href="/wiki/British_Columbia.html" title="British Columbia">British Columbia</a> uses a system similar to Alberta (grade 8-, 9-, 10-, or 11-12, depending on regional school boards). In some sections of British Columbia, high school lasts from grade 8-12, with elementary school being from kindergarten to grade 7, while in others a Middle School from grades 6-8 is implemented. In Ontario, it varies depending on the region or school board. It is common to have elementary schools teach grades kindergarten to grade 8, and High schools teach grades 9-12. But middle schools are also common.</p>
<p>Historically several provinces had two secondary education programs. High schools were to prepare students to enter the workforce while <a href="/wiki/Collegiate_institutes.html" title="Collegiate institutes">collegiate institutes</a> prepared students for <a href="/wiki/University.html" title="University">university</a>.</p>
<p>The national drop out rate in Canada (2002 - 2005) was 10.1%, meaning approximately 90% of Canadian students complete high school. Out of all 10 provinces, Manitoba has the highest drop out rate at 13% meaning about 87% of all students in Manitoba complete high school.</p>

<p>In <a href="/wiki/Mainland_China.html" title="Mainland China">Mainland China</a>, high school (gaozhong or 高中) refers to years 10 to 12. Broadly, it includes both the college-bound "regular high schools" (普通中学) and technical high schools (职业高级中学/中学专科/中专), although informal usage refers to the first. Students at regular high schools may be further divided into two streams at the 11th year, with different emphasis: social/humanities (wenke or 文科) and science/engineering (li-ke or 理科). This division is similar to that in <i>lycée général</i> (see <a href="/wiki/Secondary_education_in_France.html" title="Secondary education in France">secondary education in France</a>). The <a href="/wiki/National_College_Entrance_Examination.html" title="National College Entrance Examination">National College Entrance Examination</a> is administered differently between these streams.</p>

<p>Secondary education in <a href="/wiki/Hong_Kong.html" title="Hong Kong">Hong Kong</a> is largely based on the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom.html" title="United Kingdom">British</a> schooling system. High school starts on the 7th year of formal education, after Primary Six, called Form One. Students normally spend five years in secondary schools, of which the first three years (Forms One to Three) are free and compulsory like <a href="/wiki/Primary_education.html" title="Primary education">primary education</a>. Forms Four and Five students prepare for the Hong Kong Certificate of Education Examination (<a href="/wiki/Hong_Kong_Certificate_of_Education_Examination.html" title="Hong Kong Certificate of Education Examination">HKCEE</a>), which takes place after Form Five. Students obtaining a satisfactory grade will be promoted to Form Six, who then prepare for the Hong Kong Advanced Level Examination (<a href="/wiki/Hong_Kong_Advanced_Level_Examination.html" title="Hong Kong Advanced Level Examination">HKALE</a>) (<a href="/wiki/Colloquial.html" title="Colloquial">colloquially</a> <i>the <a href="/wiki/A-levels.html" title="A-levels">A-levels</a></i>), which is to be taken after Form Seven. The HKALE and HKCEE results will be considered by <a href="/wiki/Universities.html" title="Universities">universities</a> for admission. Some secondary schools in Hong Kong are called 'colleges'. In some schools, Form Six and Form Seven are also called Lower Six and Upper Six respectively.</p>
<p>The HKCEE and HKALE is equivalent to the GCE O-level (or GCSE) and the GCE A-level respectively.</p>
<p>As of Oct 2004, there has been heated discussion on proposed changes in the education system, which includes (amongst others) reduction of the duration of secondary education from seven years to six years, and merge the two exams HKCEE and HKALE into one exam. The proposed changes will be in effect within the next few years.</p>

<h2>India</h2>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/India.html" title="India">India</a>, high school, as such, does not exist: instead, 9th and 10th Grade (i.e., Classes IX and X) form part of a formal contingent course ending in the <a href="/wiki/Secondary_School_Certificate.html" title="Secondary School Certificate">Secondary School Certificate</a> (SSC) examinations, or <a href="/wiki/Board_examination.html" title="Board examination">board examinations</a>, at the end of Grade 10. 11th and 12th grade are considered part of "junior college" or "higher secondary school". This is actually a relatively intense pre-university program often at a separate institution, culminating in another round of board examinations, the <a  class="new" title="Higher Secondary (School) Certificate">Higher Secondary (School) Certificate</a> (HSC) examinations. Also, the terminology depends upon the states and also upon the very school itself. E.g., in <a href="/wiki/Uttar_Pradesh.html" title="Uttar Pradesh">Uttar Pradesh</a> and most other north Indian states, the term High School means Classes IX and X, leading to board exams in class X, and the term <i>Intermediate</i> means the Classes XI and XII, leading to the final board exam of schooling. Such a school leading to Class XII is often called "Inter college". In most Christian missionary-run and other privately-run schools, these terms Highschool and Intermediate are almost never used; instead, the Grades are referred to as from Class I to Class XII (such schools often run Grades from the entire 1st to 12th Class). Classes X and XII have all-India or all-state common Board exams, which have great significance in contemporary India. Earlier, the Class X and XII Board exams always included the syllabi of Classes IX and XI respectively. But now most Boards have dropped this additional burden, except for languages. The term "High School Certificate", often required by universities and government offices as a proof not only of educational qualification, but also of the proper name and date of birth, is the Board Exam's pass certificate of Class X.</p>

<p>The Japanese word for a high school is <i>kōtōgakkō</i> (高等学校; literally <i>high school</i>), or <i>kōkō</i> (高校) in short. High school in Japan covers years 10 through 12, and it is not mandatory. Most Japanese pupils attend high school. High schools in Japan are referred to by <a href="/wiki/Ministry_of_Education%2C_Culture%2C_Sports%2C_Science_and_Technology_%28Japan%29.html" title="Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (Japan)">MEXT</a> as "upper secondary schools." However most English-language newspapers and sources use the term "high school". Many school boards also use "high school"; for instance the <a href="/wiki/Tokyo_Metropolitan_Government_Board_of_Education.html" title="Tokyo Metropolitan Government Board of Education">Tokyo Metropolitan Government Board of Education</a> uses "senior high school".</p>

<p>Secondary education, like <a href="/wiki/Primary_education.html" title="Primary education">primary education</a> is now compulsory in Malaysia. Primary schools run from Year 1 to Year 6 (also known as Standard 1 to 6, for children aged 6+ to 12+), at the end of which they sit for the UPSR (<a  class="new" title="Ujian Penilaian Sekolah Rendah">Ujian Penilaian Sekolah Rendah</a> or Primary School Assessment Examination). Secondary schools run for seven years, known as Forms 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, Lower 6 and Upper 6. Not all schools offer all forms. Many secondary schools stop at Form 5.

This replaced the SRP (Sijil Rendah Pelajaran) or LCE (Lower Certificate of Education) where a pass was required for promotion to Form 4. At the end of Form 5, pupils sit for the SPM (<a href="/wiki/Sijil_Pelajaran_Malaysia.html" title="Sijil Pelajaran Malaysia">Sijil Pelajaran Malaysia</a> or MCE Malaysia Certificate of Education), equivalent to the <a href="/wiki/O-Level.html" title="O-Level">O-Level</a> examination. (The label is based on the old British examination known as the 'School Certificate' examination.) At the end of Upper 6, pupils sit for the STPM (<a href="/wiki/Sijil_Tinggi_Pelajaran_Malaysia.html" title="Sijil Tinggi Pelajaran Malaysia">Sijil Tinggi Pelajaran Malaysia</a>, formerly HSC Higher School Certificate). (The label is based on the old British examination, the 'Higher School Certificate', and this name is still used in Australia.) Automatic promotion up to Form 5 has been in place since 1996.</p>

<p>Based on results of the <a href="/wiki/Primary_School_Leaving_Examination.html" title="Primary School Leaving Examination">Primary School Leaving Examination</a> (PSLE), <a href="/wiki/Singapore.html" title="Singapore">Singapore</a>'s students undergo secondary education in either the Special, Express, Normal courses or the Integrated Programme which was implemented in 2004. Both the Special and Express are 4-year courses leading up to a Singapore-<a href="/wiki/Cambridge.html" title="Cambridge">Cambridge</a> <a href="/wiki/General_Certificate_of_Education.html" title="General Certificate of Education">General Certificate of Education</a> (GCE) 'Ordinary' - 'O' level examination. The difference between Special and Express is that the former's mother tongue language (English and Mother Tongue) are taught at a higher level (more difficult).</p>
<p>The Normal course is a 4-year course leading up to a Singapore-Cambridge GCE "Normal" - "N" level examination, with the possibility of a 5th year followed by a Singapore-Cambridge GCE "Ordinary" - "O" level examination. It is split into "Normal (Academic)" and "Normal (Technical)" where in the latter students take subjects that are technical in nature, such as Design and Technology.</p>
<p>After the second year of a secondary school course, students are typically streamed into a wide range of course combinations, making the total number of subject they have to sit for in "O" level six to ten subjects. This includes science (Physics, Biology and Chemistry), humanities (Elective Geography/History, Pure Geography/History, Social Studies, Literature, etc.) and additional mathematics subject at a higher level, or "combined" subject modules.</p>
<p>Some schools have done away with the O level examination, and pupils only sit for the A level examination or the International Baccalaureate at the end of their sixth year (known as Year 6 in Anglo-Chinese School Independent, or Junior College 2 in the Raffles Schools).</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Co-curricular_activity.html" title="Co-curricular activity">Co-curricular activities</a> have become compulsory at the Secondary level, where all pupils must participate in at least one core CCA, and participation is graded together with other things like Leadership throughout the four years of Secondary education, in a scoring system.

<p>The secondary education in Taiwan includes junior high school, senior high school, vocational high school, military school, and complete high school. The traditional secondary education institutions were established in "Japanese colonial <a href="/wiki/Time.html" title="Time">time</a>." Today, they include many features from the United States.</p>
<p>After six years in elementary school, the rules state that children must enter junior high school, or their parents may be fined. There are three grades in junior high. Children who achieve the third grade can choose to enter senior high school, vocational high school, or complete high school. If children want to continue their formal education, they must sit for an exam. Generally speaking, the grade to enter high school and complete high school is highest, while it is lower to go on to vocational high school and military school.</p>
<p>Senior high school has three grades. Graduates from senior high school often continue on to university. Vocational high school has three grades as well. Children who complete vocational high school can then enter a technological university. Complete high school is like that of American high schools, in that it has grades seven to grade twelve.</p>
<p>There are also international schools such as Taipei American School (TAS) and Taipei British School (TBS). These schools are from grade 1 to grade 12. English is spoken during all courses. Since the curriculum concurrs with the corresponding country's curriculum, graduates from these international schools generally do not stay in Taiwan for their undergraduate degree.</p>

In a few parts of the UK there are <a href="/wiki/Middle_school.html" title="Middle school">middle schools</a> for ages 9 to 13 (similar to American middle schools), and <a href="/wiki/Upper_school.html" title="Upper school">upper schools</a> for ages 13-18. It is uncommon, but sometimes secondary schools (particularly in South West Wales) can also be split into 'Upper' (ages 13-16) and 'Lower' secondary schools (ages 11-13).</p>
<p>Education is compulsory up until the end of year 11 (the last Friday in June in the year a person turns 16), and schooling can continue for a further 2 years after that. Traditionally the five years of compulsory secondary schooling from ages 11 to 16 were known as "first year" through to "fifth year," but were renamed a decade ago to Year 7 through to Year 11 (Year 8 to Year 12 in Northern Ireland). After Year 11 a student can opt to remain at school, transfer to a <a href="/wiki/College.html" title="College">college</a>, or to leave education and seek work. Those who stay at school enter Years 12 and 13 (Years 13 and 14 in Northern Ireland). These years are traditionally known as the <a href="/wiki/Sixth_Form.html" title="Sixth Form">Sixth Form</a> ("Lower Sixth" and "Upper Sixth"), and required students to specialise in three to five subjects for their <a href="/wiki/A_Level.html" title="A Level">A Levels</a>.

<p>This is an unusually specialised curriculum for this age group by international standards, and recently some moves have been made to increase the number of subjects studied.

<p>In <a href="/wiki/Scotland.html" title="Scotland">Scotland</a>, the education system is different from that in the rest of the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom.html" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>. Although both school systems allow for thirteen years of education, pupils transfer to Scottish secondary schools after their seventh year of primary school (known as Primary 7; pupils are usually eleven or twelve years old at the end of this year) - a year later than elsewhere in the British Isles. In England and Wales, Year 7 is normally the first year of secondary school.</p>
<p>It must be noted that <a href="/wiki/Sixth_form_college.html" title="Sixth form college">sixth form colleges</a> do not have an equivalent in Scotland; S5 and S6 are always part of secondary school.

<p>In the United States, high schools generally consists of <a href="/wiki/School_grades_%28US%29.html" title="School grades (US)">grades</a> 9, 10, 11, and 12, although the inclusion of grade 9 varies by school district. Students usually graduate from high school in the year of their 18th birthday if they were born between January 1 and August 31, or in the following year if they were born between September 1 and December 31, except in New York (where all students usually graduate in the year of their 18th birthday) and California (where students usually graduate in the year of their 18th birthday if they were born between January 1 and November 30, or in the following year if they were born between December 1 and December 31). A few American schools still incorporate grades 7 through 12, but the norm is usually either grades 9-12 or grades 10-12. For purposes of the GPA and subject requirements used for college admission, grade 9 is usually considered the first year of high school regardless of whether the student is in the last year of a 7-9 junior high program, or the first year of a 9-12 high school program. High school is generally defined as being grades 9-12, while "secondary" school, or "secondary" education refers to grades 7-12. Secondary Education teachers are certified to teach grades 7 through 12.</p>
<p>About 90% of American students complete high school, however in some cities the graduation rate is much lower (such as in <a href="/wiki/Santa_Ana%2C_California.html" title="Santa Ana, California">Santa Ana</a> and <a href="/wiki/Los_Angeles%2C_California.html" title="Los Angeles, California">Los Angeles, California</a>, where less than 50% of students graduate).<a  class="external autonumber" title="http://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d04/tables/dt04_107.asp">[3]</a><a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ed.gov/pubs/OR/ConsumerGuides/dropout.html">[4]</a> A high school diploma or <a href="/wiki/GED.html" title="GED">GED</a> certificate is usually required for entrance into a two or four-year <a href="/wiki/College.html" title="College">college</a> or <a href="/wiki/University.html" title="University">university</a> and to other post-secondary education programs.</p>
<p>As a practical matter, while laws in most states mandate school attendance at least until graduation or age 16, enforcement of the <a href="/wiki/Truancy.html" title="Truancy">truancy</a> laws is sporadic. Conversely, students who have failed a grade may remain in high school past the age of 18. In general, students over 18 attend alternative high schools, with the end result being attainment of a GED. State laws vary on the cut-off age for students to receive free public education services. Students in New York state can attend regular public schools until the age of 21.</p>
