<h2>History</h2>
<p>The idea of Georgia Institute of Technology was introduced in 1865 during the <a href="/wiki/Reconstruction.html" title="Reconstruction">Reconstruction</a> period. Two former <a href="/wiki/Confederate_States_of_America.html" title="Confederate States of America">Confederate</a> officers, Major John Fletcher Hanson and Nathaniel Edwin Harris, who had become prominent citizens in the town of <a href="/wiki/Macon%2C_Georgia.html" title="Macon, Georgia">Macon, Georgia</a> after the war, strongly believed that the South needed to improve its technology to compete with the <a href="/wiki/Industrial_revolution.html" title="Industrial revolution">industrial revolution</a> that was occuring throughout the North. Many Southerners at this time agreed with this idea. However, because the American South of that era was mainly comprised of agricultural workers and minimal technical developments were occuring, a technology school was needed. <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.library.gatech.edu/gtbuildings/history_frame.htm">[1]</a></p>
<p>Macon was considered an ideal location for a new technology college because of its relatively advanced mechanical development, but developers decided to build the technology school in Atlanta instead.</p>
<p>In 1882, prominent Georgians, authorized by the Georgia state legislature and led by Harris, formed a committee and visited the Northeast to see firsthand how technology schools worked. Using examples from the <a href="/wiki/Worcester_Polytechnic_Institute.html" title="Worcester Polytechnic Institute">Worcester County Free Institute of Industrial Science</a> (now <a href="/wiki/Worcester_Polytechnic_Institute.html" title="Worcester Polytechnic Institute">Worcester Polytechnic Institute</a>) and Boston Tech (now <a href="/wiki/Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology.html" title="Massachusetts Institute of Technology">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a>), the Atlanta technology school began development on the Worcester Free Institute model, which stressed a combination of "theory and practice", the "practice" component including student employment and production of consumer items to generate revenue for the school.</p>
<p>The Georgia School of Technology opened its doors in the fall of 1885 with only two buildings (designed by Bruce and Morgan, the leading architectural firm in Atlanta of that era; in the popular High Victorian style heavily promoted by English art critic <a href="/wiki/John_Ruskin.html" title="John Ruskin">John Ruskin</a>). One building (now Tech Tower and the Admissions Office) had classrooms to teach students. The other building was the shop and had a foundry, forge, boiler room and engine room. It was designed specifically for students to work and produce actual products for sale. The shop building also provided the heating for the classroom building. Both of the buildings were equal in size to show the importance of teaching both the mind and the hands.</p>
<p>The machine shop at Georgia Tech received criticism in the 1890s (especially in the wake of the shop's destruction in an 1892 fire and its subsequent rapid rebuilding). Many consumers were buying student-made products from Georgia Tech at very low prices. One professor noted that "shop should be used for instruction, not construction". He stated that the machine shop at Georgia Tech should not be used to make profits.</p>
<p>The school was men's only until the first female students were admitted in 1952. In 1961, Georgia Tech became the first university in the Deep South to admit African American students without a court order.</p>
<p>The school continued to expand. Ultimately, the eastward expansion of the campus was blocked by the I-75/I-85 <a href="/wiki/Downtown_Connector.html" title="Downtown Connector">Downtown Connector</a>. Most of the buildings were renovated in the 1960s to acommodate the growing number of students.</p>

<p>Founded on <a href="/wiki/October_13.html" title="October 13">October 13</a>, <a href="/wiki/1885.html" title="1885">1885</a> as the <b>Georgia School of Technology</b>, it assumed its present name in 1948. Unlike similarly-named universities (such as the <a href="/wiki/Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology.html" title="Massachusetts Institute of Technology">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a> and the <a href="/wiki/California_Institute_of_Technology.html" title="California Institute of Technology">California Institute of Technology</a>), the Georgia Institute of Technology is a <a href="/wiki/Public_university.html" title="Public university">public</a> institution.</p>
<p>Georgia Tech is sometimes called the <b>North Avenue Trade School</b>, although this was never its official title. The name stems from the fact that the campus is bordered to the south by North Avenue, and that (as mentioned above) the school in its earlier years was operated much like a <a href="/wiki/Trade_school.html" title="Trade school">trade school</a>, with students working part of the day in a machine shop, and the other part of the day in classrooms. Today the name is still used in a <a href="/wiki/In-joke.html" title="In-joke">humorous</a> manner: the campus bookstore even sells shirts bearing the name "North Avenue Trade School."</p>

<h3>Location</h3>
<p>The school was located near the northern <a href="/wiki/City_limits.html" title="City limits">city limits</a> of Atlanta at the time of its founding (although the city has now expanded several miles beyond it). A historical marker on the large hill in <a href="/wiki/Georgia_Institute_of_Technology#Central_Campus.html" title="Georgia Institute of Technology">Central Campus</a> notes that the site occupied by the school's first buildings once held fortifications built to protect Atlanta during the <a href="/wiki/Atlanta_Campaign.html" title="Atlanta Campaign">Atlanta Campaign</a> of the <a href="/wiki/American_Civil_War.html" title="American Civil War">American Civil War</a>. The surrender of the city took place on the southwestern boundary of the modern Georgia Tech campus in 1864. <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://sherpaguides.com/georgia/civil_war/atlanta/westview_area.html">[2]</a></p>

<p>Recently, Georgia Tech has sought to strengthen its undergraduate and graduate offerings in less technical fields, such as public policy, international affairs, economics, modern languages, history and sociology, communication and cultural studies, and digital media.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Student life">edit</a>]</div>

<h2>Student life</h2>
<p>Set on a spacious campus in the middle of trendy <a href="/wiki/Midtown_Atlanta.html" title="Midtown Atlanta">Midtown Atlanta</a>, and with a rich tradition of top-ranked athletic teams and student activities, Tech students have a plethora of social options to choose from.</p>
<p>On campus, <a href="/wiki/Fraternities_and_sororities.html" title="Fraternities and sororities">fraternities and sororities</a> play a central role in the social scene, and nearly a quarter (22%) of Tech students are members of these organizations. Drawing upon students' engineering prowess, many fraternities host raucous parties that feature creative themes and elaborate <a href="/wiki/Scenic_design.html" title="Scenic design">set designs</a> and <a href="/wiki/Theatrical_properties.html" title="Theatrical properties">props</a>. Outside of the party scene, a number of student organizations play a central role in the lives of Tech students in other ways. Georgia Tech has over three hundred <a  class="external text" title="http://cyberbuzz.gatech.edu/main/organizations/organizations_results.php?SearchALL=on&amp;limitby=orgname&amp;SearchText=">student organizations</a>, which range from professional clubs to religious organizations, and these all play a large part in the life of an average student at Tech. Tech students are traditionally very active in student organizations, with over 80% of students participating in at least one student organization.<sup title="The text in the vicinity of this tag needs citation." class="noprint">[<a  title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><i>citation&#160;needed</i></a>]</sup></p>
<p>Due to the prominence of Georgia Tech's athletic programs, attending athletic events is always a popular option for students. The school's men's basketball, football, women's volleyball, and baseball games are well-attended by both current students and alums.</p>
<p>In terms of off-campus social options, being located in the middle of a young and vibrant city like Atlanta offers a number of advantages to Tech students. Just off campus, there are several establishments that act as local watering holes for students. Rocky Mountain Pizza, Peachtree Tavern, and Moondogs are all very popular student spots. Meanwhile, "Home Park", a neighborhood that borders the north end of campus, is a popular living area for Tech students and recent grads, and a number of parties and barbecues are hosted by the neighborhood's residents.</p>
<p>Of course, the downside to being a student at one of the most elite and rigorous engineering schools in the world is that students often don't have a lot of free time with which to explore all of these social options. Quoting the <a  class="external text" title="http://www.princetonreview.com/">Princeton Review</a> summary of student life, "Because of the heavy workload at Georgia Tech, most students are overly stressed, worried about tomorrow's test, and driven by the desire for the degree. Students have only minimal time for social functions". The high levels of stress were the likely causes of a recent <i><a href="/wiki/U.S._News_%26_World_Report.html" title="U.S. News &amp; World Report">U.S. News &amp; World Report</a></i> which listed Georgia Tech as the 17th most alcoholic school in the nation â the only school on the list that hasn't ever been listed in The Princeton Review's top party schools.</p>
<p>The school's administration has endeavored to reduce the levels of anxiety felt by many Tech students. Most notable have been the administration's FASET (Familiarization and Adaptation to the Surroundings and Environs of Tech) and Freshmen Experience (a freshman only dorm life program to encourage friendships and a feeling of social involvement) programs, which help to acclimate new students to their surroundings and foster a greater sense of community.</p>
<p>Other school initiatives aimed at improving student life include the administration's efforts to boost <a href="/wiki/Female.html" title="Female">female</a> enrollment at the school. Historically, female enrollment at engineering institutions has been quite low, and Georgia Tech is no exception. With about three times as many <a href="/wiki/Male.html" title="Male">male</a> students as females, Georgia Tech has one of the most unbalanced male-to-female ratios of any <a href="/wiki/Coeducation.html" title="Coeducation">co-ed</a> university. However, this is slowly changing, presumably due to the university's growing liberal arts programs, as well as outreach programs to encourage more female high school students to consider careers in science and engineering, such as the "Women In Engineering" program. The freshman class of 2005â2006 currently has one of the most balanced male/female ratios to date at 69% to 31%.</p>

</ul>
<ul>
<li>Since its inception in 1996, the <a  class="external text" title="http://harmony.gatech.edu/orchestra/">Georgia Tech Symphony Orchestra</a> has grown from a dozen interested students into an 80+ member ensemble. It is now one of the largest performance groups on campus.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Founded in 1906, the Glee Club is the oldest student organization on campus, and was among the first collegiate choral groups to release a recording of their songs. The group has toured extensively and appeared on the Ed Sullivan show twice, providing worldwide exposure to "Ramblin' Wreck from Georgia Tech".</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The Georgia Tech Athletic Bands play a crucial part for school spirit and athletic support. The Marching Band consistently fields over 300 members and even invites students from other Atlanta Area Universities who do not have football programs (Georgia State, Emory, Agnes Scott, Kennesaw State, etc) to participate.</li>

<h2>Campus</h2>
<p>The Georgia Tech campus is located in <a href="/wiki/Midtown_Atlanta.html" title="Midtown Atlanta">Midtown</a>, an area north of downtown Atlanta. Although a number of <a href="/wiki/Skyscraper.html" title="Skyscraper">skyscrapers</a> are visible from all points on campus â most notably the headquarters of both <a href="/wiki/BellSouth.html" title="BellSouth">BellSouth</a> and <a href="/wiki/The_Coca-Cola_Company.html" title="The Coca-Cola Company">The Coca-Cola Company</a> as well as Atlanta's tallest building, the <a href="/wiki/Bank_of_America.html" title="Bank of America">Bank of America</a> building â the campus itself has few buildings over four stories and has a great deal of greenery. This gives it a distinctly <a href="/wiki/Suburb.html" title="Suburb">suburban</a> atmosphere quite different from other Atlanta campuses such as that of <a href="/wiki/Georgia_State_University.html" title="Georgia State University">Georgia State University</a> or <a href="/wiki/Emory_University.html" title="Emory University">Emory University</a>.</p>
<p>The campus is organized into four main parts: West Campus, East Campus, Central Campus, and <a href="/wiki/Technology_Square.html" title="Technology Square">Technology Square</a>. West Campus and East Campus are both occupied primarily by student living complexes, while Central Campus is reserved primarily for teaching and research buildings.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: West Campus">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="West_Campus" id="West_Campus"></a></p>
<h3>West Campus</h3>
<p>West Campus is occupied primarily by apartments and coed undergraduate dormitories. The Campus Recreation Center (formerly the Student Athletic Complex), a <a href="/wiki/Volleyball.html" title="Volleyball">volleyball</a> court, a large, low natural green area known as the <a href="/wiki/Burger_Bowl.html" title="Burger Bowl">Burger Bowl</a>, a large, and a flat artificial green area known as the SAC Fields are all located on the western side of the campus. Also within easy walking distance of West Campus is City Cafe, which is open 24 hours, Rocky Mountain Pizza, and Engineer's Bookstore, an alternative to Georgia Tech's official bookstore. West Campus is also home to a music club operated by students called <i>Under the Couch</i><sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a  title="">[2]</a></sup> as well as a small diner and convenience store, West Side Market. Due to limited space, all auto travel proceeds via a network of one-way streets which connects West Campus to Ferst Drive, the main road of the campus. Woodruff Dining Hall, or "Woody's," is the West Campus Dining Hall. It connects the Woodruff North and Woodruff South undergraduate dorms.</p>

<h3>East Campus</h3>
<p>East Campus houses all of the Fraternities and Sororities as well as most of the undergraduate freshman dormitories. Although the residences are similar, East Campus is decidedly more urban than West Campus. East Campus abuts on the <a href="/wiki/Downtown_Connector.html" title="Downtown Connector">Downtown Connector</a>. Via a number of bridges over the highway as well as a tunnel under it, East Campus has quick access to Midtown and its businesses such as <a href="/wiki/The_Varsity.html" title="The Varsity">The Varsity</a>.

<p>Central Campus is home to the majority of the Academic, Research, and Administrative buildings. It includes among others: the Howey Physics Building; the Boggs Chemistry Building; the College of Computing; the Skiles Classroom Building, which houses the School of Mathematics and the School of Literature, Communication and Culture; the D.M. Smith Building, which houses the School of Public Policy and the School of History, Technology, and Society; and the Ford Environmental Science &amp; Technology Building. In 2005, the School of Modern Languages returned to the Swann Building, a 100-year-old former dorm that now houses some of the most technology-equipped classrooms on campus. Intermingled with these are a variety of research facilities, such as the Centennial Research Building, the Pettit Microelectronics Research Center, the Electronic Research Building, and the Petit Biotechnology Building. Tech's administrative buildings, such as the Student Services Building ("Flag Building"), Tech Tower, and the Bursar's Office are also located here. The campus library, a small traditional eatery called <a href="/wiki/Junior%27s_Grill.html" title="Junior's Grill">Junior's Grill</a>, as well as a large communal building for students, the Fred B. Wenn Student Center are also located on Central Campus. The Student Center provides a variety of recreational and social functions for students including a computer lab, a game room ("Tech Rec"), the Student Post Office, a darkened Music Listening Room, a movie theater, a Food Court, as well as meeting rooms for various clubs and organizations. Adjacent to the eastern entrance of the Student Center is the <a href="/wiki/Kessler_Campanile.html" title="Kessler Campanile">Kessler Campanile</a>, which is commonly referred to by students as "The Shaft."

<p>Tech's fight song <a href="/wiki/Ramblin%27_Wreck_from_Georgia_Tech.html" title="Ramblin' Wreck from Georgia Tech">"I'm a Ramblin' Wreck from Georgia Tech"</a> is known worldwide. It was adapted from an old drinking song ("Son of a Gambolier"), and embellished with trumpet flourishes by Frank Roman. In 1959, then VP <a href="/wiki/Richard_Nixon.html" title="Richard Nixon">Richard Nixon</a> and <a href="/wiki/Nikita_Khrushchev.html" title="Nikita Khrushchev">Nikita Khrushchev</a> sang it together when they had their famous cold war confrontation in Moscow, to reduce the tension. Nixon didn't know any Russian songs, but Khrushchev knew that one American one. It was sung on the <a href="/wiki/Ed_Sullivan.html" title="Ed Sullivan">Ed Sullivan</a> show. It was played in space. <a href="/wiki/Gregory_Peck.html" title="Gregory Peck">Gregory Peck</a> sang it while strumming a ukulele in <i><a href="/wiki/The_Man_in_the_Gray_Flannel_Suit.html" title="The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit">The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit</a>.</i> <a href="/wiki/John_Wayne.html" title="John Wayne">John Wayne</a> whistled it in <i><a href="/wiki/The_High_and_the_Mighty_%28movie%29.html" title="The High and the Mighty (movie)">The High and the Mighty</a></i>. It is played after every GT score in a football game. The Edwin H. Morris &amp; Company (later acquired by Paul McCartney's company, MPL) obtained a copyright in 1931.</p>
<p>There are multiple explanations for where how the term "Ramblin' Wrecks" became associated with Georgia Tech. The most plausible is that many GT engineering grads found jobs in the jungles of South America in the early 1900s, where they concocted mechanical contraptions to tame the jungle and get around. The first Ramblin' Wreck of record was a 1914 Ford Model T owned by Floyd Field, Tech's first dean of men. In 1961, a gold and white Model A, known as the Ramblin' Wreck, led the team onto the field for the first time, and it has done so at home games ever since.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a  title="">[3]</a></sup> The annual "Ramblin' Wreck" parade at Homecoming displays some really strange contraptions, judged for ingenuity.</p>
<p>Tech has seventeen varsity sports. In men's sports, in addition to football, basketball, and baseball, there's golf, tennis, swimming &amp; diving, track &amp; field, and cross country. For women, there's basketball, softball, volleyball, tennis, swimming &amp; diving, track &amp; field, and cross-country. Fourteen of these sports finished in the top 25 during the 2004-5 school year.</p>

Georgia Tech's Tech Tower</div>
</div>
</div>
<ul>
<li><b>Stealing the T</b>: Tech's historic primary administrative building, Tech Tower, has the letters TECH hanging atop it on each of its four sides. A number of times, students have orchestrated complex plans to steal the huge symbolic letter T, and on occasion have carried this act out successfully. The T was then returned at its traditional time, and the student's achievement celebrated. Stealing the T is sometimes also called <i>climbing</i>. Although the administration used to <a href="/wiki/Turn_a_blind_eye.html" title="Turn a blind eye">turn a blind eye</a> to this practice, it is now officially discouraged, due to the risk of fatal falls and the potential for damage to the building. Security features such as pressure sensitive roof tiling and fiber optic cabling running throughout the letters have been added to the T to help prevent its theft and aid in catching the perpetrators. The last successful stealing of the "T" occurred in 1999 and to this day, the location of that "T" is unknown. Tradition dictates that the first T to be stolen should be the one facing east, as this can most easily be seen from the <a href="/wiki/Downtown_Connector.html" title="Downtown Connector">Downtown Connector</a>.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a  title="">[5]</a></sup></li>
<li><b>The Whistle</b>: A steam whistle that blows five minutes before the hour, every hour from 6:55am to 5:55pm. This tradition is a hold over from the trade school days, originally used to mark the end of a shift in the shops; now it is used both to mark the end of classes and as a ten minute warning to the beginning of the next classes. It is also blown when Georgia Tech wins a football game, most often home games.</li>
<li><b>Triple Play</b>: This is a shorthand term for executing 3 or more of the several officially discouraged traditions. They include stealing the T, climbing "the shaft" (Campanile), swimming naked in the president's pool, climbing the coliseum, climbing the stadium lights, and jumping off the 10 meter high dive.</li>
<li><b>To Hell With Georgia</b>: Georgia Tech has an ongoing rivalry, mostly in sports, with the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Georgia.html" title="University of Georgia">University of Georgia</a>, often simply called <i>Georgia</i> for short (the schools are a mere 90 miles apart). An annual issue of the school newspaper, <i><a href="/wiki/The_Technique.html" title="The Technique">The Technique</a></i>, focuses on this rivalry with an issue that spoofs <a href="/wiki/The_Red_and_Black.html" title="The Red and Black">The Red and Black</a>, the newspaper of the University of Georgia. As a dig at the rival school, the <i>Technique</i> will typically refer to it as "the University (sic) of Georgia" in articles. "To Hell With Georgia" is also known as "The good word." If one student asks another "What's the Good Word?" the response is always "To Hell with Georgia!"</li>
<li><b>RAT Caps</b>: Every year new freshmen are given yellow caps and a number of freshmen wear yellow baseball caps throughout the year, most notably freshmen band members. RAT is short for "Recruit At Tech", although freshman are sometimes addressed as RATS, or "Recently Acquired Tech Students". <sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a  title="">[6]</a></sup> The RAT caps are decorated with the football team's scores, the freshman's major, expected graduation date, and "To Hell With Georgia" emblazoned on the back of the cap. Freshmen caught not wearing the cap had their hair forcibly shaved into the shape of a T, however anti-hazing laws eliminated this threat and (by proxy) widespread usage of the RAT caps. The tradition of RAT caps is maintained mostly by the marching band.</li>
<li><b><a href="/wiki/George_P._Burdell.html" title="George P. Burdell">George P. Burdell</a></b>: The legendary imaginary student George P. Burdell is said to possess nearly every degree Georgia Tech offers, after many students took a variety of classes in his name. Since the 1960's, some students have managed to ensure that George P. Burdell is always enrolled at the university in the school's registrar's computers. The initial forged enrollment was performed in the era of computer punch cards. When Tech switched to online class registration, Burdell managed to get his name on the roll for every single course offered that term. After initially vigorously searching for the <a href="/wiki/Hackers.html" title="Hackers">hackers</a>, the university has since accepted the presence of George P. Burdell in every year's class. George has also had a computer-printed report card generated. George was a sophomore majoring in civil engineering and taking five courses that quarter. His grades were A, B, C, D, and F. George P. Burdell is also a common tool for pranks at various school events and games. He usually gets paged over the stadium public address system at away sporting events.</li>
<li><b><a href="/wiki/Georgia_Tech_v._Cumberland%2C_1916.html" title="Georgia Tech v. Cumberland, 1916">The Cumberland Game</a></b>: College football game with the largest margin of victory in history. In 1916, Georgia Tech's football team (coached by the legendary <a href="/wiki/John_Heisman.html" title="John Heisman">John Heisman</a> -- for whom the <a href="/wiki/Heisman_trophy.html" title="Heisman trophy">trophy</a> is named) defeated Cumberland 222-0. Cumberland's total net yardage was -28 (minus 28), and it had only one play for positive yards. Neither team got a first down (Georgia Tech scored every time it got the ball). Cumberland beat Georgia Tech's baseball team 22 to 0 the previous year. <sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a  title="">[7]</a></sup></li>
<li><b>41-38</b>: Score of two momentous victories by <a href="/wiki/Georgia_Tech.html" title="Georgia Tech">Georgia Tech</a> over the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Virginia.html" title="University of Virginia">University of Virginia</a> in <a href="/wiki/College_football.html" title="College football">college football</a>, hence a Tech rallying cry whenever the two teams meet. In 1990, Virginia won its first seven games and had a #1 ranking in both polls. Undefeated but unheralded Georgia Tech came into <a href="/wiki/Scott_Stadium.html" title="Scott Stadium">Scott Stadium</a> in <a href="/wiki/Charlottesville%2C_Virginia.html" title="Charlottesville, Virginia">Charlottesville</a> and beat the Cavaliers 41-38 on a last-second field goal by Scott Sisson. In 1998, the first year since 1990 that both teams had come into this game with high hopes, #25 GT hosted undefeated #7 UVa, and again pulled off the upset. This time, the Yellow Jackets came from three touchdowns behind and survived a 54-yard FG miss by UVa kicker Todd Braverman as time ran out. Since then, any time the two teams have met with rankings and bowl positions on the line, GT fans have used "41-38" as a rallying cry.</li>
<li><b>Sideways the Dog</b>: Sideways was a black and white female dog, who, after having been involved in a car accident, was forced to walk sideways. She was a favorite of the students, and often slept in a different dorm room every night, being fed through the generosity of the student body and Brittain Dining Hall. She died after accidentally ingesting some rat poison in one of the dorm rooms, and was buried (sideways) on the grounds near Tech Tower. A plaque marks her resting spot and briefly tells her story.</li>
<li><b><a href="/wiki/Drownproofing.html" title="Drownproofing">Drownproofing</a></b>: From 1936 to 1987, Tech offered a class called Drownproofing, which was required for graduation. The class was developed by <b>Coach Fred Lanoue</b> for the Naval School which was located at Georgia Tech prior to and during <a href="/wiki/World_War_II.html" title="World War II">WWII</a>. He taught students how to float in water for extended periods of time with ankles and wrists bound, how (unbound) to swim 50 yards (46 meters) underwater, and other water survival skills. At the time it was considered a prime example of the difficulty of Tech's curriculum, and referred to in jest by students as "Drowning 101".<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a  title="">[8]</a></sup></li>

<h3>Movies</h3>
<p>The Georgia Tech library, the Skiles classroom building, and Tech Square served as locations for the filming of <i><a href="/wiki/One_Missed_Call_%28film%29.html" title="One Missed Call (film)">One Missed Call</a></i> (2007).</p>
<p>The Georgia Tech library was featured as the library at the fictitious Atlanta A&amp;T University in the movie <i><a href="/wiki/Drumline_%28film%29.html" title="Drumline (film)">Drumline</a></i> (2002). Tech is also mentioned by name in the movie, when the only white student at the black university is asked (jokingly) "what's the matter, not enough black kids at Georgia Tech?"</p>
<p>In the movie "Deliverance" starring Jon Voight and Burt Reynolds one of the cars driven by the main charecters has the front license plate that reads "Georgia Tech".</p>
<p>The Georgia Tech football team was portrayed near the end of the 1993 film <i><a href="/wiki/Rudy.html" title="Rudy">Rudy</a></i>, losing 24-3. In a famous scene from the movie, the title character finally gets a chance to play for the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Notre_Dame.html" title="University of Notre Dame">University of Notre Dame</a> as he is put into the ballgame towards the closing moments of the Irish-Yellow Jacket matchup. There are some inaccuracies in the portrayal.</p>
<p>The Georgia Tech <a href="/wiki/Alpha_Tau_Omega.html" title="Alpha Tau Omega">ATÎ©</a> fraternity house was featured in the 1992 film <i><a href="/wiki/Love_Potion_No._9.html" title="Love Potion No. 9">Love Potion No. 9</a></i> starring Tate Donovan and a then largely unknown <a href="/wiki/Sandra_Bullock.html" title="Sandra Bullock">Sandra Bullock</a>.</p>
<p>The Tech campus, especially Rose Bowl Field football practice area and the former Heisman Gym were used in filming the 1984 movie <i><a href="/wiki/The_Bear.html" title="The Bear">The Bear</a></i>, starring <a href="/wiki/Gary_Busey.html" title="Gary Busey">Gary Busey</a> as <a href="/wiki/Bear_Bryant.html" title="Bear Bryant">Paul "Bear" Bryant</a>.</p>
<p>The 1993 <a href="/wiki/Touchstone_Pictures.html" title="Touchstone Pictures">Touchstone Pictures</a> movie <i><a href="/wiki/The_Program.html" title="The Program">The Program</a></i> (starring James Caan as the coach, Omar Epps and Craig Sheffer as players, and Halle Berry and Kristy Swanson as co-eds), features (at the start and near the end) Georgia Tech (in gold helmets with white GT logo, blue and then white jerseys, and gold pants) playing a fictional "ESU" team" (with garnet and gold colors suggesting FSU).</p>
<p>In the movie <i><a href="/wiki/The_Devil%27s_Advocate_%28film%29.html" title="The Devil's Advocate (film)">The Devil's Advocate</a></i> (1997), starring Al Pacino and Keanu Reeves, Pacino tells Reeves that one of the interns on their law firm goes to Georgia Tech.</p>
<p>As mentioned in an earlier section, Gregory Peck played and sang the world-renowned "Ramblin' Wreck" fight song in <i>Man in a Gray Flannel Suit</i> and John Wayne whistled a bit of it in the 1954 movie <i>The High and the Mighty</i> (after convincing the captain to attempt to make it to San Francisco rather than ditch the plane in the ocean). It was no doubt carefully selected as a sign of success, since Georgia Tech was in its glory days of football, winning six bowl games in six years and being named National Champion by organizations in 1951, 1952, and 1956, though Georgia Tech currently only claims to the 1952 season.</p>
<p>Scenes for various other movies have been filmed on the Tech campus, mostly in front of, or in, fraternity houses. Many of the outdoor scenes of the walking tour that sets the stage in the movie <i><a href="/wiki/Road_Trip.html" title="Road Trip">Road Trip</a></i> (2000) were filmed between the Skiles classroom building and the student center, including the Skiles walkway (the Skiles building was incorrectly referred to as a dorm in the movie). Also, one classroom scene was shot inside a large <a  class="external text" title="http://www.oit.gatech.edu/classroom_technology/roomdetails.php?roomid=43">DM Smith</a> lecture hall that was notorious for being one of the most uncomfortable places to attend class on campus.</p>
<p>The movie <i><a href="/wiki/Hyderabad_Blues.html" title="Hyderabad Blues">Hyderabad Blues</a></i> (1998) depicts a graduate student returning home to India to face his parents' proposal of marriage. The student, Nagesh Kukunoor, is seen wearing a Georgia Tech T-shirt. Additionally, Nagesh attended Georgia Tech as a graduate student before becoming a movie producer.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Stevie_Ray_Vaughan.html" title="Stevie Ray Vaughan">Stevie Ray Vaughan</a>'s video for his hit song "The House Is Rockin'" was shot entirely inside the <a href="/wiki/Chi_Phi.html" title="Chi Phi">Chi Phi</a> fraternity house at Georgia Tech during the summer of 1990. It would be Vaughan's last music video before he died in a helicopter crash later that year.</p>

<h3>Music</h3>
<p>In the <a href="/wiki/Field_Mob.html" title="Field Mob">Field Mob</a> (featuring <a href="/wiki/Ludacris.html" title="Ludacris">Ludacris</a> and <a href="/wiki/Jamie_Foxx.html" title="Jamie Foxx">Jamie Foxx</a>) song, <a href="/wiki/Georgia_%28song%29.html" title="Georgia (song)">Georgia</a>, Georgia Tech is mentioned in the lyric: "That's why I keep my Georgia Tech in the state of / Georgia". In keeping with the rest of the song, the reference is a <a href="/wiki/Double_entendre.html" title="Double entendre">double entendre</a>, the secondary meaning in this case being a <a href="/wiki/Intratec_TEC-DC9.html" title="Intratec TEC-DC9">TEC 9</a> gun.</p>
