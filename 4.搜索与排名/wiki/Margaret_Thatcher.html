Roberts came from a <a href="/wiki/Liberal_Party_%28UK%29.html" title="Liberal Party (UK)">Liberal</a> family but stood—as was then customary in local government—as an Independent. He lost his post as Alderman in 1952 after the <a href="/wiki/Labour_Party_%28UK%29.html" title="Labour Party (UK)">Labour Party</a> won its first majority on Grantham Council in 1950.

<p>At the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election%2C_1950.html" title="United Kingdom general election, 1950">1950</a> and <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election%2C_1951.html" title="United Kingdom general election, 1951">1951</a> elections, Margaret Roberts fought the <a href="/wiki/Safe_seat.html" title="Safe seat">safe</a> Labour seat of <a href="/wiki/Dartford_%28UK_Parliament_constituency%29.html" title="Dartford (UK Parliament constituency)">Dartford</a>, and was the youngest woman Conservative candidate. Her activity in the Conservative Party in <a href="/wiki/Kent.html" title="Kent">Kent</a> brought her into contact with Sir <a href="/wiki/Denis_Thatcher.html" title="Denis Thatcher">Denis Thatcher</a>, whom she married in 1951. Denis was a wealthy businessman and he funded his wife's studies for the <a href="/wiki/Barrister.html" title="Barrister">Bar</a>. She qualified as a barrister in 1953, the same year that her twin children <a href="/wiki/Carol_Thatcher.html" title="Carol Thatcher">Carol</a> and <a href="/wiki/Mark_Thatcher.html" title="Mark Thatcher">Mark</a> were born. As a lawyer she specialised in tax law.</p>
<p>Thatcher had begun to look for a safe Conservative seat and was narrowly rejected as candidate for <a href="/wiki/Orpington_%28UK_Parliament_constituency%29.html" title="Orpington (UK Parliament constituency)">Orpington</a> in 1954. She had several other rejections before being selected for <a href="/wiki/Finchley_%28UK_Parliament_constituency%29.html" title="Finchley (UK Parliament constituency)">Finchley</a> in April 1958. She won the seat easily in the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election%2C_1959.html" title="United Kingdom general election, 1959">1959 election</a> and took her seat in the <a href="/wiki/British_House_of_Commons.html" title="British House of Commons">House of Commons</a>. Unusually, her <a href="/wiki/Maiden_speech.html" title="Maiden speech">maiden speech</a> was in support of her <a href="/wiki/Private_Member%27s_Bill.html" title="Private Member's Bill">Private Member's Bill</a> (<a href="/wiki/Public_Bodies_%28Admission_to_Meetings%29_Act_1960.html" title="Public Bodies (Admission to Meetings) Act 1960">Public Bodies (Admission to Meetings) Act 1960</a>) to force local councils to hold meetings in public, which was successful. In 1961 she voted against her party's line by voting for the restoration of <a href="/wiki/Birching.html" title="Birching">birching</a>.</p>
<p>She was given early promotion to the front bench as <a href="/wiki/Parliamentary_Secretary.html" title="Parliamentary Secretary">Parliamentary Secretary</a> at the <a href="/wiki/Secretary_of_State_for_Work_and_Pensions.html" title="Secretary of State for Work and Pensions">Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance</a> in September 1961, keeping the post until the Conservatives lost power in the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election%2C_1964.html" title="United Kingdom general election, 1964">1964 election</a>. When Sir <a href="/wiki/Alec_Douglas-Home.html" title="Alec Douglas-Home">Alec Douglas-Home</a> stepped down Thatcher voted for <a href="/wiki/Edward_Heath.html" title="Edward Heath">Edward Heath</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Conservative_Party_%28UK%29_leadership_election%2C_1965.html" title="Conservative Party (UK) leadership election, 1965">leadership election</a> over <a href="/wiki/Reginald_Maudling.html" title="Reginald Maudling">Reginald Maudling</a>, and was rewarded with the job of Conservative spokesman on Housing and Land. She moved to the Shadow <a href="/wiki/HM_Treasury.html" title="HM Treasury">Treasury</a> Team after 1966.</p>
<p>Thatcher was one of few Conservative MPs to support <a href="/wiki/Leo_Abse.html" title="Leo Abse">Leo Abse</a>'s Bill to decriminalise male <a href="/wiki/Homosexuality.html" title="Homosexuality">homosexuality</a>, and she voted in favour of <a href="/wiki/David_Steel.html" title="David Steel">David Steel</a>'s Bill to legalise <a href="/wiki/Abortion.html" title="Abortion">abortion</a>. However, she was opposed to the abolition of <a href="/wiki/Capital_punishment.html" title="Capital punishment">capital punishment</a> and voted against making <a href="/wiki/Divorce.html" title="Divorce">divorce</a> more easily attainable. She made her mark as a conference speaker, in 1966, with a strong attack on the taxation policy of the Labour Government as being steps "not only towards <a href="/wiki/Socialism.html" title="Socialism">Socialism</a>, but towards <a href="/wiki/Communism.html" title="Communism">Communism</a>". She won promotion to the <a href="/wiki/Shadow_Cabinet.html" title="Shadow Cabinet">Shadow Cabinet</a> as Shadow Fuel Spokesman in 1967, and was then promoted to shadow Transport and, finally, Education before the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election%2C_1970.html" title="United Kingdom general election, 1970">1970 election</a>.</p>

<h2>In Heath's Cabinet</h2>
<p>When the Conservatives won the 1970 general election, Thatcher became <a href="/wiki/Secretary_of_State_for_Education_and_Skills.html" title="Secretary of State for Education and Skills">Secretary of State for Education and Science</a>. In her first months in office, forced to administer a cut in the Education budget, she was responsible for the abolition of universal free milk for school-children aged seven to eleven (Labour had already abolished it for secondary schools). This led to one of the more unflattering names for her, "Thatcher Thatcher, Milk Snatcher". Recently released Cabinet papers show that she spoke against the move in Cabinet, but was forced, due to the concept of collective responsibility, to implement the will of her fellow ministers.<a  class="external autonumber" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_depth/uk/2000/uk_confidential/1095121.stm">[2]</a> This provoked a storm of public protest. She also successfully resisted library book charges.</p>
<p>Her term was marked by many proposals for more local education authorities to abolish <a href="/wiki/Grammar_schools_in_the_United_Kingdom.html" title="Grammar schools in the United Kingdom">grammar schools</a>, of which she approved, and adopt <a href="/wiki/Comprehensive_school.html" title="Comprehensive school">comprehensive secondary education</a>, even though this was widely perceived as a left-wing policy. Thatcher also saved the <a href="/wiki/Open_University.html" title="Open University">Open University</a> from being abolished. The Chancellor Iain Macleod wanted to abolish it to save money and he viewed it as a gimmick by Harold Wilson. Thatcher believed it was a relatively cheap way of extending opportunities to adults who had missed out on university education when they were younger.</p>
<p>After the Conservative defeat in <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election%2C_February_1974.html" title="United Kingdom general election, February 1974">February 1974</a>, she was promoted again, to Shadow Environment Secretary. In this job she promised to abolish the <a href="/wiki/Poll_tax#United_Kingdom.html" title="Poll tax">rating system</a> that paid for local government services, which proved a popular policy within the Conservative Party.</p>
<p>She agreed with Sir <a href="/wiki/Keith_Joseph.html" title="Keith Joseph">Keith Joseph</a> that the Heath Government had lost control of <a href="/wiki/Monetary_policy.html" title="Monetary policy">monetary policy</a>. After Heath lost the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election%2C_October_1974.html" title="United Kingdom general election, October 1974">second election that year</a>, Joseph decided to challenge his leadership but later dropped out. Thatcher then decided that she would enter <a href="/wiki/Conservative_Party_%28UK%29_leadership_election%2C_1975.html" title="Conservative Party (UK) leadership election, 1975">the race</a>. Unexpectedly she outpolled Heath on the first ballot and won the job on the second, on 11th February 1975. She appointed Heath's preferred successor <a href="/wiki/William_Whitelaw.html" title="William Whitelaw">William Whitelaw</a> as her deputy.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: As Leader of the Opposition">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="As_Leader_of_the_Opposition" id="As_Leader_of_the_Opposition"></a></p>
<h2>As Leader of the Opposition</h2>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/January_19.html" title="January 19">19 January</a> <a href="/wiki/1976.html" title="1976">1976</a>, she made a speech in <a href="/wiki/Kensington.html" title="Kensington">Kensington</a> Town Hall in which she made a scathing attack on the <a href="/wiki/Soviet_Union.html" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a>. The most famous part of her speech ran:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The Russians are bent on world dominance, and they are rapidly acquiring the means to become the most powerful imperial nation the world has seen. The men in the Soviet <i>Politburo</i> do not have to worry about the ebb and flow of public opinion. <a href="/wiki/Guns_versus_butter_model.html" title="Guns versus butter model">They put guns before butter</a>, while we put just about everything before guns."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In response, the Soviet Defence Ministry newspaper <i><a href="/wiki/Krasnaya_Zvezda.html" title="Krasnaya Zvezda">Krasnaya Zvezda</a></i> (<i>"<a href="/wiki/Red_Star.html" title="Red Star">Red Star</a>"</i>) gave her the nickname "<a href="/wiki/Iron_Lady.html" title="Iron Lady">Iron Lady</a>", which was soon publicised by <a href="/wiki/Radio_Moscow.html" title="Radio Moscow">Radio Moscow</a> world service. She took delight in the name and it soon became associated with her image as an unwavering and steadfast character.</p>
<p>She appointed many Heath supporters in the Shadow Cabinet and throughout her administrations sought to have a cabinet that reflected the broad range of opinions in the Conservative Party. Thatcher had to act cautiously to convert the Conservative Party to her <a href="/wiki/Monetarist.html" title="Monetarist">monetarist</a> beliefs. She reversed Heath's support for <a href="/wiki/Devolved_government.html" title="Devolved government">devolved government</a> for <a href="/wiki/Scotland.html" title="Scotland">Scotland</a>.

<p>During the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election%2C_1979.html" title="United Kingdom general election, 1979">1979 General Election</a>, most opinion polls showed that voters preferred <a href="/wiki/James_Callaghan.html" title="James Callaghan">James Callaghan</a> as Prime Minister even as the Conservative Party maintained a lead in the polls.

<h3>1979–1983</h3>
<p>Thatcher formed a government on <a href="/wiki/May_4.html" title="May 4">4 May</a> <a href="/wiki/1979.html" title="1979">1979</a>, with a mandate to reverse the UK's economic decline and to reduce the role of the state in the economy. Thatcher was incensed by one contemporary view within the <a href="/wiki/Civil_Service.html" title="Civil Service">Civil Service</a> that its job was to manage the UK's decline from the days of <a href="/wiki/British_Empire.html" title="British Empire">Empire</a>, and wanted the country to assert a higher level of influence and leadership in <a href="/wiki/International_relations.html" title="International relations">international affairs</a>. She was a <a href="/wiki/Philosophy.html" title="Philosophy">philosophic</a> soulmate of <a href="/wiki/Ronald_Reagan.html" title="Ronald Reagan">Ronald Reagan</a>, elected in 1980 in the <a href="/wiki/United_States.html" title="United States">United States</a>, and to a lesser extent <a href="/wiki/Brian_Mulroney.html" title="Brian Mulroney">Brian Mulroney</a>, who was elected in 1984 in <a href="/wiki/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canada</a>. It seemed for a time that conservatism might be the dominant political philosophy in the major English-speaking nations for the era.</p>
<p>In May 1980, one day before she was due to meet the <a href="/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland.html" title="Republic of Ireland">Irish</a> <a href="/wiki/Taoiseach.html" title="Taoiseach">Taoiseach</a>, <a href="/wiki/Charles_Haughey.html" title="Charles Haughey">Charles Haughey</a> to discuss <a href="/wiki/Northern_Ireland.html" title="Northern Ireland">Northern Ireland</a>, she announced in the <a href="/wiki/British_House_of_Commons.html" title="British House of Commons">House of Commons</a> that "the future of the constitutional affairs of <a href="/wiki/Northern_Ireland.html" title="Northern Ireland">Northern Ireland</a> is a matter for the people of Northern Ireland, this government, this parliament <i>and no-one else</i>."</p>
<p>In 1981, a number of <a href="/wiki/Provisional_Irish_Republican_Army.html" title="Provisional Irish Republican Army">Provisional Irish Republican Army</a> (IRA) and <a href="/wiki/Irish_National_Liberation_Army.html" title="Irish National Liberation Army">Irish National Liberation Army</a> prisoners in <a href="/wiki/Northern_Ireland.html" title="Northern Ireland">Northern Ireland</a>'s <a href="/wiki/Maze_%28HM_Prison%29.html" title="Maze (HM Prison)">Maze</a> prison (known in Ireland as 'Long Kesh', its previous name) went on <a href="/wiki/1981_Irish_Hunger_Strike.html" title="1981 Irish Hunger Strike">hunger strike</a> to regain the status of <a href="/wiki/Political_prisoners.html" title="Political prisoners">political prisoners</a>, which had been revoked five years earlier. <a href="/wiki/Bobby_Sands.html" title="Bobby Sands">Bobby Sands</a>, the first of the strikers, was elected as a <a href="/wiki/Member_of_Parliament.html" title="Member of Parliament">Member of Parliament</a> (MP) for the constituency of <a href="/wiki/Fermanagh_and_South_Tyrone_%28UK_Parliament_constituency%29.html" title="Fermanagh and South Tyrone (UK Parliament constituency)">Fermanagh and South Tyrone</a> a few weeks before he died.</p>
<p>Thatcher refused at first to countenance a return to political status for republican prisoners, famously declaring "Crime is crime is crime; it is not political." However, after nine more men had starved themselves to death and the strike had ended, and in the face of growing anger on both sides of the border and widespread civil unrest, some rights offered to paramilitary prisoners under political status were restored.</p>
<p>Thatcher also continued the policy of "<a href="/wiki/Ulsterisation.html" title="Ulsterisation">Ulsterisation</a>" of the previous Labour government and its <a href="/wiki/Secretary_of_State_for_Northern_Ireland.html" title="Secretary of State for Northern Ireland">Secretary of State for Northern Ireland</a>, <a href="/wiki/Roy_Mason.html" title="Roy Mason">Roy Mason</a>, believing that the <a href="/wiki/Unionists.html" title="Unionists">unionists</a> of Northern Ireland should be at the forefront in combating <a href="/wiki/Irish_republicanism.html" title="Irish republicanism">Irish republicanism</a>. This meant relieving the burden on the mainstream <a href="/wiki/British_army.html" title="British army">British army</a> and elevating the role of the <a href="/wiki/Ulster_Defence_Regiment.html" title="Ulster Defence Regiment">Ulster Defence Regiment</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Royal_Ulster_Constabulary.html" title="Royal Ulster Constabulary">Royal Ulster Constabulary</a>.</p>
<p>In economic policy, Thatcher started out by increasing interest rates to drive down the money supply. She had a preference for indirect taxation over taxes on income, and <a href="/wiki/Value_added_tax.html" title="Value added tax">value added tax</a> (VAT) was raised sharply to 15%, with a resultant rise in inflation. These moves hit businesses, especially in the manufacturing sector, and unemployment quickly passed two million people, doubling the one million unemployed she inherited from Labour.</p>
<p>Political commentators harked back to the Heath Government's "U-turn" and speculated that Mrs Thatcher would follow suit, but she repudiated this approach at the 1980 Conservative Party conference, telling the party: "To those waiting with bated breath for that favourite media catch-phrase—the U-turn—I have only one thing to say: you turn if you want to; the Lady's not for turning". That she meant what she said was confirmed in the 1981 budget, when, despite concerns expressed in an open letter from 364 leading economists, taxes were increased in the middle of a recession. In January 1982, the inflation rate dropped to single figures and <a href="/wiki/Interest_rate.html" title="Interest rate">interest rates</a> were then allowed to fall. Unemployment continued to rise, reaching an official figure of 3.6 million — although the criteria for defining who was unemployed were amended allowing some to estimate that unemployment in fact hit 5 million. However, <a href="/wiki/Norman_Tebbit.html" title="Norman Tebbit">Lord Tebbit</a> has suggested that, due to the high number of people claiming unemployment benefit whilst working, he doubts whether unemployment ever reached three million at all.</p>
<p>By 1983, manufacturing output had dropped 30% from 1978.</p>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/Argentina.html" title="Argentina">Argentina</a>, an unstable military junta was in power and keen on reversing its widespread unpopularity caused by the country's poor economic performance. On <a href="/wiki/April_2.html" title="April 2">2 April</a> <a href="/wiki/1982.html" title="1982">1982</a>, it invaded the <a href="/wiki/Falkland_Islands.html" title="Falkland Islands">Falkland Islands</a>, known to the Argentinians as Islas Malvinas, the only invasion of a British territory since <a href="/wiki/World_War_II.html" title="World War II">World War II</a>. Argentina has <a href="/wiki/History_of_the_Falkland_Islands.html" title="History of the Falkland Islands">claimed the islands</a> since an 1830s dispute on their settlement. Within days, Thatcher sent a naval <a href="/wiki/Task_force.html" title="Task force">task force</a> to recapture the Islands, which was successful, resulting in a wave of <a href="/wiki/Patriotism.html" title="Patriotism">patriotic</a> enthusiasm for her, personally, at a time when her popularity had been at an all-time low for a serving Prime Minister.<sup title="The text in the vicinity of this tag needs citation." class="noprint">[<a  title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><i>citation&#160;needed</i></a>]</sup> (<i>See: <a href="/wiki/Falklands_War.html" title="Falklands War">Falklands War</a></i>)</p>

<p>This "Falklands Factor," along with disunity in the opposition was a major factor in the large Conservative majority in the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election%2C_1983.html" title="United Kingdom general election, 1983">June 1983 general election</a>, a political high point for the Thatcher government. Signs of economic recovery in early 1983 also aided the government's cause.</p>
<p>Aiming to take advantage of the Labour split, there was a new challenge to the political centre, the <a href="/wiki/SDP-Liberal_Alliance.html" title="SDP-Liberal Alliance">SDP-Liberal Alliance</a>, formed by an electoral pact between the SDP and the <a href="/wiki/Liberal_Party_%28UK%29.html" title="Liberal Party (UK)">Liberal Party</a>, aiming to break the major parties' dominance and win <a href="/wiki/Proportional_representation.html" title="Proportional representation">proportional representation</a>. However, this grouping of uncertain cohesion failed to make its intended breakthrough. The Conservatives won 42.4% of the vote, a slightly smaller share of the vote than in the 1979 general election. However, the split opposition, combined with Britain's <a href="/wiki/First_past_the_post.html" title="First past the post">first past the post</a> electoral system—in which marginal changes in vote numbers and distribution often have disproportionate effects on the number of seats won — translated this vote share into a Conservative <a href="/wiki/Landslide.html" title="Landslide">landslide</a>. Margaret Thatcher had won with a majority of 144 over the other parties.</p>

<h3>1983–1987</h3>
<p>Thatcher was committed to reducing the power of the <a href="/wiki/Trade_union.html" title="Trade union">trade unions</a> but, unlike the Heath government, adopted a strategy of incremental change rather than a single Act. Several unions launched <a href="/wiki/Strike_action.html" title="Strike action">strikes</a> that were wholly or partly aimed at damaging her politically. The most significant of these was carried out, in 1984-85, by the <a href="/wiki/National_Union_of_Mineworkers.html" title="National Union of Mineworkers">National Union of Mineworkers</a> (NUM). Thatcher had made preparations long in advance for an NUM strike by building up <a href="/wiki/Coal.html" title="Coal">coal</a> stocks, and there were no cuts in <a href="/wiki/Electricity.html" title="Electricity">electricity</a> supply, unlike 1972. <a href="/wiki/Police.html" title="Police">Police</a> tactics during the strike concerned <a href="/wiki/Civil_liberties.html" title="Civil liberties">civil libertarians</a>, but images of crowds of militant miners using violence to prevent other miners from working swung public opinion against the strike. The <a href="/wiki/UK_miners%27_strike_%281984-1985%29.html" title="UK miners' strike (1984-1985)">Miners' Strike</a> lasted a full year before the NUM leadership conceded without a deal. The Conservative government then went on to close all but 15 pits, before privatisation in 1994.</p>
<p>Following the arrest of the <a href="/wiki/Coventry_Four.html" title="Coventry Four">Coventry Four</a> for breaching the UN arms embargo against <a href="/wiki/History_of_South_Africa_in_the_apartheid_era.html" title="History of South Africa in the apartheid era">apartheid South Africa</a> in March 1984, and their repatriation to South Africa on bail, Thatcher invited <a href="/wiki/History_of_South_Africa_in_the_apartheid_era.html" title="History of South Africa in the apartheid era">apartheid South Africa</a>'s president, <a href="/wiki/P.W._Botha.html" title="P.W. Botha">P.W. Botha</a>, and foreign minister, <a href="/wiki/Pik_Botha.html" title="Pik Botha">Pik Botha</a>, to <a href="/wiki/Chequers.html" title="Chequers">Chequers</a> in an effort to stave off growing international pressure for the imposition of <a href="/wiki/Economic_sanctions.html" title="Economic sanctions">economic sanctions</a> against South Africa, where Britain had invested heavily. She reportedly urged President Botha to end apartheid; to release <a href="/wiki/Nelson_Mandela.html" title="Nelson Mandela">Nelson Mandela</a>; to halt the harassment of black dissidents; to stop the bombing of <a href="/wiki/African_National_Congress.html" title="African National Congress">ANC</a> bases in front-line states; and to comply with UN Security Council resolutions and withdraw from <a href="/wiki/Namibia.html" title="Namibia">Namibia</a>.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a  title="">[2]</a></sup> However Botha ignored these demands. In an interview with <a href="/wiki/Hugo_Young.html" title="Hugo Young">Hugo Young</a> for <i>The Guardian</i> in July 1986, Thatcher expressed her belief that economic sanctions against South Africa would be immoral because they would make thousands of black workers unemployed.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a  title="">[3]</a></sup> Because Pik Botha refused to allow the Coventry Four to return to England for their trial in the autumn of 1984, the £200,000 bail money had to be surrendered to the High Court.</p>
<p>On the early morning of <a href="/wiki/October_12.html" title="October 12">October 12</a>, <a href="/wiki/1984.html" title="1984">1984</a>, the day before her 59th birthday, Thatcher escaped injury in the <a href="/wiki/Brighton_hotel_bombing.html" title="Brighton hotel bombing">Brighton hotel bombing</a> when the hotel she was staying in for the Conservative Party Conference was bombed by the Provisional Irish Republican Army. Five people died in the attack, including Roberta Wakeham, wife of the government's <a href="/wiki/Chief_Whip.html" title="Chief Whip">Chief Whip</a> <a href="/wiki/John_Wakeham%2C_Baron_Wakeham.html" title="John Wakeham, Baron Wakeham">John Wakeham</a>, and the Conservative <a href="/wiki/Member_of_Parliament.html" title="Member of Parliament">MP</a> <a href="/wiki/Anthony_Berry.html" title="Anthony Berry">Sir Anthony Berry</a>. A prominent member of the Cabinet, <a href="/wiki/Norman_Tebbit.html" title="Norman Tebbit">Norman Tebbit</a>, was injured, along with his wife Margaret, who was left paralysed. Thatcher herself would have been injured if not for the fact that she was delayed from using the bathroom (which suffered more damage than the room she was in at the time the IRA bomb detonated).<a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.margaretthatcher.org/speeches/displaydocument.asp?docid=109119">[5]</a> Thatcher insisted that the conference open on time the next day and made her speech as planned in defiance of the bombers, a gesture which won widespread approval across the political spectrum.</p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/November_15.html" title="November 15">November 15</a>, <a href="/wiki/1985.html" title="1985">1985</a>, Thatcher signed the Hillsborough <a href="/wiki/Anglo-Irish_Agreement.html" title="Anglo-Irish Agreement">Anglo-Irish Agreement</a> with Irish Prime Minister <a href="/wiki/Garret_FitzGerald.html" title="Garret FitzGerald">Garret FitzGerald</a>, the first time a British government gave the Republic of Ireland a say (albeit advisory) in the governance of Northern Ireland. The agreement was greeted with fury by Northern Irish unionists. The <a href="/wiki/Ulster_Unionist_Party.html" title="Ulster Unionist Party">Ulster Unionists</a> and <a href="/wiki/Democratic_Unionist_Party.html" title="Democratic Unionist Party">Democratic Unionists</a> made an electoral pact and on <a href="/wiki/January_23.html" title="January 23">January 23</a>, <a href="/wiki/1986.html" title="1986">1986</a>, staged an ad-hoc referendum by resigning their seats and contesting the subsequent by-elections, losing only one, to the nationalist <a href="/wiki/Social_Democratic_and_Labour_Party.html" title="Social Democratic and Labour Party">SDLP</a>. However, unlike the <a href="/wiki/Sunningdale_Agreement.html" title="Sunningdale Agreement">Sunningdale Agreement</a> of 1974, they found they could not bring the agreement down by a general strike. This was another effect of the changed balance of power in <a href="/wiki/Industrial_relations.html" title="Industrial relations">industrial relations</a>.</p>
<p>Thatcher's political and economic philosophy emphasised <a href="/wiki/Free_market.html" title="Free market">free markets</a> and <a href="/wiki/Entrepreneur.html" title="Entrepreneur">entrepreneurialism</a>. Since gaining power, she had experimented in selling off a small <a href="/wiki/Nationalization.html" title="Nationalization">nationalised</a> company, the National Freight Company, to its workers, with a surprisingly positive response. After the 1983 election, the Government became bolder and, starting with <a href="/wiki/British_Telecom.html" title="British Telecom">British Telecom</a>, sold off most of the large utilities which had been in public ownership since the late 1940s. Many in the public took advantage of <a href="/wiki/Stock.html" title="Stock">share</a> offers, although many sold their shares immediately for a quick profit. The policy of <a href="/wiki/Privatization.html" title="Privatization">privatisation</a>, while anathema to many on the left, has become synonymous with <a href="/wiki/Thatcherism.html" title="Thatcherism">Thatcherism</a>. Wider share-ownership and council house sales became known as "<a  class="new" title="Popular capitalism">popular capitalism</a>" to its supporters.</p>
<p>In the <a href="/wiki/Cold_War.html" title="Cold War">Cold War</a>, Mrs Thatcher supported <a href="/wiki/Ronald_Reagan.html" title="Ronald Reagan">Ronald Reagan</a>'s policies of <a href="/wiki/Deterrence.html" title="Deterrence">deterrence</a> against the Soviets. This contrasted with the policy of <i><a href="/wiki/D%C3%A9tente.html" title="Détente">détente</a></i> which the West had pursued during the 1970s, and caused friction with allies who still adhered to the idea of <i>détente</i>. <a href="/wiki/United_States.html" title="United States">US</a> forces were permitted by Mrs. Thatcher to station nuclear <a href="/wiki/Cruise_missile.html" title="Cruise missile">cruise missiles</a> at British bases, arousing mass protests by the <a href="/wiki/Campaign_for_Nuclear_Disarmament.html" title="Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament">Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament</a>. However, she later was the first Western leader to respond warmly to the rise of reformist Soviet leader <a href="/wiki/Mikhail_Gorbachev.html" title="Mikhail Gorbachev">Mikhail Gorbachev</a>, declaring that she liked him and describing him as "a man we can do business with" after a meeting in 1984, three months before he came to power. This was a start of a move by the West back to a new <i>détente</i> with the USSR under Gorbachev's leadership which coincided with the final erosion of Soviet power prior to the turbulence of 1991 and the collapse of the Union. Thatcher outlasted the Cold War, which ended in 1989, and voices who share her views on it credit her with a part in the West's victory, by both the deterrence and <i>détente</i> postures.</p>
<p>Also in 1985, as a deliberate snub, the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Oxford.html" title="University of Oxford">University of Oxford</a> voted to refuse her an honorary degree in protest against her cuts in funding for education. <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/low/dates/stories/january/29/newsid_2506000/2506019.stm">[6]</a> This award had always previously been given to Prime Ministers that had been educated at Oxford.</p>
<p>She supported the <a href="/wiki/Operation_El_Dorado_Canyon.html" title="Operation El Dorado Canyon">US bombing raid on Libya</a> from bases in the UK in 1986 in defiance of other <a href="/wiki/NATO.html" title="NATO">NATO</a> allies. Her liking for defence ties with the United States was demonstrated in the <a href="/wiki/Westland_affair.html" title="Westland affair">Westland affair</a> when she acted with colleagues to allow the helicopter manufacturer <a href="/wiki/Westland.html" title="Westland">Westland</a>, a vital defence contractor, to refuse to link with the Italian firm <a href="/wiki/Agusta.html" title="Agusta">Agusta</a> in order for it to link with the management's preferred option, <a href="/wiki/Sikorsky_Aircraft_Corporation.html" title="Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation">Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation</a> of the United States. <a href="/wiki/Secretary_of_State_for_Defence.html" title="Secretary of State for Defence">Defence Secretary</a> <a href="/wiki/Michael_Heseltine.html" title="Michael Heseltine">Michael Heseltine</a>, who had pushed the Agusta deal, resigned in protest at her style of leadership, and remained an influential critic and potential leadership challenger. He would, eventually, prove instrumental in Thatcher's fall in 1990.</p>
<p>In 1986, her government controversially abolished the <a href="/wiki/Greater_London_Council.html" title="Greater London Council">Greater London Council</a> (GLC), then led by radical left-winger <a href="/wiki/Ken_Livingstone.html" title="Ken Livingstone">Ken Livingstone</a>, and six <a href="/wiki/Metropolitan_county.html" title="Metropolitan county">Metropolitan County Councils</a> (MCCs). The government claimed this was an efficiency measure. However, Thatcher's opponents held that the move was politically motivated, as all of the abolished councils were controlled by Labour, had become powerful centres of opposition to her government, and were in favour of higher public spending by local government.</p>
<p>Thatcher had two noted foreign policy successes in her second term.</p>
<ul>
<li>In 1984, she visited China and signed the <a href="/wiki/Sino-British_Joint_Declaration.html" title="Sino-British Joint Declaration">Sino-British Joint Declaration</a> with <a href="/wiki/Deng_Xiaoping.html" title="Deng Xiaoping">Deng Xiaoping</a> on <a href="/wiki/December_19.html" title="December 19">19 December</a>, which committed the <a href="/wiki/People%27s_Republic_of_China.html" title="People's Republic of China">People's Republic of China</a> to award <a href="/wiki/Hong_Kong.html" title="Hong Kong">Hong Kong</a> the status of a "Special Administrative Region". Under the terms of the so-called <a href="/wiki/One_Country%2C_Two_Systems.html" title="One Country, Two Systems">One Country, Two Systems</a> agreement, China was obliged to leave Hong Kong's economic status unchanged after the handover on <a href="/wiki/July_1.html" title="July 1">July 1</a>, <a href="/wiki/1997.html" title="1997">1997</a> for a period of fifty years – until 2047.</li>
<li>At the Dublin European Council in November 1979, Mrs Thatcher argued that the United Kingdom paid far more to the <a href="/wiki/European_Economic_Community.html" title="European Economic Community">European Economic Community</a> than it received in spending. She famously declared at the summit: "We are not asking the Community or anyone else for money. We are simply asking to have our own money back". Her arguments were successful and at the June 1984 Fontainbleau Summit, the EEC agreed on an annual rebate for the United Kingdom, amounting to 66% of the difference between Britain's EU contributions and receipts. This still remains in effect and occasionally causes some political controversy among the members of the <a href="/wiki/European_Union.html" title="European Union">European Union</a>.</li>

Her unpopularity on the left is evident from the lyrics of several contemporary popular songs: "Stand Down Margaret" (<a href="/wiki/The_Beat.html" title="The Beat">The Beat</a>), "Tramp The Dirt Down" (<a href="/wiki/Elvis_Costello.html" title="Elvis Costello">Elvis Costello</a>), "Margaret On The Guillotine" (<a href="/wiki/Morrissey.html" title="Morrissey">Morrissey</a>) and "Mother Knows Best" (<a href="/wiki/Richard_Thompson.html" title="Richard Thompson">Richard Thompson</a>).</p>
<p>Though an early backer of decriminalization of male homosexuality (see above), Thatcher, at the 1987 Conservative party conference, issued the statement that "Children who need to be taught to respect traditional moral values are being taught that they have an inalienable right to be gay". Backbench Conservative MPs and Peers had already begun a backlash against the 'promotion' of homosexuality and, in December 1987, the controversial '<a href="/wiki/Section_28.html" title="Section 28">Section 28</a>' was added as an amendment to what became the <a href="/wiki/Local_Government_Act_1988.html" title="Local Government Act 1988">Local Government Act 1988</a>. This legislation has since been abolished.</p>
<p>Welfare reforms in her third term created an adult Employment Training system that included full-time work done for the dole plus a £10 top-up, on the <a href="/wiki/Workfare.html" title="Workfare">workfare</a> model from the <a href="/wiki/United_States_of_America.html" title="United States of America">US</a>.</p>
<p>In the late 1980s, Thatcher, a former chemist, became concerned with environmental issues, which she had previously dismissed<sup title="The text in the vicinity of this tag needs citation." class="noprint">[<a  title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><i>citation&#160;needed</i></a>]</sup>. In 1988, she made <a  class="external text" title="http://www.margaretthatcher.org/speeches/displaydocument.asp?docid=107346">a major speech</a> accepting the problems of <a href="/wiki/Global_warming.html" title="Global warming">global warming</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ozone_depletion.html" title="Ozone depletion">ozone depletion</a> and <a href="/wiki/Acid_rain.html" title="Acid rain">acid rain</a>. In 1990, she opened the <a href="/wiki/Hadley_Centre.html" title="Hadley Centre">Hadley Centre</a> for climate prediction and research. <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.margaretthatcher.org/Speeches/displaydocument.asp?docid=108102&amp;doctype=1">[7]</a>. In her book <i>Statecraft</i> (2002), she described her later regret in supporting the concept of human-induced global warming, outlining the negative effects she perceived it had upon the policy-making process. "Whatever international action we agree upon to deal with environmental problems, we must enable our economies to grow and develop, because without growth you cannot generate the wealth required to pay for the protection of the environment" (452).</p>
<p>At <a href="/wiki/Bruges%2C_Belgium.html" title="Bruges, Belgium">Bruges, Belgium</a>, in 1988, Thatcher made a speech in which she outlined her opposition to proposals from the <a href="/wiki/European_Union.html" title="European Union">European Community</a> for a federal structure and increasing centralisation of decision-making. Although she had supported British membership, Thatcher believed that the role of the EC should be limited to ensuring free trade and effective competition, and feared that new EC regulations would reverse the changes she was making in the UK. "We have not successfully rolled back the frontiers of the state in Britain, only to see them re-imposed at a European level, with a European super-state exercising a new dominance from Brussels". She was specifically against <a href="/wiki/Economic_and_Monetary_Union_of_the_European_Union.html" title="Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union">Economic and Monetary Union</a>, through which a single currency would replace national currencies, and for which the EC was making preparations. The speech caused an outcry from other European leaders, and exposed for the first time the deep split that was emerging over European policy inside her Conservative Party.</p>
<p>Thatcher's popularity once again declined, in 1989, as the economy suffered from high interest rates imposed to stop an unsustainable <a href="/wiki/Boom_and_bust.html" title="Boom and bust">boom</a>. She blamed her Chancellor, <a href="/wiki/Nigel_Lawson.html" title="Nigel Lawson">Nigel Lawson</a>, who had been following an economic policy which was a preparation for monetary union; in an interview for the <i>Financial Times</i>, in November 1987, Thatcher claimed not to have been told of this and did not approve.<a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.margaretthatcher.org/speeches/displaydocument.asp?docid=106969">[8]</a></p>
<p>At a meeting before the <a href="/wiki/Madrid.html" title="Madrid">Madrid</a> European Community summit in June 1989, Lawson and Foreign Secretary <a href="/wiki/Geoffrey_Howe.html" title="Geoffrey Howe">Geoffrey Howe</a> forced Thatcher to agree the circumstances under which she would join the <a href="/wiki/Exchange_Rate_Mechanism.html" title="Exchange Rate Mechanism">Exchange Rate Mechanism</a>, a preparation for monetary union. At the meeting, they both claimed they would resign if their demands were not agreed to by Thatcher.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a  title="">[4]</a></sup> Thatcher took revenge on both by demoting Howe and by listening more to her adviser Sir <a href="/wiki/Alan_Walters.html" title="Alan Walters">Alan Walters</a> on economic matters. Lawson resigned that October, feeling that Thatcher had undermined him.<sup title="The text in the vicinity of this tag needs citation." class="noprint">[<a  title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><i>citation&#160;needed</i></a>]</sup></p>
<p>That November, Thatcher was <a href="/wiki/Conservative_Party_%28UK%29_leadership_election%2C_1989.html" title="Conservative Party (UK) leadership election, 1989">challenged for the leadership</a> of the Conservative Party by Sir <a href="/wiki/Anthony_Meyer.html" title="Anthony Meyer">Anthony Meyer</a>. As Meyer was a virtually unknown <a href="/wiki/Backbencher.html" title="Backbencher">backbench</a> MP, he was viewed as a <a href="/wiki/Stalking_horse.html" title="Stalking horse">stalking horse</a> candidate for more prominent members of the party. Thatcher easily defeated Meyer's challenge, but there were sixty ballot papers either cast for Meyer or abstaining, a surprisingly large number for a sitting Prime Minister. Her supporters in the Party, however, viewed the results as a success, claiming that after ten years as Prime Minister and with approximately 370 Conservative MPs voting, the opposition was surprisingly small.<a  class="external autonumber" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/december/5/newsid_2528000/2528339.stm">[9]</a></p>
<p>Thatcher's new system to replace local government taxes, outlined in the Conservative manifesto for the 1987 election, was introduced in <a href="/wiki/Scotland.html" title="Scotland">Scotland</a> in 1989 and in <a href="/wiki/England.html" title="England">England</a> and <a href="/wiki/Wales.html" title="Wales">Wales</a> in 1990. The rates were replaced by the Community Charge (more widely known as the "<a href="/wiki/Poll_Tax#The_Community_Charge.html" title="Poll Tax">poll tax</a>"), which applied the same amount to every individual resident, with discounts for low earners. This was to be the most universally unpopular policy of her premiership.<sup title="The text in the vicinity of this tag needs citation." class="noprint">[<a  title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><i>citation&#160;needed</i></a>]</sup></p>
<p>Additional problems emerged when many of the tax rates set by local councils proved to be much higher than earlier predictions. Opponents of the Community Charge banded together to resist <a href="/wiki/Bailiff.html" title="Bailiff">bailiffs</a> and disrupt <a href="/wiki/Court.html" title="Court">court</a> hearings of Community Charge <a href="/wiki/Debt.html" title="Debt">debtors</a>. The Labour MP, <a href="/wiki/Terry_Fields.html" title="Terry Fields">Terry Fields</a>, was jailed for 60 days for refusing on principle to pay his Community Charge. As Mrs Thatcher continued to refuse to compromise on the tax, up to 18 million people refused to pay,<sup title="The text in the vicinity of this tag needs citation." class="noprint">[<a  title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><i>citation&#160;needed</i></a>]</sup> enforcement measures became increasingly draconian, and unrest mounted and culminated in a number of <a href="/wiki/Poll_tax_Riots.html" title="Poll tax Riots">riots</a>. The most serious of these happened in London on <a href="/wiki/March_31.html" title="March 31">March 31</a>, <a href="/wiki/1990.html" title="1990">1990</a>, during a protest at <a href="/wiki/Trafalgar_Square.html" title="Trafalgar Square">Trafalgar Square</a>, <a href="/wiki/London.html" title="London">London</a>, which more than 200,000 protesters attended. The huge unpopularity of the tax was a major factor in Thatcher's downfall.</p>
<p>One of Thatcher's final acts in office was to pressure US President <a href="/wiki/George_H._W._Bush.html" title="George H. W. Bush">George H. W. Bush</a> to deploy troops to the <a href="/wiki/Middle_East.html" title="Middle East">Middle East</a> to drive <a href="/wiki/Saddam_Hussein.html" title="Saddam Hussein">Saddam Hussein</a>'s army out of <a href="/wiki/Kuwait.html" title="Kuwait">Kuwait</a>. Bush was somewhat apprehensive about the plan, but Thatcher famously told him that this was "no time to go wobbly!"</p>
<p>On the Friday before the Conservative Party conference in October 1990, Thatcher ordered her new <a href="/wiki/Chancellor_of_the_Exchequer.html" title="Chancellor of the Exchequer">Chancellor of the Exchequer</a> <a href="/wiki/John_Major.html" title="John Major">John Major</a> to reduce interest rates by 1%. Major persuaded her that the only way to maintain monetary stability was to join the Exchange Rate Mechanism at the same time, despite not meeting the 'Madrid conditions'. The Conservative Party conference that year saw a large degree of unity; few who attended could have imagined that Mrs Thatcher had only a matter of weeks left in office.</p>

<p>By 1990, opposition to Thatcher's policies on local government taxation, her Government's perceived mishandling of the economy (in particular, high <a href="/wiki/Interest_rates.html" title="Interest rates">interest rates</a> of 15%, which were eroding her support base among homeowners and businesspeople), and the divisions opening in the Conservative Party over <a href="/wiki/European_integration.html" title="European integration">European integration</a> made her and her party seem increasingly politically vulnerable.</p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/November_1.html" title="November 1">1 November</a> <a href="/wiki/1990.html" title="1990">1990</a>, Sir <a href="/wiki/Geoffrey_Howe.html" title="Geoffrey Howe">Geoffrey Howe</a>, one of Thatcher's oldest and staunchest supporters, resigned from his position as Deputy Prime Minister in protest at Thatcher's European policy. Her long-standing adversary Michael Heseltine subsequently challenged her for the leadership of the party, and attracted sufficient support in the first round of voting to prolong the contest to a second ballot. Though she initially stated that she intended to contest the second ballot, Thatcher decided, after consulting with her Cabinet colleagues, to withdraw from the contest. On <a href="/wiki/November_22.html" title="November 22">22 November</a>, at just after 9.30 a.m., she announced to the Cabinet that she would not be a candidate in the second ballot. Shortly afterwards, her staff made public what was, in effect, her resignation statement:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Having consulted widely among my colleagues, I have concluded that the unity of the Party and the prospects of victory in a General Election would be better served if I stood down to enable Cabinet colleagues to enter the ballot for the leadership. I should like to thank all those in Cabinet and outside who have given me such dedicated support.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>In defeat, Margaret Thatcher seized the opportunity of a debate in the House of Commons on a motion of confidence in her government to deliver one of her most memorable performances:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"... a single currency is about the politics of Europe, it is about a federal Europe by the back door. So I shall consider the proposal of the Honourable Member for Bolsover (<a href="/wiki/Dennis_Skinner.html" title="Dennis Skinner">Mr. Skinner</a>).

</dl>
<p>She supported <a href="/wiki/John_Major.html" title="John Major">John Major</a> as her successor and he duly won the leadership contest. After her resignation a <a href="/wiki/MORI.html" title="MORI">MORI</a> poll found that 52% agreed that "On balance she had been good for the country", with 44% agreeing that she had been "bad".<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a  title="">[5]</a></sup> In 1991, she was given a long and unprecedented standing ovation at the party's annual conference, although she politely rejected calls from delegates for her to make a speech. She did, however, occasionally speak in the House of Commons after she was Prime Minister. She retired from the House at the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election%2C_1992.html" title="United Kingdom general election, 1992">1992 election</a>.</p>

<p>In 1992, Margaret Thatcher was raised to the peerage by the conferment of the <a href="/wiki/Life_peerage.html" title="Life peerage">life barony</a> of Thatcher, of <a href="/wiki/Kesteven.html" title="Kesteven">Kesteven</a> in the County of Lincolnshire, upon her. It is interesting that she did not take a hereditary title, as she recommended for <a href="/wiki/Harold_Macmillan.html" title="Harold Macmillan">Harold Macmillan</a>, later Earl of Stockton, on his ninetieth birthday in 1984, and become the Countess Thatcher or something similar. She has explained that she thought she hadn't sufficient means to 'support' an hereditary title. By virtue of the life barony, she entered the <a href="/wiki/House_of_Lords.html" title="House of Lords">House of Lords</a>. She made a series of speeches in the Lords criticising the <a href="/wiki/Maastricht_Treaty.html" title="Maastricht Treaty">Maastricht Treaty</a>. She described it as "a treaty too far" and in June 1993 told the Lords: "I could never have signed this treaty".<a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.margaretthatcher.org/speeches/displaydocument.asp?docid=108314">[10]</a> She also advocated a referendum on the treaty, citing <a href="/wiki/A._V._Dicey.html" title="A. V. Dicey">A. V. Dicey</a>, since all three main parties were in favour of it and that therefore the people should have their say.<a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.margaretthatcher.org/speeches/displaydocument.asp?docid=108291">[11]</a></p>
<p>In August 1992, she called for NATO to stop the Serbian assault on Gorazde and Sarajevo in order to end "ethnic cleansing" and to preserve the Bosnian state. She claimed what was happening in Bosnia was "reminiscent of the worst excesses of the Nazis".<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a  title="">[6]</a></sup> In December of that same year she warned that there could be a "holocaust" in Bosnia and, after the first massacre at <a href="/wiki/Srebrenica.html" title="Srebrenica">Srebrenica</a> in April 1993, Thatcher thought it was a "killing field the like of which I thought we would never see in Europe again". She reportedly said to Douglas Hurd, the Foreign Secretary: "Douglas, Douglas, you would make <a href="/wiki/Neville_Chamberlain.html" title="Neville Chamberlain">Neville Chamberlain</a> look like a warmonger".<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a  title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>She had already been honoured by the Queen in 1990, shortly after her resignation as Prime Minister, when she was appointed to the <a href="/wiki/Order_of_Merit.html" title="Order of Merit">Order of Merit</a>, one of the UK's highest distinctions. In addition, her husband, Denis Thatcher, had been given a <a href="/wiki/Baronet.html" title="Baronet">baronetcy</a> in 1991 (ensuring that their son Mark would inherit a title). This was the first creation of a baronetcy since 1965. In 1995, Thatcher was raised to the <a href="/wiki/Order_of_the_Garter.html" title="Order of the Garter">Order of the Garter</a>, the United Kingdom's highest order of <a href="/wiki/Chivalry.html" title="Chivalry">Chivalry</a>.</p>
<p>In July 1992, she was hired by tobacco giant <a href="/wiki/Philip_Morris.html" title="Philip Morris">Philip Morris Companies</a>, now the <a href="/wiki/Altria.html" title="Altria">Altria Group</a>, as a "geopolitical consultant" for US$250,000 per year and an annual contribution of US$250,000 to her Foundation.</p>
<p>From 1993 to 2000, she served as Chancellor of the <a href="/wiki/College_of_William_and_Mary.html" title="College of William and Mary">College of William and Mary</a>, Virginia, USA, which was established by <a href="/wiki/Royal_Charter.html" title="Royal Charter">Royal Charter</a> in 1693.

She retired from the post in 1998.</p>
<p>She wrote her <a href="/wiki/Memoir.html" title="Memoir">memoirs</a> in two volumes, <i>The Path to Power</i> and <i>The Downing Street Years</i>. In 1993 <i>The Downing Street Years</i> were televised by the BBC, where she described the Cabinet rebellion that brought about her resignation as "treachery with a smile on its face".</p>
<p>Although she remained supportive in public, in private she made her displeasure with many of John Major's policies plain, and her views were conveyed to the press and widely reported. She was critical of the rise in public spending under Major, tax increases and his more favourable attitude to <a href="/wiki/European_integration.html" title="European integration">European integration</a>.

<p>In 1998, Thatcher made a highly publicised visit to the former Chilean dictator <a href="/wiki/Augusto_Pinochet.html" title="Augusto Pinochet">Augusto Pinochet</a>, while he was under house arrest in Surrey, during which she expressed her support for and friendship with him (see <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/304516.stm">[13]</a>). Pinochet had been a key ally in the <a href="/wiki/Falklands_War.html" title="Falklands War">Falklands War</a>. Margaret Thatcher and Augusto Pinochet are both members of the Rotary International. During the same year, she made a £2,000,000 donation to <a href="/wiki/University_of_Cambridge.html" title="University of Cambridge">Cambridge University</a> for the endowment of a Margaret Thatcher Chair in Entrepreneurial Studies. She also donated the archive of her personal papers to <a href="/wiki/Churchill_College%2C_Cambridge.html" title="Churchill College, Cambridge">Churchill College, Cambridge</a>.</p>
<p>She made many speaking engagements around the world, and she actively supported the Conservative general election campaign in <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election%2C_2001.html" title="United Kingdom general election, 2001">2001</a>. In the <a href="/wiki/Conservative_Party_%28UK%29_leadership_election%2C_2001.html" title="Conservative Party (UK) leadership election, 2001">Conservative leadership election</a> shortly after, Lady Thatcher came out in support of <a href="/wiki/Iain_Duncan_Smith.html" title="Iain Duncan Smith">Iain Duncan Smith</a> because she believed he would "make infinitely the better leader" than Kenneth Clarke due to Clarke's "old-fashioned views of the role of the state and his unbounded enthusiasm for European integration".<a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.margaretthatcher.org/speeches/displaydocument.asp?docid=108390">[14]</a></p>
<p>In 2002, she published <i>Statecraft: Strategies for a Changing World</i> detailing her thoughts on <a href="/wiki/International_relations.html" title="International relations">international relations</a> since her resignation in 1990. The chapters on the European Union were particularly controversial; she called for a fundamental renegotiation of Britain's membership to preserve the UK's sovereignty and, if that failed, for Britain to leave and join <a href="/wiki/North_American_Free_Trade_Agreement.html" title="North American Free Trade Agreement">NAFTA</a>. These chapters were serialised in <i>The Times</i> on Monday, <a href="/wiki/March_18.html" title="March 18">18 March</a> and caused a political furore for the rest of the week until on Friday, <a href="/wiki/March_22.html" title="March 22">22 March</a> it was announced she was advised by her doctors to make no more public speeches on health grounds, having suffered several small strokes, which left her in a very frail state.<a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.margaretthatcher.org/speeches/displaydocument.asp?docid=109305">[15]</a></p>

<p>In December 2004, it was reported that Thatcher had told a private meeting of Conservative MPs that she was against the British Government's plan to introduce <a href="/wiki/British_national_identity_card.html" title="British national identity card">identity cards</a>.

<h2>Legacy</h2>
<p>Many British citizens remember where they were and what they were doing when they heard that Margaret Thatcher had resigned and what their reaction was. She was a polarising figure, who, due to the ideological political climate of the time, brought out strong reactions from different sides of the political spectrum, an example being left wing Arthur Scargill's avid opposition to her economic reforms. Likewise, her legacy is highly disputed. <sup title="The text in the vicinity of this tag needs citation." class="noprint">[<a  title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><i>citation&#160;needed</i></a>]</sup></p>
<p>Some people credit her macroeconomic reforms with rescuing the British economy from the stagnation of the 1970s and admire her committed <a href="/wiki/Extremism.html" title="Extremism">radicalism</a> on social issues. Others see her as authoritarian and egotistical. She is accused of dismantling the <a href="/wiki/Welfare_State.html" title="Welfare State">Welfare State</a> and of destroying much of the UK's manufacturing base, whilst consigning millions of workers to long-term unemployment. However, free marketeers and pro-privatisation business leaders and economists say that it is quite the opposite, citing the recovery of the economy during the mid-1980s and the present day success of the British economy with lower unemployment due to higher levels of service sector employment.</p>
<p>The first charge reflects her government's rhetoric more than its actions, as it actually did little to reduce welfare expenditure, despite its desire to do so. The second charge may be credible in that there was a major fall in manufacturing employment, and some industries almost disappeared, though manufacturing does take a smaller share of employment and GDP as an economy modernises and the service sector expands. The UK was widely seen as the "<a href="/wiki/Sick_man_of_Europe.html" title="Sick man of Europe">sick man of Europe</a>" in the 1970s, and some argued that it would be the first developed nation to return to the status of a developing country. Instead, the UK emerged as one of the most successful economies in modern Europe.</p>
<p>Critics of this view believe that the economic problems of the 1970s were exaggerated, and were caused largely by factors outside any UK government's control, such as high <a href="/wiki/Petroleum.html" title="Petroleum">oil</a> prices caused by the <a href="/wiki/Oil_crisis.html" title="Oil crisis">oil crisis</a>, leading to the high <a href="/wiki/Inflation.html" title="Inflation">inflation</a> which damaged the economies of nearly all major industrial countries. Accordingly, they also argue that the economic downturn was not the result of <a href="/wiki/Socialism.html" title="Socialism">socialism</a> and <a href="/wiki/Trade_union.html" title="Trade union">trade unions</a>, as <a href="/wiki/Thatcherite.html" title="Thatcherite">Thatcherite</a> supporters claim. Critics also argue that the Thatcher period in government coincided with a general improvement in the world economy, and the buoyant tax revenues from <a href="/wiki/North_Sea_oil.html" title="North Sea oil">North Sea oil</a> (although this is sometimes a double-edged sword; see <a href="/wiki/Dutch_disease.html" title="Dutch disease">Dutch disease</a>), and that these were the real cause of the improved economic environment of the 1980s rather than Margaret Thatcher's policies.</p>
<p>Perceptions of Margaret Thatcher are mixed in the view of the British public. A clear illustration of the divisions of opinion over Thatcher's leadership can be found in recent television polls: Thatcher appears at number 16 in the 2002 List of "<a href="/wiki/100_Greatest_Britons.html" title="100 Greatest Britons">100 Greatest Britons</a>", which was the highest placing for a living person. She also appears at number 3 in the 2003 List of "<a href="/wiki/100_Worst_Britons.html" title="100 Worst Britons">100 Worst Britons</a>", which was confined to those living, narrowly missing out on the top spot, which went to <a href="/wiki/Labour_Party_%28UK%29.html" title="Labour Party (UK)">Labour</a> <a href="/wiki/Prime_Minister.html" title="Prime Minister">Prime Minister</a> <a href="/wiki/Tony_Blair.html" title="Tony Blair">Tony Blair</a>. In the end, however, few could argue that there was any woman who played a more important role on the world stage in the 20th century. In perhaps the sincerest form of flattery, Labour Prime Minister, Tony Blair, himself a thrice-elected Prime Minister, has implicitly and explicitly acknowledged her importance by continuing many of her economic policies. Thatcher herself indirectly acknowledged Blair during a Conservative leadership contest when she said <i>They...(The Conservative Party)...don't need someone that can beat Mr. Blair, they need someone LIKE Mr. Blair</i>.</p>
<p>Another view divides her economic legacy into two parts: market efficiency and long-term growth. The first part, due to her reforms, is quite controversial. While the unemployment rate did eventually come down, it came after initial job losses and radical labour market reforms. These included laws that weakened trade unions and the deregulation of financial markets, which certainly succeeded in returning the City to a leadership position as a European financial centre, and her push for increased competition in telecommunications and other public utilities. Long-term growth, according to available data, is considered low, due to lack of civil research and development spending, lowered education standards and ineffective job-training policies.</p>
<p>Many of her policies have proved to be divisive. In much of Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and the urban and former mining areas of northern England, she is still reviled. Many people remember the hardships of the miners' strike, which destroyed many mining communities, and the decline of traditional heavy industry, despite the subsequent boom in service industries.</p>
<p>Negative opinions of Thatcher in the mining and industrial communities were reflected in the 1987 election, which she won by a landslide through winning large numbers of seats in southern England and the rural farming areas of northern England while winning few seats in the remaining areas of the country. Through the <a href="/wiki/Common_Agricultural_Policy.html" title="Common Agricultural Policy">Common Agricultural Policy</a>, British agriculture was (and remains) heavily subsidised while other failing parts of the economy did not receive similar support. This geographical imbalance in Thatcher's support led to wide-spread feelings of alienation in Scotland, Wales and the English regions, and contributed directly to the growth of <a href="/wiki/Devolution.html" title="Devolution">devolution</a> movements in those areas.</p>
<p>Perceptions abroad broadly follow the same political divisions. On the left, Margaret Thatcher is generally regarded as somebody who used force to quash social movements, who imposed social reforms that disregarded the interests of the <a href="/wiki/Working_class.html" title="Working class">working class</a> and instead favoured the wealthier elements of the <a href="/wiki/Middle_class.html" title="Middle class">middle class</a> and business. Satirists have often caricatured her. For instance, <a href="/wiki/France.html" title="France">French</a> singer <a href="/wiki/Renaud_S%C3%A9chan.html" title="Renaud Séchan">Renaud</a> wrote a song, <i>Miss Maggie</i>, which lauded women as refraining from many of the silly behaviours of males – and every time making an exception for "Mrs Thatcher". She may be remembered most of all for declaring: "There is no such thing as society" <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://briandeer.com/social/thatcher-society.htm">[17]</a> to reporter Douglas Keay, for 'Womans Own' magazine, <a href="/wiki/September_23.html" title="September 23">23 September</a> <a href="/wiki/1987.html" title="1987">1987</a> <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.margaretthatcher.org/speeches/displaydocument.asp?docid=106689">[18]</a>,going on to emphasise the importance of families and individuals in the fabric of British life. On the economic and political <a href="/wiki/Centre_right.html" title="Centre right">centre right</a>, Thatcher is often remembered with some fondness as a conservative who dared to confront powerful unions and removed harmful constraints on the economy, though many do not openly claim to be following her example given the strong feelings that highly ideological Lady Thatcher and <a href="/wiki/Thatcherism.html" title="Thatcherism">Thatcherism</a> elicits in many.</p>
<p>Among Irish nationalists, she is generally remembered as an intransigent figure who eschewed negotiations with the Provisional IRA who had targeted her. Her critics believe this contributed to the length and ferocity of <a href="/wiki/The_Troubles.html" title="The Troubles">the Troubles</a> in <a href="/wiki/Northern_Ireland.html" title="Northern Ireland">Northern Ireland</a>, despite the efforts her government made to increase The Republic Of Ireland's involvement in Northern Ireland through the Anglo-Irish Agreement.<sup title="The text in the vicinity of this tag needs citation." class="noprint">[<a  title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><i>citation&#160;needed</i></a>]</sup></p>
<p>In 1996, the Scott Inquiry into the <a href="/wiki/Arms-to-Iraq.html" title="Arms-to-Iraq">Arms-to-Iraq</a> affair investigated the Thatcher government's record in dealing with Saddam Hussein. It revealed how £1bn of Whitehall money was used in soft loan guarantees for British exporters to Iraq.<sup title="The text in the vicinity of this tag needs citation." class="noprint">[<a  title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><i>citation&#160;needed</i></a>]</sup> The judge found that during Baghdad's protracted <a href="/wiki/Iran-Iraq_war.html" title="Iran-Iraq war">invasion of Iran in the 1980s</a>, officials destroyed documents relating to the export of <a href="/wiki/Chieftain_tank.html" title="Chieftain tank">Chieftain tank</a> parts to Jordan which ended up in Iraq.<sup title="The text in the vicinity of this tag needs citation." class="noprint">[<a  title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><i>citation&#160;needed</i></a>]</sup> Ministers clandestinely relaxed official guidelines to help private companies sell machine tools which were used in munitions factories.<sup title="The text in the vicinity of this tag needs citation." class="noprint">[<a  title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><i>citation&#160;needed</i></a>]</sup> The British company <a href="/wiki/Racal.html" title="Racal">Racal</a> exported sophisticated <a  class="new" title="Jaguar V">Jaguar V</a> radios to the former Iraqi dictator's army on credit.

<p>Many on both the right and left agree that Thatcher had a transformative effect on the British political spectrum and that her tenure had the effect of moving the major political parties rightward. <a href="/wiki/New_Labour.html" title="New Labour">New Labour</a> and <a href="/wiki/Blairism.html" title="Blairism">Blairism</a> have incorporated much of the economic, social and political tenets of "Thatcherism" in the same manner as, in a previous era, the Conservative Party from the 1950s until the days of <a href="/wiki/Edward_Heath.html" title="Edward Heath">Edward Heath</a> accepted many of the basic assumptions of the <a href="/wiki/Welfare_state.html" title="Welfare state">welfare state</a> instituted by Labour governments. The curtailing and large scale dismantling of elements of the welfare state under Thatcher have largely remained. As well, Thatcher's programme of <a href="/wiki/Privatization.html" title="Privatization">privatising</a> <a href="/wiki/Nationalisation.html" title="Nationalisation">state-owned enterprises</a> has not been reversed. Indeed, successive Tory and Labour governments have further curtailed the involvement of the state in the economy and have further dismantled public ownership.</p>
<p>For good or ill, Thatcher's impact on the <a href="/wiki/Trade_union.html" title="Trade union">trade union</a> movement in Britain has been lasting with the breaking of the <a href="/wiki/UK_miners%27_strike_%281984-1985%29.html" title="UK miners' strike (1984-1985)">miners' strike of 1984-1985</a> seen as a watershed moment, or even a breaking point, for a union movement which has been unable to regain the degree of power it exercised up to the 1970s. Unionisation rates in Britain declined under Thatcher and have not recovered and the legislative instruments introduced to curtail the impact of strikes have not been reversed. Instead, the Labour Party has worked to loosen its ties to the trade union movement.</p>
<p>Thatcher's legacy has continued strongly to influence the Conservative Party itself. Successive leaders, starting with <a href="/wiki/John_Major.html" title="John Major">John Major</a>, and continuing in opposition with <a href="/wiki/William_Hague.html" title="William Hague">William Hague</a>, <a href="/wiki/Iain_Duncan_Smith.html" title="Iain Duncan Smith">Iain Duncan Smith</a> and <a href="/wiki/Michael_Howard.html" title="Michael Howard">Michael Howard</a>, have struggled with real or imagined factions in the Parliamentary and national party to determine what parts of her heritage should be retained or jettisoned. The leadership of <a href="/wiki/David_Cameron.html" title="David Cameron">David Cameron</a> in 2006 may mark an end to this fixation, which has riven the party since Thatcher left office.</p>
<p>In a list compiled by the left leaning magazine, the <i><a href="/wiki/New_Statesman.html" title="New Statesman">New Statesman</a></i> in 2006, she was voted fifth in the list of "Heroes of our time"<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a  title="">[8]</a></sup>.</p>
