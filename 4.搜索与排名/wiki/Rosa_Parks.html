<p><a name="Early_years" id="Early_years"></a></p>
<h2>Early years</h2>
<p>Rosa Parks was born <b>Rosa Louise McCauley</b> in <a href="/wiki/Tuskegee%2C_Alabama.html" title="Tuskegee, Alabama">Tuskegee</a>, <a href="/wiki/Alabama.html" title="Alabama">Alabama</a> on <a href="/wiki/February_4.html" title="February 4">February 4</a>, <a href="/wiki/1913.html" title="1913">1913</a> to James and Leona McCauley, a <a href="/wiki/Carpenter.html" title="Carpenter">carpenter</a> and a teacher. Small even as a child, she suffered poor health and had chronic <a href="/wiki/Tonsillitis.html" title="Tonsillitis">tonsillitis</a>. When her parents separated, she moved with her mother to <a href="/wiki/Pine_Level%2C_Alabama.html" title="Pine Level, Alabama">Pine Level, Alabama</a>, just outside <a href="/wiki/Montgomery%2C_Alabama.html" title="Montgomery, Alabama">Montgomery</a>. There she grew up on a farm with her maternal grandparents, mother, and younger brother Sylvester, and began her lifelong membership in the <a href="/wiki/African_Methodist_Episcopal_Church.html" title="African Methodist Episcopal Church">African Methodist Episcopal Church</a>. Her mother Leona <a href="/wiki/Homeschooling.html" title="Homeschooling">homeschooled</a> Rosa until she was eleven, when she enrolled in the Industrial School for Girls in Montgomery, where her aunt lived, and took academic and some vocational courses. Parks then went on to a laboratory school set up by the <a href="/wiki/Alabama_State_University.html" title="Alabama State University">Alabama State Teachers College for Negroes</a> for secondary education, but was forced to drop out to care for her grandmother, and later for her mother, after she too grew ill.</p>
<p>Under <a href="/wiki/Jim_Crow_law.html" title="Jim Crow law">Jim Crow laws</a>, black and white people were segregated in virtually every aspect of daily life in the <a href="/wiki/Southern_United_States.html" title="Southern United States">South</a>, including public transportation. Bus and train companies did not provide separate vehicles for the different races, but did enforce seating policies that allocated separate sections for blacks and whites. School bus transportation, however, was unavailable in any form for black schoolchildren in the South. Parks recalled going to elementary school in Pine Level, where school buses took white students to their new school and black students had to walk to theirs: "I'd see the bus pass every day… But to me, that was a way of life; we had no choice but to accept what was the custom. The bus was among the first ways I realized there was a black world and a white world."</p>
<p>Though Parks' autobiography recounts that some of her earliest memories are of the kindness of white strangers, her situation made it impossible to ignore <a href="/wiki/Racism.html" title="Racism">racism</a>. When the <a href="/wiki/Ku_Klux_Klan.html" title="Ku Klux Klan">Ku Klux Klan</a> marched down the street in front of her house, Parks recalls her grandfather guarding the front door with a shotgun. The Montgomery Industrial School, founded and staffed by white Northerners for black children, was burned twice by <a href="/wiki/Arson.html" title="Arson">arsonists</a>, and its faculty was ostracized by the white community.</p>
<p>In 1932, Rosa married <a  class="new" title="Raymond Parks">Raymond Parks</a>, a <a href="/wiki/Barber.html" title="Barber">barber</a> from Montgomery, at her mother's house. Raymond was a member of the <a href="/wiki/NAACP.html" title="NAACP">NAACP</a>, at the time collecting money to support the <a href="/wiki/Scottsboro_Boys.html" title="Scottsboro Boys">Scottsboro Boys</a>, a group of black men falsely accused of raping two white women. After her marriage, Rosa took a number of jobs, ranging from domestic worker to hospital aide. At her husband's urging, she finished her high school studies in 1933, at a time when less than 7% of African Americans had a high school diploma. Despite the Jim Crow laws that made political participation by black people difficult, she succeeded in registering to vote on her third try.</p>
<p>In December 1943, Parks became active in the <a href="/wiki/American_Civil_Rights_Movement_%281955-1968%29.html" title="American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968)">Civil Rights Movement</a>, joined the Montgomery chapter of the NAACP, and was elected volunteer secretary to its president, <a href="/wiki/Edgar_Nixon.html" title="Edgar Nixon">Edgar Nixon</a>. Of her position, she later said, "I was the only woman there, and they needed a secretary, and I was too timid to say no." She would continue as secretary until 1957. In the 1940s, Parks and her husband were also members of the Voters' League. Sometime soon after 1944, she held a brief job at <a href="/wiki/Maxwell_Air_Force_Base.html" title="Maxwell Air Force Base">Maxwell Air Force Base</a>, a federally-owned area where <a href="/wiki/Racial_segregation.html" title="Racial segregation">racial segregation</a> was not allowed, and rode on an integrated trolley. Speaking to her biographer, Parks noted, "You might just say Maxwell opened my eyes up." Parks also worked as a housekeeper and seamstress for a white couple, <a href="/wiki/Clifford_Durr.html" title="Clifford Durr">Clifford and Virginia Durr</a>. The politically <a href="/wiki/American_liberalism.html" title="American liberalism">liberal</a> Durrs became her friends, and encouraged Parks to attend, and eventually helped sponsor her at the <a href="/wiki/Highlander_Research_and_Education_Center.html" title="Highlander Research and Education Center">Highlander Folk School</a>, an education center for workers' rights and racial equality in <a href="/wiki/Monteagle%2C_Tennessee.html" title="Monteagle, Tennessee">Monteagle, Tennessee</a>, in the summer of 1955.</p>
<p>Like many black people, Parks was deeply moved by the brutal murder of <a href="/wiki/Emmett_Till.html" title="Emmett Till">Emmett Till</a> in August 1955. On November 27, 1955—only four days before she refused to give up her seat—she later recalled that she had attended a mass meeting in Montgomery which focused on this case as well as the recent murders of <a href="/wiki/George_W._Lee.html" title="George W. Lee">George W. Lee</a> and <a href="/wiki/Lamar_Smith.html" title="Lamar Smith">Lamar Smith</a>. The featured speaker at the meeting was <a href="/wiki/T.R.M._Howard.html" title="T.R.M.

Howard</a>, a black civil rights leader from Mississippi who headed the <a href="/wiki/Regional_Council_of_Negro_Leadership.html" title="Regional Council of Negro Leadership">Regional Council of Negro Leadership</a>.</p>

<h3>Events leading up to boycott</h3>
<p>In 1944, athletic star <a href="/wiki/Jackie_Robinson.html" title="Jackie Robinson">Jackie Robinson</a> took a similar stand in a confrontation with an Army officer in <a href="/wiki/Fort_Hood.html" title="Fort Hood">Fort Hood</a>, <a href="/wiki/Texas.html" title="Texas">Texas</a>, refusing to move to the back of a bus. He was brought before a <a href="/wiki/Court-martial.html" title="Court-martial">court-martial</a>, which acquitted him.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a  title="">[1]</a></sup> The NAACP had accepted and litigated other cases before, such as that of <a href="/wiki/Irene_Morgan.html" title="Irene Morgan">Irene Morgan</a> ten years earlier, which resulted in a victory in the <a href="/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States.html" title="Supreme Court of the United States">U.S. Supreme Court</a> on <a href="/wiki/Commerce_Clause.html" title="Commerce Clause">Commerce Clause</a> grounds. That victory, however, overturned state segregation laws only insofar as they applied to travel in interstate commerce, such as interstate bus travel. Black activists had begun to build a case around the arrest of a 15-year-old girl, <a href="/wiki/Claudette_Colvin.html" title="Claudette Colvin">Claudette Colvin</a>, a student at Booker T. Washington High School in Montgomery. On <a href="/wiki/March_2.html" title="March 2">March 2</a>, <a href="/wiki/1955.html" title="1955">1955</a>, Colvin was handcuffed, arrested and forcibly removed from a public bus when she refused to give up her seat to a white man. She screamed that her constitutional rights were being violated. At the time, Colvin was active in the NAACP's Youth Council, a group to which Rosa Parks served as Advisor.</p>

<p>Colvin recollected, "Mrs. Parks said, 'Always do what was right.'" Parks was raising money for Colvin's defense, but when E.D. Nixon learned that Colvin was pregnant, it was decided that Colvin was an unsuitable symbol for their cause. Soon after her arrest she had been impregnated by a much older married man, a moral transgression that scandalized the deeply religious black community. Strategists believed that the segregationist white press would use Colvin's pregnancy to undermine any boycott. Some historians have argued that civil rights leaders, who were predominantly middle class, were uneasy with Colvin's impoverished background. <sup title="The text in the vicinity of this tag needs citation." class="noprint">[<a  title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><i>citation&#160;needed</i></a>]</sup> The NAACP also had considered, but rejected, earlier protesters deemed unable or unsuitable to withstand the pressures of cross-examination in a legal challenge to racial segregation laws. Colvin was also known to engage in verbal outbursts and cursing. Many of the legal charges against Colvin were dropped. A boycott and legal case never materialized from the Colvin case law, and legal strategists continued to seek a complainant beyond reproach.They didn't publicize Colvin's case because she was pregnant. <sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a  title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/Montgomery%2C_Alabama.html" title="Montgomery, Alabama">Montgomery, Alabama</a>, the first four rows of bus seats were reserved for white people. Buses had "colored" sections for black people—who made up more than 75 % of the bus system's riders—generally in the rear of the bus. These sections were not fixed in size, but were determined by the placement of a movable sign. Black people also could sit in the middle rows, until the white section was full. Then they had to move to seats in the rear, stand, or, if there was no room, leave the bus. Black people were not allowed to sit across the aisle from white people. The driver also could move the "colored" section sign, or remove it altogether. If white people were already sitting in the front, black people could board to pay the fare, but then had to disembark and reenter through the rear door. There were times when the bus departed before the black customers who had paid made it to the back entrance.</p>
<p>For years, the black community had complained that the situation was unfair, and Parks was no exception: "My resisting being mistreated on the bus did not begin with that particular arrest…I did a lot of walking in Montgomery." Parks had her first run-in on the public bus on a rainy day in 1943, when the bus driver, <a href="/wiki/James_Blake_%28bus_driver%29.html" title="James Blake (bus driver)">James Blake</a>, demanded that she get off the bus and reenter through the back door. As she began to exit by the front door, she dropped her purse. Parks sat down for a moment in a seat for white passengers, apparently to pick up her purse. The bus driver was enraged and barely let her step off the bus before speeding off. Rosa walked more than five miles home in the rain.</p>

<p>After a day at work at Montgomery Fair department store, Parks boarded the Cleveland Avenue bus at around 6 p.m., Thursday, <a href="/wiki/December_1.html" title="December 1">December 1</a>, <a href="/wiki/1955.html" title="1955">1955</a>, in downtown Montgomery. She paid her fare and sat in an empty seat in the first row of back seats reserved for blacks in the "colored" section, which was near the middle of the bus and directly behind the ten seats reserved for white passengers. Initially, she had not noticed that the bus driver was the same man, <a href="/wiki/James_F._Blake.html" title="James F. Blake">James F. Blake</a>, who had left her in the rain in 1943. As the bus traveled along its regular route, all of the white-only seats in the bus filled up. The bus reached the third stop in front of the Empire Theater, and several white passengers boarded.</p>
<p>In 1900, Montgomery had passed a city ordinance for the purpose of segregating passengers by race. Conductors were given the power to assign seats to accomplish that purpose; however, no passengers would be required to move or give up their seat and stand if the bus was crowded and no other seats were available. Over time and by custom, however, Montgomery bus drivers had adopted the practice of requiring black riders to move whenever there were no white only seats left.</p>
<p>So, following standard practice, bus driver Blake noted that the front of the bus was filled with white passengers and there were two or three men standing, and thus moved the "colored" section sign behind Parks and demanded that four black people give up their seats in the middle section so that the white passengers could sit. Years later, in recalling the events of the day, Parks said, "When that white driver stepped back toward us, when he waved his hand and ordered us up and out of our seats, I felt a determination cover my body like a quilt on a winter night."</p>
<p>By Parks' account, Blake said, "Y'all better make it light on yourselves and let me have those seats." <sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a  title="">[3]</a></sup> Three of them complied. Parks said, "The driver wanted us to stand up, the four of us. We didn't move at the beginning, but he says, 'Let me have these seats.' And the other three people moved, but I didn't." <sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a  title="">[4]</a></sup> The black man sitting next to her gave up his seat. Parks moved, but toward the window seat; she did not get up to move to the newly repositioned colored section.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a  title="">[5]</a></sup> Blake then said, "Why don't you stand up?" Parks responded, "I don't think I should have to stand up." Blake called the police to arrest Parks. When recalling the incident for <i><a href="/wiki/Eyes_on_the_Prize.html" title="Eyes on the Prize">Eyes on the Prize</a></i>, a 1987 public television series on the Civil Rights Movement, Parks said, "When he saw me still sitting, he asked if I was going to stand up, and I said, 'No, I'm not.' And he said, 'Well, if you don't stand up, I'm going to have to call the police and have you arrested.' I said, 'You may do that.'"</p>
<p>During a 1956 radio interview with Sydney Rogers in <a href="/wiki/West_Oakland.html" title="West Oakland">West Oakland</a> several months after her arrest, when asked why she had decided not to vacate her bus seat, Parks said, "I would have to know for once and for all what rights I had as a human being and a citizen of Montgomery, Alabama."</p>
<p>Parks also detailed her motivation in her autobiography, <i>My Story</i><sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a  title="">[6]</a></sup></p>

<p>When Parks refused to give up her seat, a police officer arrested her. As the officer took her away, she recalled that she asked, "Why do you push us around?" The officer's response as she remembered it was, "I don't know, but the law's the law, and you're under arrest." She later said, "I only knew that, as I was being arrested, that it was the very last time that I would ever ride in humiliation of this kind."</p>
<p>Parks was charged with a violation of Chapter 6, Section 11 segregation law of the Montgomery City code, even though she technically had not taken up a white-only seat—she had been in a colored section. E.D. Nixon and Clifford Durr bailed Parks out of jail the evening of December 1. Nixon then persuaded her to allow her case to be used to challenge the city's bus segregation policy. That evening, Nixon conferred with Alabama State College professor Jo Ann Robinson about Parks' case. Nixon also consulted African American attorney <a href="/wiki/Fred_Gray.html" title="Fred Gray">Fred Gray</a>. Together, they agreed that a long-term legal challenge of bus segregation should be underscored by a one-day boycott of the bus system. Nixon and Robinson went about setting the boycott into motion that evening. Nixon spent the late evening talking and drawing up a list of prominent black leaders from Montgomery for support.</p>
<p>Four days later, Parks was tried on charges of <a href="/wiki/Disorderly_conduct.html" title="Disorderly conduct">disorderly conduct</a> and violating a local ordinance. The trial lasted 30 minutes. Parks was found guilty and fined $10, plus $4 in court costs.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a  title="">[7]</a></sup> Parks appealed her conviction and formally challenged the legality of racial segregation. In a 1992 interview with <a href="/wiki/National_Public_Radio.html" title="National Public Radio">National Public Radio</a>'s Lynn Neary, Parks recalled:</p>

<td>I did not want to be mistreated, I did not want to be deprived of a seat that I had paid for. It was just time... there was opportunity for me to take a stand to express the way I felt about being treated in that manner. I had not planned to get arrested.

</div>
<p>On Monday, <a href="/wiki/December_5.html" title="December 5">December 5</a>, <a href="/wiki/1955.html" title="1955">1955</a>, a group of 16 to 18 people gathered at the Mt. Zion AME Zion Church to discuss boycott strategies. The group agreed that a new organization was needed to lead the boycott effort if it were to continue. Rev. <a href="/wiki/Ralph_David_Abernathy.html" title="Ralph David Abernathy">Ralph David Abernathy</a> suggested the name "<a href="/wiki/Montgomery_Improvement_Association.html" title="Montgomery Improvement Association">Montgomery Improvement Association</a>" (MIA). The name was adopted, and the MIA was formed. Its members elected as their president a relative newcomer to Montgomery, a young and mostly unknown minister of Dexter Avenue Baptist Church, Dr. <a href="/wiki/Martin_Luther_King%2C_Jr.html" title="Martin Luther King, Jr">Martin Luther King, Jr</a>.</p>
<p>That Monday night, 50 leaders of the African American community gathered to discuss the proper actions to be taken in response to Parks' arrest. E.D. Nixon said, "My God, look what segregation has put in my hands!" Parks was the ideal plaintiff for a test case against city and state segregation laws. While the 15-year-old Claudette Colvin, unwed and pregnant, had been deemed unacceptable to be the center of a civil rights mobilization, King stated that, "Mrs. Parks, on the other hand, was regarded as one of the finest citizens of Montgomery—not one of the finest Negro citizens, but one of the finest citizens of Montgomery." Parks was securely married and employed, possessed a quiet and dignified demeanor, and was politically savvy.</p>

<p>The night of Friday, <a href="/wiki/December_2.html" title="December 2">December 2</a>, <a href="/wiki/1955.html" title="1955">1955</a>, <a href="/wiki/Jo_Ann_Robinson.html" title="Jo Ann Robinson">Jo Ann Robinson</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Women%27s_Political_Council.html" title="Women's Political Council">Women's Political Council</a> (WPC) <a href="/wiki/Mimeograph.html" title="Mimeograph">mimeographed</a> over 35,000 handbills announcing a bus boycott. The WPC was the first group to officially endorse the boycott.</p>
<p>On Sunday, <a href="/wiki/December_4.html" title="December 4">December 4</a>, <a href="/wiki/1955.html" title="1955">1955</a>, plans for the <a href="/wiki/Montgomery_Bus_Boycott.html" title="Montgomery Bus Boycott">Montgomery Bus Boycott</a> were announced at black churches in the area, and a front-page article in <i><a href="/wiki/The_Montgomery_Advertiser.html" title="The Montgomery Advertiser">The Montgomery Advertiser</a></i> helped spread the word. At a church rally that night, attendees unanimously agreed to continue the boycott until they were treated with the level of courtesy they expected, until black drivers were hired, and until seating in the middle of the bus was handled on a first-come basis.</p>
<p>The day of Parks' trial, Monday, <a href="/wiki/December_5.html" title="December 5">December 5</a>, <a href="/wiki/1955.html" title="1955">1955</a>, the WPC distributed the 35,000 leaflets. The handbill read, "We are…asking every Negro to stay off the buses Monday in protest of the arrest and trial…. You can afford to stay out of school for one day. If you work, take a cab, or walk. But please, children and grown-ups, don't ride the bus at all on Monday. Please stay off the buses Monday."<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a  title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>It rained that day, but the black community persevered in their boycott. Some rode in carpools, while others traveled in black-operated cabs that charged the same fare as the bus, 10 cents. Most of the remainder of the 40,000 black commuters walked, some as far as 20 miles. In the end, the boycott lasted for 382 days. Dozens of public buses stood idle for months, severely damaging the bus transit company's finances, until the law requiring segregation on public buses was lifted.</p>
<p>Some segregationists retaliated with terrorism. Black churches were burned or dynamited. Martin Luther King's home was bombed in the early morning hours of <a href="/wiki/January_30.html" title="January 30">January 30</a>, <a href="/wiki/1956.html" title="1956">1956</a>, and E.D. Nixon's home was also attacked. However, the black community's bus boycott marked one of the largest and most successful mass movements against racial segregation. It sparked many other protests, and it catapulted King to the forefront of the Civil Rights Movement.</p>
<p>Through her role in sparking the boycott, Rosa Parks played an important part in internationalizing the awareness of the plight of African Americans and the civil rights struggle. King wrote in his 1958 book <i><a  class="new" title="Stride Toward Freedom">Stride Toward Freedom</a></i> that Parks' arrest was the precipitating factor, rather than the cause, of the protest: "The cause lay deep in the record of similar injustices…. Actually, no one can understand the action of Mrs. Parks unless he realizes that eventually the cup of endurance runs over, and the human personality cries out, 'I can take it no longer.'"</p>
<p>The Montgomery bus boycott was also the inspiration for the bus boycott in the township of Alexandria in <a href="/wiki/South_Africa.html" title="South Africa">South Africa</a> which was one of the key events in the radicalization of the black majority of that country under the leadership of the <a href="/wiki/African_National_Congress.html" title="African National Congress">African National Congress</a>.</p>

<h3>Browder v. Gayle</h3>
<p>Immediately after the initiation of the bus boycott, legal strategists began to discuss the need for a federal lawsuit to challenge city and state bus segregation laws, and approximately two months after the boycott began, they reconsidered Claudette Colvin's case. Attorneys <a href="/wiki/Fred_Gray.html" title="Fred Gray">Fred Gray</a>, <a href="/wiki/E.D._Nixon.html" title="E.D. Nixon">E.D. Nixon</a> and <a href="/wiki/Clifford_Durr.html" title="Clifford Durr">Clifford Durr</a> (a white lawyer who, with his wife, Virginia, was an activist in the Civil Rights Movement and a former employer of Parks) searched for the ideal case law to challenge the constitutional legitimacy of city and state bus segregation laws. Parks' case was not used as the basis for the federal lawsuit because, as a criminal case, it would have had to make its way through the state criminal appeals process before a federal appeal could have been filed. City and state officials could have delayed a final rendering for years. Furthermore, attorney Durr believed it possible that the outcome would merely have been the vacating of Parks' conviction, with no changes in segregation laws.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a  title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p>Gray researched for a better lawsuit, consulting with NAACP legal counsels Robert Carter and <a href="/wiki/Thurgood_Marshall.html" title="Thurgood Marshall">Thurgood Marshall</a>, who would later become U.S. solicitor general and a U.S. Supreme Court justice. Gray approached Aurelia Browder, Susie McDonald, Claudette Colvin and Mary Louise Smith, all women who had had disputes involving the Montgomery bus system the previous year. They all agreed to become plaintiffs in a civil action law suit. Browder was a Montgomery housewife, Gayle the mayor of Montgomery. <a href="/wiki/February_1.html" title="February 1">February 1</a>, <a href="/wiki/1956.html" title="1956">1956</a>, the case of <i><a href="/wiki/Browder_v._Gayle.html" title="Browder v.

Gayle</i> that brought segregation to an end on public buses.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a  title="">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p><a href="/wiki/June_19.html" title="June 19">June 19</a>, <a href="/wiki/1956.html" title="1956">1956</a>, the U.S. District Court's three-judge panel ruled that Section 301 (31a, 31b and 31c) of Title 48, Code of Alabama, 1940, as amended, and Sections 10 and 11 of Chapter 6 of the Code of the City of Montgomery, 1952, "deny and deprive plaintiffs and other Negro citizens similarly situated of the equal protection of the laws and due process of law secured by the Fourteenth Amendment" (<i>Browder v. Gayle</i>, 1956). The court essentially decided that the precedent of <i><a href="/wiki/Brown_v._Board_of_Education.html" title="Brown v. Board of Education">Brown v.

<p>After her arrest, Parks became an icon of the Civil Rights Movement, but suffered hardships as a result. She lost her job at the department store, and her husband quit his job after his boss forbade him from talking about his wife or the legal case. Parks traveled and spoke extensively. In 1957, Raymond and Rosa Parks left Montgomery for Hampton, Virginia—mostly because she was unable to find work, but also because of disagreements with King and other leaders of Montgomery's struggling civil rights movement. In Hampton, she found a job as a hostess in an inn at black <a href="/wiki/Hampton_University.html" title="Hampton University">Hampton Institute</a>. Later that year, after the urging of her younger brother Sylvester Parks, her husband Raymond, and her mother Leona McCauley, moved to <a href="/wiki/Detroit%2C_Michigan.html" title="Detroit, Michigan">Detroit, Michigan</a>.</p>
<p>Parks worked as a seamstress until 1965, when African-American <a href="/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives.html" title="United States House of Representatives">U.S. Representative</a> <a href="/wiki/John_Conyers.html" title="John Conyers">John Conyers</a> (<a href="/wiki/Democratic_Party_of_the_United_States.html" title="Democratic Party of the United States">D</a>-<a href="/wiki/Michigan.html" title="Michigan">Michigan</a>) hired her as a secretary and receptionist for his congressional office in Detroit.

There is only one Rosa Parks." Later in life, Parks also served as a member of the Board of Advocates of the <a href="/wiki/Planned_Parenthood.html" title="Planned Parenthood">Planned Parenthood</a> Federation of America.</p>
<p>Rosa Parks and Elaine Eason Steele co-founded the Rosa and Raymond Parks Institute for Self Development in February 1987, in honor of Rosa's husband, who died from cancer in 1977. The institute runs the "Pathways to Freedom" bus tours, which introduce young people to important civil rights and <a href="/wiki/Underground_Railroad.html" title="Underground Railroad">Underground Railroad</a> sites throughout the country. On a 1997 trip, the Pathways to Freedom bus drove into a river, resulting in the death of Adisa Foluke.

<p>In 1992, Parks published <i>Rosa Parks: My Story</i>, an autobiography aimed at younger readers which details her life leading up to her decision not to give up her seat.

The incident sparked outrage throughout America. After his arrest, Skipper said that he had not known he was in Parks' home, but recognized her after entering. Skipper asked, "Hey, aren't you Rosa Parks?" to which she replied, "Yes." She handed him $3 when he demanded money, and an additional $50 when he demanded more. Before fleeing, Skipper struck Parks in the face.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a  title="">[12]</a></sup> Skipper was arrested and charged with various breaking and entering offenses against Parks and other neighborhood victims.

<h3>Lawsuits</h3>
<p>In March 1999, a lawsuit was filed on Parks' behalf against American hip-hop duo <a href="/wiki/OutKast.html" title="OutKast">OutKast</a> and <a href="/wiki/LaFace_Records.html" title="LaFace Records">LaFace Records</a>, claiming that the group had illegally used Rosa Parks' name without her permission for the song "Rosa Parks", the most successful radio single of OutKast's 1998 album <i><a href="/wiki/Aquemini.html" title="Aquemini">Aquemini</a></i>. The song's chorus, which Parks' legal defense felt was disrespectful to Parks, is as follows: "Ah ha, hush that fuss / Everybody move to the back of the bus / Do you want to bump and slump with us / We the type of people make the club get crunk."</p>
<p>The case was dismissed in November 1999 by US District Court Judge Barbara Hackett. In August 2000, Parks hired attorney <a href="/wiki/Johnnie_Cochran.html" title="Johnnie Cochran">Johnnie Cochran</a> to help her appeal the district court's decision. Cochran argued that the song did not have First Amendment protection because, although its title carried Parks' name, its lyrics were not about her. However, U.S. District Judge Barbara Hackett upheld OutKast's right to use Parks' name in November 1999, and Parks took the case to the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, where some charges were remanded for further trial.</p>

<p>City officials in Montgomery and Detroit announced on <a href="/wiki/October_27.html" title="October 27">October 27</a> that the front seats of their city buses would be reserved with black ribbons in honor of Parks until her funeral.
