<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Network effect business models">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Network_effect_business_models" id="Network_effect_business_models"></a></p>
<h2>Network effect business models</h2>
<p>Network effects were used as justification for some of the <a href="/wiki/Dot-com_company.html" title="Dot-com company">dot-com</a> <a href="/wiki/Business_model.html" title="Business model">business models</a> in the late <a href="/wiki/1990s.html" title="1990s">1990s</a>. These firms operated under the belief that when a new <a href="/wiki/Market.html" title="Market">market</a> comes into being which contains strong network effects, firms should care more about growing their <a href="/wiki/Market_share.html" title="Market share">market share</a> than about becoming <a href="/wiki/Profit.html" title="Profit">profitable</a>. This was believed because market share will determine which firm can set technical and <a  class="new" title="Marketing standard">marketing standards</a> and thus determine the basis of future <a href="/wiki/Competition.html" title="Competition">competition</a>.</p>
<p>A good example of this <a href="/wiki/Strategy.html" title="Strategy">strategy</a> was that deployed by <a href="/wiki/Mirabilis_%28company%29.html" title="Mirabilis (company)">Mirabilis</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Israel.html" title="Israel">Israeli</a> start-up which pioneered <a href="/wiki/Instant_messaging.html" title="Instant messaging">instant messaging</a> (IM) and was bought by <a href="/wiki/AOL.html" title="AOL">America Online</a>. By giving away their <a href="/wiki/ICQ.html" title="ICQ">ICQ</a> product <a href="/wiki/Free_as_in_beer.html" title="Free as in beer">for free</a> and preventing <a href="/wiki/Interoperability.html" title="Interoperability">interoperability</a> between their client <a href="/wiki/Software.html" title="Software">software</a> and other products, they were able to corner the market for instant messaging. Because of the network effect, new IM users gained much more value by choosing to use the Mirabilis system (and join its large network of users) than they would using a competing system. As was typical for that era, the company never made any attempt to generate profits from their dominant position before selling out.</p>
<p>Network effects become significant after a certain subscription percentage has been achieved, called <a href="/wiki/Critical_mass_%28nuclear%29.html" title="Critical mass (nuclear)">critical mass</a>. At the critical mass point, the value obtained from the good or service is greater than or equal to the price paid for the good or service. As the value of the good is determined by the user base, this implies that after a certain number of people have subscribed to the service or purchased the good, additional people will subscribe to the service or purchase the good due to the positive utility<b>:</b>price ratio. Until this point has been achieved, however, only <a href="/wiki/Early_adopter.html" title="Early adopter">early adopters</a> will subscribe.</p>
<p>The increasing number of subscribers cannot continue indefinitely. After a certain point, most networks become either congested or saturated, stopping future uptake. Congestion occurs due to overuse. The applicable analogy is that of a telephone network. While the number of users is below the congestion point, each additional user adds additional value to every other customer. However, at some point the addition of an extra user exceeds the capacity of the existing system. After this point, each additional user decreases the value obtained by every other user. In practical terms, each additional user increases the total system <a href="/wiki/Load.html" title="Load">load</a>, leading to <a href="/wiki/Busy_signal.html" title="Busy signal">busy signals</a>, the inability to get a <a href="/wiki/Dial_tone.html" title="Dial tone">dial tone</a>, and poor <a href="/wiki/Customer_support.html" title="Customer support">customer support</a>. The next critical point is where the value obtained again equals the price paid. The network will cease to grow at this point, and the system must be enlarged. The <a  class="new" title="Congestion point">congestion point</a> may be larger than the <a  class="new" title="Market size">market size</a>. New <a href="/wiki/Peer-to-peer.html" title="Peer-to-peer">Peer-to-peer</a> technological models may always defy congestion. Peer-to-Peer systems, or "P2P," are networks designed to distribute load among their user pool. This theoretically allows true P2P networks to scale indefinitely. But <a href="/wiki/Market_saturation.html" title="Market saturation">market saturation</a> will still occur.</p>
<p>Network effects are commonly mistaken for <a href="/wiki/Economies_of_scale.html" title="Economies of scale">economies of scale</a>, which result from business size rather than <a href="/wiki/Interoperability.html" title="Interoperability">interoperability</a> (see also <a href="/wiki/Natural_monopoly.html" title="Natural monopoly">natural monopoly</a>). To help clarify the distinction people speak of <a  class="new" title="Demand side">demand side</a> vs. <a  class="new" title="Supply side">supply side</a> economies of scale. Classical economies of scale are on the <a href="/wiki/Production.html" title="Production">production</a> side, while network effects arise on the demand side. Network effects are also mistaken for <a href="/wiki/Economies_of_scope.html" title="Economies of scope">economies of scope</a>.</p>

<h2>Examples</h2>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Financial Exchanges">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Financial_Exchanges" id="Financial_Exchanges"></a></p>
<h3>Financial Exchanges</h3>
<p><a href="/wiki/Stock_exchanges.html" title="Stock exchanges">Stock exchanges</a> and <a href="/wiki/Derivatives_exchanges.html" title="Derivatives exchanges">derivatives exchanges</a> feature a network effect. <a href="/wiki/Market_liquidity.html" title="Market liquidity">Market liquidity</a> is a major determinant of transaction cost in the sale or purchase of a security, as a <a href="/wiki/Bid-ask_spread.html" title="Bid-ask spread">bid-ask spread</a> exists between the price at which a purchase can be done versus the price at which the sale of the same security can be done. As the number of buyers and sellers on an exchange increases, liquidity increases, and transaction costs decrease. This then attracts a larger number of buyers and sellers to the exchange.</p>
<p>The network advantage of financial exchanges is apparent in the difficulty that startup exchanges have in dislodging a dominant exchange. For example, the <a href="/wiki/Chicago_Board_of_Trade.html" title="Chicago Board of Trade">Chicago Board of Trade</a> has retained overwhelming dominance of trading in US <a href="/wiki/Treasury_Bond.html" title="Treasury Bond">Treasury Bond</a> futures despite the startup of <a href="/wiki/Eurex.html" title="Eurex">Eurex</a> US trading of identical futures contracts. Similarly, the <a href="/wiki/Chicago_Mercantile_Exchange.html" title="Chicago Mercantile Exchange">Chicago Mercantile Exchange</a> has maintained a dominance in trading of Eurobond interest rate futures despite a challenge from <a  class="new" title="Euronext.Liffe">Euronext.Liffe</a>.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Software">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Software" id="Software"></a></p>
<h3>Software</h3>
<p>There are very strong network effects operating in the market for widely-used computer software.</p>
<p>Take for example <a href="/wiki/Microsoft_Office.html" title="Microsoft Office">Microsoft Office</a>. For many people choosing an <a href="/wiki/Office_suite.html" title="Office suite">office suite</a>, prime considerations include how valuable having learned that office suite will prove to potential <a href="/wiki/Employer.html" title="Employer">employers</a>, and how well the software interoperates with other users. That is, since learning to use an office suite takes many hours, they want to invest that time learning the office suite that will make them most attractive to potential employers (or consulting <a href="/wiki/Consumer.html" title="Consumer">clients</a>, etc), and they also want to be able to share documents. (Additionally, an example of an indirect network effect in this case is the notable similarity in <a href="/wiki/User-interface.html" title="User-interface">user-interfaces</a> and operability menus of most new software - since that similarity directly translates into less time spent learning new environments, therefore potentially greater acceptance and adoption of those products.)</p>
<p>Similarly, finding already-trained <a href="/wiki/Employee.html" title="Employee">employees</a> is a big concern for employers when deciding which office suite to purchase or standardize on. The lack of <a href="/wiki/Cross-platform.html" title="Cross-platform">cross-platform</a> standards results in a situation in which one firm is in control of almost 100% of the market.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Microsoft_Windows.html" title="Microsoft Windows">Microsoft Windows</a> is a further example of network effect. The most-vaunted advantage of Windows, and that most publicised by Microsoft, is that Windows is compatible with the widest range of hardware and software. Although this is true, it is in reality the result of network effect: hardware and software manufacturers ensure that their products are compatible with Windows in order to have access to the large market of Windows users. Thus, Windows is popular because it is well supported, but is well supported because it is popular. However, network effects need not lead to market dominance by one firm, when there are standards which allow multiple firms to interoperate, thus allowing the network externalities to benefit the entire market. This is true for the case of <a href="/wiki/X86.html" title="X86">x86</a>-based <a href="/wiki/Personal_computer.html" title="Personal computer">personal computer</a> <a href="/wiki/Hardware.html" title="Hardware">hardware</a>, in which there are extremely strong market pressures to interoperate with pre-existing standards, but in which no one firm dominates in the market. The same holds true for the market for <a href="/wiki/Long-distance_telephone_service.html" title="Long-distance telephone service">long-distance telephone service</a> within the <a href="/wiki/United_States.html" title="United States">United States</a>. In fact, the existence of these types of networks discourages dominance of the market by one company, as it creates pressures which work against one company attempting to establish a proprietary protocol or to even distinguish itself by means of product differentiation.</p>
<p>In cases in which the relevant communication protocols are under the control of a single company, however, the network effect can give the company monopoly power. The <a href="/wiki/Microsoft.html" title="Microsoft">Microsoft</a> corporation is widely seen by computer professionals as maintaining its monopoly through these means. One observed method Microsoft uses to put the network effect to its advantage is called <a href="/wiki/Embrace_and_extend.html" title="Embrace and extend">embrace and extend</a> (derisively called <a href="/wiki/Embrace%2C_extend_and_extinguish.html" title="Embrace, extend and extinguish">embrace, extend, and extinguish</a>).</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Websites">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Websites" id="Websites"></a></p>
<h3>Websites</h3>
<p>Many <a href="/wiki/Website.html" title="Website">websites</a> also feature a network effect. One example is web marketplaces and exchanges, in that the value of the marketplace to a new user is proportional to the number of other users in the market. For example, <a href="/wiki/EBay.html" title="EBay">eBay</a> would not be a particularly useful site if <a href="/wiki/Auction.html" title="Auction">auctions</a> were not competitive. However, as the numbers of users grows on eBay, auctions grow more competitive, pushing up the prices of bids on items. This makes it more worthwhile to sell on eBay and brings more sellers onto eBay, which drives prices down again as this increases supply, while bringing more people onto eBay because there are more things being sold that people want. Essentially, as the number of users of eBay grows, prices fall and supply increases, and more and more people find the site to be useful.</p>
<p>The collaborative encyclopedia <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a> also benefits from a network effect. The theory goes that as the number of editors grows, the quality of information on the website improves, encouraging more users to turn to it as a source of information; some of the new users in turn become editors, continuing the process.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Social_networking.html" title="Social networking">Social networking</a> websites are also good examples. The more people register onto a social networking website, the more useful the website is to its registrants.</p>
<p>By contrast, the value of a news site is primarily proportional to the quality of the articles, not to the number of other people using the site. Similarly, the first generation of search sites experienced little network effect, as the value of the site was based on the value of the search results. This allowed <a href="/wiki/Google.html" title="Google">Google</a> to win users away from <a href="/wiki/Yahoo%21.html" title="Yahoo!">Yahoo!</a> without much trouble, once users believed that Google's search results were superior. Some commentators mistook the value of the Yahoo! brand (which does increase as more people know of it) for a network effect protecting its advertising business.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Alexa_Internet.html" title="Alexa Internet">Alexa Internet</a> uses a technology that tracks users' surfing patterns; thus Alexa's Related Sites results improve as more users use the technology. As theory would predict, no competing technology has emerged to compete successfully with Alexa, but this may be because of other factors. Alexa's network relies heavily on a small number of browser software relationships, which makes the network more vulnerable to competition.</p>
<p>Google has also attempted to create a network effect in its advertising business with its Google AdSense service. <a href="/wiki/Google_AdSense.html" title="Google AdSense">Google AdSense</a> places ads on many small sites, such as <a href="/wiki/Blog.html" title="Blog">blogs</a>, using Google technology to determine which ads are relevant to which blogs. Thus, the service appears to aim to serve as an exchange (or ad network) for matching many advertisers with many small sites (such as blogs). In general, the more blogs Google AdSense can reach, the more advertisers it will attract, making it the most attractive option for more blogs, and so on, making the network more valuable for all participants.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Network effects and technology lifecycle">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Network_effects_and_technology_lifecycle" id="Network_effects_and_technology_lifecycle"></a></p>
<h2>Network effects and technology lifecycle</h2>
<p>If some existing technology or company whose benefits are largely based on network effects starts to lose market share against a challenger such as a <a href="/wiki/Disruptive_technology.html" title="Disruptive technology">disruptive technology</a> or <a href="/wiki/Open_standards.html" title="Open standards">open standards</a> based competition, the benefits of network effects will reduce for the incumbent, and increase for the challenger.</p>
<p>In this model, a <a href="/wiki/Tipping_point.html" title="Tipping point">tipping point</a> is eventually reached at which the network effects of the challenger dominate those of the former incumbent, and the incumbent is forced into an accelerating decline, whilst the challenger takes over the incumbent's former position.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Network Effects and Lock-in">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Network_Effects_and_Lock-in" id="Network_Effects_and_Lock-in"></a></p>
<h3>Network Effects and Lock-in</h3>
<p>Not surprisingly network economics became a hot topic after the diffusion of the <a href="/wiki/Internet.html" title="Internet">internet</a> across <a href="/wiki/Academia.html" title="Academia">academia</a>. Most people know only of <a href="/wiki/Metcalfe%27s_law.html" title="Metcalfe's law">Metcalfe's law</a> as part of network effects. Network effects are notorious for causing <a href="/wiki/Vendor_lock-in.html" title="Vendor lock-in">vendor lock-in</a> with the most-cited examples being <a href="/wiki/Microsoft.html" title="Microsoft">Microsoft</a> products and the <a href="/wiki/Qwerty.html" title="Qwerty">qwerty</a> keyboard.</p>
<p>Network effects are a source of, but distinct from, lock-in. Lock-in can result from network effects, and network effects generate increasing returns that are associated with lock-in. However, the presence of a network effect does not guarantee that lock-in will result. For example, if the network is open there is no issue of lock-in.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Types of Network effects">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Types_of_Network_effects" id="Types_of_Network_effects"></a></p>
<h3>Types of Network effects</h3>
<p>There are two kinds of <a  class="new" title="Economic value">economic value</a> to be concerned about when thinking of network effects:<br />
Inherent - my value from my using the product<br />
Network - my value from your using the product.</p>
<p>Network value itself can be direct or indirect.</p>
<p>Direct network value is an immediate result of other users adopting the same system. For example, other people owning fax machines or using email.</p>
<p>Indirect is a secondary result of many people using the same system. For example, complementary goods are cheaper or more available when many people adopt a standard. Toner may be cheaper for widely used printers. An example of this is that Windows and Linux can be seen as competing not for users, but for <a href="/wiki/Software_developer.html" title="Software developer">software developers</a>, as shown by <a  class="external text" title="http://web.si.umich.edu/tprc/papers/2005/487/Two-sided.pdf">Nicholas Economides</a>. This may go a long way to explaining the underlying source of consistent bad <a href="/wiki/Usability.html" title="Usability">usability</a> in Windows products.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Negative and Positive Network Effects">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Negative_and_Positive_Network_Effects" id="Negative_and_Positive_Network_Effects"></a></p>
<h3>Negative and Positive Network Effects</h3>
<p>Positive networks effects are obvious. More people means more interaction. <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a> itself depends on positive network effects. Negative Network effects beyond lock-in also exist.</p>
<p>Negative network effects result from resource limits. Consider the connection that overloads the freeway -- or the competition for bandwidth.</p>
<p>In fact, the automobile and <a href="/wiki/Ethernet.html" title="Ethernet">ethernet</a> speed examples illustrate that there can be threshold limits. In this case, the n+1 person begins to decrease the value of a network.</p>
<p>The result is that in some networks there is an exclusion value. This is clear to anyone who has considered problems of <a href="/wiki/Authentication.html" title="Authentication">authentication</a> or <a href="/wiki/Web_of_trust.html" title="Web of trust">trust</a> on the modern internet.</p>
