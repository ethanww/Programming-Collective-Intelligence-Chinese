<dl>
<dd><small>By <a  title="User:Ral315">Ral315</a>, <a href="/wiki/September_5.html" title="September 5">5 September</a> <a href="/wiki/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a></small></dd>

<p>After a post on Wikipedia criticism site "Wikipedia Review", in which he discussed offering deleted article revisions containing personal information to an indefinitely blocked user, long-time contributor <a  title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> was desysopped on Sunday.</p>
<p><a  title="User:WordBomb">WordBomb</a>, a Wikipedia Review contributor blocked from this site, posted a thread inquiring about the article on <a href="/wiki/Gary_Weiss.html" title="Gary Weiss">Gary Weiss</a>, which was semi-protected on August 29, along with the deletion of several article revisions. In response, Everyking posted <i>"I looked for you, but when you look at deleted revisions it doesn't show you the changes (or if so I don't know how to access them). I guess I could just post the full text and you could work out the differences yourself."</i><sup id="_ref-wikireview_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>In a post on the <a  title="WP:AN">administrators' noticeboard</a>, arbitrator <a  title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a> stated: <i>"Recently it was brought to the attention of the Arbitration Committee that administrator Everyking has posted to an external site in the process of trying to determine the contents of inappropriate material, sensitive personal information, deleted from an article. Everyking looked up the deleted material using his administrator privileges, and offered to post the deleted content publicly...We view this as a serious misjudgment and a betrayal of the trust the community has given him in adminship. As such, Everyking has been immediately desysopped."</i><sup id="_ref-an_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Everyking responded almost immediately, saying <i>"This is shocking and I call for it to be overturned. I didn't actually post anything (being worried that SlimVirgin might get pissed) and even if I did I don't see how it could be a betrayal of anything."</i> When Dmcdevit mentioned his willingness to post personal information as a "liability", Everyking replied, <i>"Personal information? I didn't even know what the content was. I still don't know. I sure as hell would never post anybody's personal information."</i></p>
<p><a name="Debate" id="Debate"></a></p>
<h3>Debate</h3>
<p>Significant debate ensued on the noticeboard, with many users supporting the desysopping, and others questioning it. <a  title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> said: <i>"This was a gross and obvious violation of Administrator trust. Let us all remember that we have the power to do great harm, and we must resist the temptation to do so at all times. Private information is not ours to disclose; we only have administrator powers for one purpose: to improve Wikipedia. We cannot usually do that by publicly compromising private information."</i><sup id="_ref-an_1" class="reference"><a  title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>In defense of Everyking, <a  title="User:Phil Sandifer">Phil Sandifer</a> said: <i>"I will say, given the clearly stated suspicion on the page that the subject was a Wikipedia editor, some more care might have been in order. But honestly, I'm skeptical that this is in and of itself grounds for an emergency desysopping. It seems more like a case of the arbcom seeing an opportunity to justify a penalty they've wanted to put out for quite a while."</i><sup id="_ref-an_2" class="reference"><a  title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Everyking is allowed to attempt to regain adminship by <a  title="WP:RFA">community request</a> according to <a  class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=74002473" rel="nofollow">this</a> message sent out by <a  title="User:Sam Korn">Sam Korn</a>.</p>

<h2 style="margin-right:60px;">Sexual images spark debate</h2>
<dl>
<dd><small>By <a  title="User:Ral315">Ral315</a>, <a href="/wiki/September_5.html" title="September 5">5 September</a> <a href="/wiki/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a></small></dd>

<p>Five images uploaded by <a  title="User:Publicgirluk">Publicgirluk</a> led to debate over how appropriate the images were, and whether they were legal or not. In the end, the images were deleted and Publicgirluk was indefinitely blocked after <a  title="User:Jimbo Wales">Jimbo Wales</a> suggested that she was trolling.</p>
<p>The images were uploaded in July and August, and were used in some of Wikipedia's articles on sexuality. However, concerns were expressed about the images. One concern was the legality of the images; to comply with United States law, including the <a href="/wiki/Child_Protection_and_Obscenity_Enforcement_Act.html" title="Child Protection and Obscenity Enforcement Act">Child Protection and Obscenity Enforcement Act</a>, "sexually-explicit" images must be documented with proof that the subject of the photo was over the age of 18 when the photo was taken. The definition of "sexually-explicit", and the Act itself, are vague, leading to an uncertainty over the photos.</p>
<p>Debate on the issue started on <a  title="WP:AN/I">the administrators' incident noticeboard</a>, but was moved to a <a  title="Wikipedia:Publicgirluk photo debate">separate page</a>. <a  title="User:Cyde">Cyde</a> suggested that Publicgirluk have a picture taken of herself, holding up a sign to prove that she was the person depicted in the photo. Later, <a  title="User:Voice of All">Voice of All</a> deleted four of the images on August 27. In a later post, Publicgirluk maintained that she was over 18, that the photos were of herself, and that she had permitted them to be used; but she refused to have a photo taken of herself to prove it, believing such a move insulting. As a result, she said she no longer gave permission for any of the images to be used and wished to no longer contribute to Wikipedia.</p>
<p>After the incident, Jimbo Wales <a  class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Jimbo_Wales&amp;diff=72838894&amp;oldid=72838063" rel="nofollow">commented</a> on the incident, saying <i>""Publicgirluk" should have been indef blocked and the images speedied without so much as a how do you do."</i>. As a result, and after further discussion on the issue, Publicgirluk was blocked indefinitely by <a  title="User:Nandesuka">Nandesuka</a>. The block was removed for a short while, but reinstated by <a  title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a>.</p>

<h3>Status and community news</h3>
<p>As of <a href="/wiki/September_3.html" title="September 3">September 3</a>, <a href="/wiki/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>, the <a  class="extiw" title="it:Main_Page">Italian-language Wikipedia</a> consisted of about 192,000 articles. Since September 2005, when it counted 68,173 articles, <a href="/wiki/Italian_Wikipedia.html" title="Italian Wikipedia">Italian Wikipedia</a>'s article growth index has been 182 percent.</p>
<p>Among these, 176 articles (approximately 1 in 1090) are considered <a  class="extiw" title="it:Wikipedia:Vetrina"><i>voci di qualità</i></a> ("Voices of quality," the Italian Wikipedia equivalent for <a  title="WP:FA">featured articles</a> ). The Italian language Wikipedia as yet has no equivalent for the <a  title="WP:GA">good articles</a> page in the English or <a  class="extiw" title="de:Wikipedia:Lesenswerte_Artikel"><i>Lesenswerte Artikel</i></a> in the German Wikipedia.</p>
<p>The latest six additions to the list of <i><a  class="extiw" title="it:Wikipedia:Vetrina">voci di qualità</a></i> are <a  class="extiw" title="it:Catania">Catania</a>, <a  class="extiw" title="it:Bibliothèque_nationale_de_France">Bibliothèque nationale de France</a> (<a href="/wiki/Biblioth%C3%A8que_nationale_de_France.html" title="Bibliothèque nationale de France">National Library of France</a>), <a  class="extiw" title="it:Lalla_Fadhma">Lalla Fadhma</a>, <a  class="extiw" title="it:Adelboden">Adelboden</a>, <a  class="extiw" title="it:Campanile_di_Giotto">Campanile di Giotto</a> (<a href="/wiki/Giotto%27s_Bell_Tower.html" title="Giotto's Bell Tower">Giotto's Bell Tower</a>) and <a  class="extiw" title="it:Santa_Reparata">Santa Reparata</a>.</p>
<p>As of <a href="/wiki/September_3.html" title="September 3">September 3</a>, 2006, the total number of registered users is approximately 88,000, while active users (editors with more than 100 edits per month) is currently estimated at approximatly 300 people. 53 users of the Italian Wikipedia have been appointed as <a  class="extiw" title="it:Wikipedia:Amministratori">administrators</a>. This makes the <i>sysops</i> of it.wiki 0.06% of all users, a comparable percentage to the English (0.05%), German (0.08%) or French Wikipedias (0.08%).</p>
<p><a name="Recent_changes" id="Recent_changes"></a></p>
<h3><i>Recent changes</i></h3>
<p>Winds of change in the Italian Wikipedia community: last July the community chose a brand new layout for the <a  class="extiw" title="it:Pagina_principale">Main Page</a> that went on-line on July 20; furthermore a new structure for the <i><a  class="extiw" title="it:Wikipedia:Bar">Bar</a></i> (the Italian equivalent for the <a  title="Wikipedia:Village Pump">Village Pump</a>) has been adopted during the first days of August. There will probably be a <a  class="extiw" title="it:Wikipedia:Sondaggi">poll</a> about this new version during the first weeks of September.</p>
<p><a name="Festival_della_qualit.C3.A0" id="Festival_della_qualit.C3.A0"></a></p>
<h3><i>Festival della qualità</i></h3>
<p>Every month, the community sets up one or two <i><a  class="extiw" title="it:Wikipedia:Festival_della_qualità">Festival della qualità</a></i> (that stands for <i>Quality Festival</i>) in order to improve the quality of selected articles and pages.</p>
<p>The aim of the current <i>Festival</i> (from <a href="/wiki/August_5.html" title="August 5">August 5</a> to the end of <a href="/wiki/August.html" title="August">August</a>) is to create new quality articles concerning <a href="/wiki/Word.html" title="Word">words</a> which are commonly used in the <a href="/wiki/Italian_language.html" title="Italian language">Italian language</a>. Up to <a href="/wiki/August_22.html" title="August 22">August 22</a>, 61 new articles of this kind have been written. This is a good result, considering that the month of August is commonly the height of vacation period in Italy (lots of wikipedians are still in "Wikipause").</p>
<p>The previous <i>Festival</i> (held from <a href="/wiki/July_20.html" title="July 20">July 20</a> to <a href="/wiki/August_3.html" title="August 3">August 3</a>) was dedicated to the articles tagged as <i><a  class="extiw" title="it:Categoria:Da_wikificare">da wikificare</a></i> (<a  title="Category:Articles that need to be wikified">articles that need to be wikified</a> in en.wiki). As a result of that festival 785 articles were <i>wikified</i>.</p>
<p><a name="Prizes" id="Prizes"></a></p>
<h3>Prizes</h3>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/December_14.html" title="December 14">December 14</a>, <a href="/wiki/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>, the Italian Wikipedia has been awarded with 2 <i><a  class="external text" title="http://premiowww.ilsole24ore.com/premiowww/regolamento.shtml?sez=4" rel="nofollow">premi WWW</a></i> (WWW prizes) by the Italian financial <a href="/wiki/Newspaper.html" title="Newspaper">newspaper</a> <a href="/wiki/Il_Sole_24_Ore.html" title="Il Sole 24 Ore">Il Sole 24 Ore</a>. The first prize was for the <i>Istruzione e Lavoro</i> (<i>Educational and Work</i>) category, for being <i>the new landmark in Italy for online knowledge.</i> The second prize was for the <i>Internet Educational</i> category because <i>it is a free encylopedia, made by a collective intelligence, enhancing knowledge dissemination and its free access</i>.</p>
<p><a name="Media_reports" id="Media_reports"></a></p>
<h3>Media reports</h3>
<p>The Italian Wikipedia is often quoted on Italian media, as shown in the <i><a  class="extiw" title="it:Wikipedia:Rassegna_stampa">Rassegna stampa</a></i> page (same as the en.wiki <a  title="Wikipedia:Press coverage">Press coverage</a>). In recent months, Italian media has increased it.wp's coverage and interviewed some of its administrators. The last interview of an Italian <i>sysop</i> has been broadcast, on <a href="/wiki/August_14.html" title="August 14">August 14</a>, by <a href="/wiki/Rai_Uno.html" title="Rai Uno">Rai Uno</a>, the main channel of <a href="/wiki/RAI.html" title="RAI">RAI</a>, the Italian public broadcasting company.</p>

<h3>Wikimedia Italia Meeting 2006 and <i>Wikiraduni</i></h3>
<p>The second Wikimedia Italia Meeting took place on <a href="/wiki/September_2.html" title="September 2">September 2</a> and <a href="/wiki/September_3.html" title="September 3">3</a> in <a href="/wiki/Valentano.html" title="Valentano">Valentano</a>, near <a href="/wiki/Viterbo.html" title="Viterbo">Viterbo</a>. During the meeting, members of <a  class="external text" title="http://www.wikimedia.it" rel="nofollow">Wikimedia Italia</a> (the Italian local chapter of the <a  class="external text" title="http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Home" rel="nofollow">Wikimedia Foundation</a>) renewed social charges and approved the yearly budget of the association.</p>
<p>This "official" meeting is not the only one for Italian contributors. Actually, they meet each other quite often: the last <i><a  class="extiw" title="it:Wikipedia:Raduni">Wikiraduno</a></i> (<i><a  title="Wikipedia:Meetups">Wikipedia:Meetups</a></i>) took place in <a  class="extiw" title="it:Wikipedia:Raduni/Milano_2006_agosto">Milan</a> on <a href="/wiki/August_6.html" title="August 6">August 6</a>. Other remarkable <i>Wikiraduni</i> that took place during last spring and summer were in <a  class="extiw" title="it:Wikipedia:Raduni/Piacenza_2006">Piacenza</a>, <a href="/wiki/Zurich.html" title="Zurich">Zurich</a>, <a  class="extiw" title="it:Wikipedia:Raduni/Vicenza_2006">Vicenza</a>, <a  class="extiw" title="it:Wikipedia:Raduni/Genova_2006">Genova</a> and <a  class="extiw" title="it:Wikipedia:Raduni/Bologna_2006">Bologna</a>, some of them as part of bigger meetings or conventions.</p>
<p><a name="Other_projects" id="Other_projects"></a></p>
<h3>Other projects</h3>
<p>Apart from the Wikipedia, there are several Wikimedia projects in Italian language. They are <a  class="external text" title="http://it.wikinews.org" rel="nofollow">Wikinotizie</a> (like <a  class="external text" title="http://en.wikinews.org" rel="nofollow">Wikinews</a> in English), <a  class="external text" title="http://it.wikisource.org" rel="nofollow">Wikisource</a>, <a  class="external text" title="http://species.wikimedia.org/wiki/Pagina_principale" rel="nofollow">Wikispecies</a>, <a  class="external text" title="http://it.wikiquote.org" rel="nofollow">Wikiquote</a>, <a  class="external text" title="http://it.wikibooks.org" rel="nofollow">Wikibooks</a>, <a  class="external text" title="http://it.wiktionary.org" rel="nofollow">Wikizionario</a> (like <a  class="external text" title="http://en.wiktionary.org" rel="nofollow">Wiktionary</a> in English).</p>
<p>There are also a large number of <i>younger sisters</i> of the Italian Wikipedia, like Wikipedias in <a  class="extiw" title="frp:">Arpitano</a>, <a  class="extiw" title="ca:">Catalano</a>, <a  class="extiw" title="co:">Corso</a>, <a  class="extiw" title="fur:">Friulano</a>, <a  class="extiw" title="la:">Latino</a>, <a  class="extiw" title="lij:">Ligure</a>, <a  class="extiw" title="lmo:">Lombardo</a>, <a  class="extiw" title="nap:">Napoletano</a>, <a  class="extiw" title="pms:">Piemontese</a>, <a  class="extiw" title="rm:">Romancio</a>, <a  class="extiw" title="sc:">Sardo</a>, <a  class="extiw" title="scn:">Siciliano</a>, and <a  class="extiw" title="vec:">Veneto</a> languages.

Administrators, compared with the trends of articles, edits, and total users.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/September_2.html" title="September 2">2 September</a>, Wikipedia reached another important milestone when <a  title="User:Angela">Angela</a> promoted <a  title="User:Xyrael">Xyrael</a>&#160;(<a  title="Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Xyrael">nom</a>) to <a  title="Wikipedia:Administrators">admin status</a>. This marked the 1000th administrator on the English Wikipedia, a number which has doubled in little over a year (<i>see chart, left</i>). Xyrael was nominated for adminship by <a  title="User:Petros471">Petros471</a> and was supported by 54 Wikipedians.</p>
<p>Xyrael's promotion marked the 1000th administrator on the English Wikipedia, giving approximately<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a  title="">[3]</a></sup> one administrator for every 1,377 articles and 2,197 registered users. Furthermore, there is one administrator for every 111 users who have made at least ten contributions, according to <a  class="external text" title="http://stats.wikimedia.org/EN/TablesWikipediaEN.htm" rel="nofollow">Erik Zachte's Wikipedia Statistics website</a>, which was last updated using June 2006 statistics.</p>
<p><a  title="User:Nae'blis">Nae'blis</a> pointed out on the <a  title="Wikipedia talk:Requests for adminship">requests for adminship talk page</a> that there are between 35 and 40 former administrators, so the English Wikipedia probably passed 1,000 administrators ever promoted sometime in mid-July. However, this is the first time that there have been 1,000 user accounts with admin access at the same time.</p>
<p>Upon his promotion, Xyrael said: "The fact that we've broken the barrier of one thousand sysops is far more exciting for the community than the promotion of myself. I'm happy to think that we've continued to develop the number of people who have the deep interest in Wikipedia that administrators do enough to reach this figure. Wikipedia is growing and changing every day and this is how it should be. We can always improve, and I hope that I live up to your expectations as an admin."</p>

<h3>Administrator count on other Wikipedias</h3>
<p>The Wikipedia with the second-highest admin count is the German Wikipedia, with <a  class="external text" title="http://de.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Spezial:Listusers&amp;group=sysop&amp;limit=250&amp;offset=0" rel="nofollow">225 admins</a>. Third and fourth place belongs to the French Wikipedia, with <a  class="external text" title="http://fr.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Listusers&amp;group=sysop&amp;limit=250&amp;offset=0" rel="nofollow">109 admins</a>, and the Polish Wikipedia, with <a  class="external text" title="http://pl.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Specjalna:Listusers&amp;group=sysop&amp;limit=100&amp;offset=0" rel="nofollow">98 admins</a>, respectively.</p>

<h2 style="margin-right:60px;">Voting begins in Board elections</h2>
<dl>
<dd><small>By <a  title="User:Flcelloguy">Flcelloguy</a>, <a href="/wiki/September_5.html" title="September 5">September 5</a>, <a href="/wiki/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a></small></dd>

<p><a  title="Special:Boardvote">Voting</a> in the <a  class="extiw" title="m:Elections_for_the_Board_of_Trustees_of_the_Wikimedia_Foundation,_2006/En">Board of Trustees elections</a> started this week. The voting, which will run until September 21, began on Friday and uses <a href="/wiki/Approval_voting.html" title="Approval voting">approval voting</a>, where each voter can vote for an unlimited number of candidates.</p>
<p>There were also a number of changes in the <a  class="extiw" title="m:Election_candidates_2006/En">field of candidates</a> late last week, which were only added to the <i>Signpost'</i>s <a  title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia Signpost/2006-08-28/Board candidates">coverage</a> after press time. Two candidates, <a  class="extiw" title="m:User:Cerejota">Cerejota</a> and <a  class="extiw" title="m:User:NicholasTurnbull">NicholasTurnbull</a>, were disqualified from the race prior to the start of voting by general counsel and interim executive director <a  title="User:BradPatrick">Brad Patrick</a> because they had not confirmed themselves by providing required paperwork and identification to the Wikimedia Foundation office. In addition, there were also several candidate entries in the hours before the deadline, and one candidate, <a  class="extiw" title="m:User:Hadraj">Hadraj</a>, also withdrew from the race, bringing the final number of candidates in the elections to 17. All but one of the candidates had also responded to the "interview" questions the <i>Signpost</i> asked, and their replies were subsequently added to <a  title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia Signpost/2006-08-28/Board candidates">last week's article</a>. The only candidate not to reply yet was <a  class="extiw" title="m:User:Linuxbeak">Linuxbeak</a>, who cited that "several severe situations" had come up, preventing him from finishing his replies. The <i>Signpost</i> will update the candidates' responses when his reply is received.</p>
<p>Two new <a  class="extiw" title="m:Election_officials_2006/En">election officials</a> were also appointed this week. A <a  class="external text" title="http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Resolution:election_officials2" rel="nofollow">resolution</a> by the current Board, passed with supporting votes from Michael Davis, <a  title="User:Angela">Angela Beesley</a>, and <a  title="User:Anthere">Florence Nibart-Devouard</a>, confirmed that <a  class="extiw" title="m:User:Jdforrester">James Forrester</a> and <a  class="extiw" title="m:User:Jon_Harald_Søby">Jon Harald Søby</a> were to become assistant election officials immediately, joining <a  class="extiw" title="m:User:Aphaia">Aphaia</a>, <a  class="extiw" title="m:User:Datrio">Datrio</a>, and <a  class="extiw" title="m:User:Essjay">Essjay</a> as election officials. Aphaia is also an assistant election official, while Datrio and Essjay are officially inspectors of the election. According to the resolution, the appointments were aimed to reduce the current workload of the officials, at least one of whom has become inactive publicly over the past few weeks.</p>
<p>An announcement by the election officials also clarified several issues relating to suffrage before the voting started. The <a  class="extiw" title="m:Elections_for_the_Board_of_Trustees_of_the_Wikimedia_Foundation,_2006/En">notice</a> amended the suffrage requirements, which state that a user must have at least 400 edits on one Wikimedia project prior to <a href="/wiki/August_1.html" title="August 1">August 1</a>, <a href="/wiki/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> and have started contributing 90 days prior to that date, by defining whether or not blocked users may vote. Users banned or blocked indefinitely from any Wikimedia project may not vote, but those blocked on a certain project may vote on another project where they are eligible or vote after their block expires or is removed, if voting is still ongoing. This clarification, according to the officials, does not change any of the previous requirements but instead puts in writing the "oral tradition" that has been used for several elections.</p>
<p>Voting for the most part ran smoothly, even though there was initially some confusion from a limited number of users about where to vote, stemming from the fact that all the election pages are located in <a  class="extiw" title="m:Main_Page">Meta</a>. As of September 2, according to <a  class="extiw" title="m:Elections_statistics">statistics</a> compiled by <a  class="extiw" title="m:User:ArnoLagrange">ArnoLagrange</a> from the public <a  title="Special:Boardvote/list">list</a> of voters, there were nearly 700 votes already, with approximately a third of those votes coming from the English Wikipedia. More recent <a  class="extiw" title="m:User:Digitalme/Elections_statistics">statistics</a> compiled by <a  class="extiw" title="m:User:Digitalme">Digitalme</a> on September 6 show 1347 votes, with around 43% coming from the English Wikipedia.</p>

<p><a name="Closed_cases" id="Closed_cases"></a></p>
<h3>Closed cases</h3>
<ul>
<li><b><a  title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Ericsaindon2">Ericsaindon2</a>:</b> Closed on Sunday after one and a half months, a case involving the actions of <a  title="User:Ericsaindon2">Ericsaindon2</a>, <a  title="User:Coolcaesar">Coolcaesar</a> and <a  title="User:Will Beback">Will Beback</a>. Coolcaesar claimed that Ericsaindon2 had tried to insert original research, had disrupted Wikipedia, used sockpuppets, uploaded images violating copyright law, and failed to assume good faith. In response, Ericsaindon2 claimed that Coolcaesar had contributed equally to the dispute, and that Will Beback had misused admin powers, in particular with incorrect and biased application of the <a  title="WP:3RR">3RR</a>. Ericsaindon2 was restricted to one account, banned for one year, and placed on Probation.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b><a  title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Israeli apartheid">Israeli apartheid</a>:</b> Closed on Saturday after two months, a case involving the actions of editors and administrators on <a href="/wiki/Allegations_of_Israeli_apartheid.html" title="Allegations of Israeli apartheid">Allegations of Israeli apartheid</a> (formerly at <a href="/wiki/Israeli_apartheid.html" title="Israeli apartheid">Israeli apartheid</a>). The article was the site of a move war during a poll to determine the article's naming. Remedies were passed encouraging negotiation and mediation, admonishing administrators involved in the dispute, directing discussion of issues to <a  title="Wikipedia:Central discussions/Apartheid">Wikipedia:Central discussions/Apartheid</a>, and granting an amnesty to all users except <a  title="User:Zeq">Zeq</a>, who remained banned from the article.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b><a  title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Eternal Equinox">Eternal Equinox</a>:</b> Closed on Wednesday after two months, a case involving <a  title="User:Eternal Equinox">Eternal Equinox</a>. Several users complained that Eternal Equinox had been trying to claim <a  title="Wikipedia:Ownership of articles">ownership of articles</a> with edit wars and abuse directed at those who tried to edit them. Eternal Equinox claimed to have left Wikipedia, but the other parties argued that this was not credible because of a number of similar statements made previously. Eternal Equinox had since returned, editing anonymously from several related IP addresses while acknowledging his or her identity. Eternal Equinox was placed on probation and personal attack parole, and <a  title="User:Jim62sch">Jim62sch</a> was cautioned to "avoid teasing or taunting sensitive users".</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b><a  title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Añoranza">Añoranza</a>:</b> Closed on Tuesday after two months, a case involving <a  title="User:Añoranza">Añoranza</a>. Users asserted that Añoranza had been incivil, and had filed a retaliatory <a  title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Zer0faults">request for comment</a> and <a  title="Wikipedia:Requests for checkuser/Case/Zer0faults">request for checkuser</a>. The dispute involved the usage of terms such as "Operation Iraqi Liberation" for the <a href="/wiki/2003_invasion_of_Iraq.html" title="2003 invasion of Iraq">2003 invasion of Iraq</a>. Añoranza was banned for one week for the disruptive way in which he went about bringing the terms to light and the parties were encouraged to enter into good-faith negotiations into the matter.</li>
</ul>
<p><a name="New_case" id="New_case"></a></p>
<h3>New case</h3>
<ul>
<li><b><a  title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Ackoz">Ackoz</a>:</b> A case involving the actions and community ban of <a  title="User:Ackoz">Ackoz</a>, and his later account, <a  title="User:Azmoc">Azomc</a>. The user previously contributed to Wikipedia under the name Ackoz, but, after being banned for three days, elected to leave. After a while, he decided to return, and admits to "some trolling" since then. However, he has stated that were he unblocked, he would cease his disruptive behaviour, and would be prepared to undergo mentorship. Some administrators, however, believe that he should nonetheless remain blocked.</li>

<h3>Evidence phase</h3>
<ul>
<li><b><a  title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Marudubshinki">Marudubshinki</a>:</b> A case involving the actions of <a  title="User:Marudubshinki">Marudubshinki</a>. <a  title="User:Snottygobble">Snottygobble</a>, <a  title="User:I@n">I@n</a> and others allege that Marudubshinki has operated an unauthorised bot, and misused his sysop powers by unblocking himself and allowing his bot to delete pages. Marudubshinki has not presented a statement in his defence.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b><a  title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/MONGO">MONGO</a>:</b> A case involving the actions of <a  title="User:MONGO">MONGO</a>, <a  title="User:Rootology">rootology</a>, and others.

</ul>
<p><a name="Voting_phase" id="Voting_phase"></a></p>
<h3>Voting phase</h3>
<ul>
<li><b><a  title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Ed Poor 2">Ed Poor 2</a>:</b> A case involving <a  title="User:Ed Poor">Ed Poor</a>. <a  title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> and <a  title="User:Consumed Crustacean">Consumed Crustacean</a> have accused Poor of POV pushing and disruption; Poor has not introduced evidence in the case. Ed Poor was party to two prior cases; the <a  title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Ed Poor">first</a> was closed after Poor resigned his status as a <a  title="Wikipedia:Bureaucrats">bureaucrat</a>, and the <a  title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/FuelWagon v. Ed Poor">second</a> resulted in his desysopping. Fred Bauder has proposed a remedy placing him on probation, but no other arbitrators have yet commented.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b><a  title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Pat8722">Pat8722</a>:</b> A case involving the actions of <a  title="User:Pat8722">Pat8722</a>. <a  title="User:BorgHunter">BorgHunter</a> has accused Pat8722 of edit-warring. Pat8722 has requested that the ArbCom stay the case while he pursues 6 <i>pro se</i> cases in the American courts, and has agreed not to edit Wikipedia in the interim. Fred Bauder has proposed a motion establishing the principle of a "continuance", and a remedy extending this to Pat8722. However, no other arbitrators have yet commented on the matter.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b><a  title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/St Christopher">St Christopher</a>:</b> A case involving <a href="/wiki/St_Christopher_Iba_Mar_Diop_College_of_Medicine.html" title="St Christopher Iba Mar Diop College of Medicine">St Christopher Iba Mar Diop College of Medicine</a>, a school whose accreditation status is in dispute, and in particular the behaviour of <a  title="User:ParalelUni">ParalelUni</a> on the page. Dmcdevit has proposed remedies affirming the community ban of ParalelUni, and banning all single-purpose accounts from editing the article, which have been supported by Fred Bauder.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b><a  title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Kehrli">Kehrli</a>:</b> A case involving the actions of <a  title="User:Nick Y.">Nick Y</a> and <a  title="User:Kehrli">Kherli</a> on <a href="/wiki/Mass-to-charge_ratio.html" title="Mass-to-charge ratio">Mass-to-charge ratio</a> and related articles. Both protagonists accuse each other of POV pushing, adding unsourced information, and adding dispute tags without reason. Fred Bauder has proposed remedies banning Kehrli from articles relating to <a href="/wiki/M/z.html" title="M/z">M/z</a>, and from changing the notation <i>m/z</i> where found to any other notation.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b><a  title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Israel-Lebanon">Israel-Lebanon</a>:</b> A case involving the actions of <a  title="User:AdamKesher">AdamKesher</a>, <a  title="User:Tasc">Tasc</a> and others on <a href="/wiki/2006_Israel-Lebanon_conflict.html" title="2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict">2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict</a>. AdamKesher accuses Tasc of removing relevant external links which satisfy <a  title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a>, and he denies the allegation. In response, <a  title="User:Denis Diderot">Denis Diderot</a> accuses Kesher of "using Wikipedia as a tool to promote his POV". Fred Bauder has proposed remedies permitting the linking to blogs which offer contemporary comment on a current event from Wikipedia pages, cautioning all editors to use common sense above literal interpretation of Wikipedia policy, and permitting any editor "particularly Tasc", to be banned from the article for an "appropriate period" should they engage in edit warring on the issue. These proposals have yet to be commented on.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b><a  title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Deir Yassin massacre">Deir Yassin massacre</a>:</b> A case involving the actions of <a  title="User:KimvdLinde">KimvdLinde</a> and <a  title="User:Guy Montag">Guy Montag</a> on <a href="/wiki/Deir_Yassin_massacre.html" title="Deir Yassin massacre">Deir Yassin massacre</a>. KimvdLinde alleges that Montag has violated his <a  title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Yuber">probation</a> by rewriting the article, unilaterally moving it to "Battle of Deir Yassin", violating copyright and votestacking. In return, Montag refuses "to participate in any of these proceedings", and alleges that KimvdLinde has abused her admin tools by exercising them in a dispute in which she is involved. Fred Bauder has proposed remedies banning Montag from articles relating to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and suggested that Montag's probation be extended. These remedies have attracted the support of three other arbitrators.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b><a  title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Warren Kinsella">Warren Kinsella</a>:</b> A case involving the actions of <a  title="User:Arthur Ellis">Arthur Ellis</a>, <a  title="User:Pete Peters">Pete Peters</a> and others on the <a href="/wiki/Warren_Kinsella.html" title="Warren Kinsella">Warren Kinsella</a> article. Both users accuse the other of disruptive edits on the page, and Peters and others acccuse Ellis of sockpuppetry using anon accounts, while Ellis alleges that administrators dealt inequitably with him and Peters. Fred Bauder has proposed remedies banning Ellis indefinitely from all articles relating to "Canadian politics and its blogosphere", and limiting him to one account. Charles Matthews has indicated his support for these proposals.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b><a  title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Zer0faults">Zer0faults</a>:</b> A case involving the actions of <a  title="User:Zer0faults">Zer0faults</a> and <a  title="User:Nescio">Nescio</a> on <a  title="Template:War on Terrorism">Template:War on Terrorism</a>, <a href="/wiki/War_on_Terror.html" title="War on Terror">War on Terror</a> and related arguments. Nescio alleges that Zer0faults has engaged in violation of <a  title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>, disruptive editing, and "uncivil remarks". In return, Zer0faults alleges that Nescio has failed to <a  title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a>, violated <a  title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> and <a  title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, and failed to provide explanations for his reverts. A single remedy that would place Zer0faults on probation was proposed by <a  title="User:Fred Bauder">Fred Bauder</a>, and has the support of three arbitrators.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b><a  title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Intangible">Intangible</a>:</b> A case involving the actions of <a  title="User:Intangible">Intangible</a>. <a  title="User:Cberlet">Cberlet</a> alleges that Intangible has used an "aggressive and confrontational" editing style to push his POV (partly through the wholesale deletion of the term "far right" from numerous pages), making sweeping edits and reverts with little or no discussion, and being "contentious and confrontational" in talk page discussions. Intangible vigorously denies the allegations. A remedy, supported by six arbitrators, would place Intangible on probation. Other remedies, proposed by Dmcdevit, and supported by two and three arbitrators respectively, but opposed by Fred Bauder, would also place <a  title="User:Tazmaniacs">Tazmaniacs</a> and <a  class="new" title="User:AaronS">AaronS</a> on probation.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b><a  title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Sathya Sai Baba">Sathya Sai Baba</a>:</b> A case involving <a  title="User:Andries">Andries</a> and <a  title="User:SSS108">SSS108</a>'s actions on the article <a href="/wiki/Sathya_Sai_Baba.html" title="Sathya Sai Baba">Sathya Sai Baba</a>. Both have accused each other of "POV pushing", and violating Wikipedia's policy on <a  title="WP:NOR">original research</a>. Proposed remedies that unsourced or poorly sourced information be removed from these articles, and a complete amnesty for Andries and SSS108 for any unreliable information they may have added in the past have the support of five arbitrators.</li>
