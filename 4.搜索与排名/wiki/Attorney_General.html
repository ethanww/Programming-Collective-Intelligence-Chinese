			<p>In most <a href="/wiki/Common_law.html" title="Common law">common law</a> jurisdictions, the <b>Attorney General</b> or <b>Attorney-General</b> is the main legal adviser to the government, and in some jurisdictions may in addition have executive responsibility for law enforcement or responsibility for public prosecutions.</p>
<p>The term has traditionally been used to refer to any person who holds a general power of attorney to represent a principal in all matters. In the common law tradition, anyone who represents the state, especially in criminal prosecutions, is such an attorney. Although a government may designate some official as the permanent attorney general, anyone who comes to represent the state in the same way, even if only for a particular case, is an attorney general, and when that is a private individual, he may be distinguished from the permanent official as being a private or <i>pro tempore</i> attorney general. Although most nations now mainly use full-time professional prosecutors in criminal cases, this is a fairly recent development, emerging in the latter half of the 19th century. Until the advent of public prosecutors, in the United States commonly called district attorneys at the county or district level, criminal prosecutions were conducted by private persons, usually lawyers, who would be appointed attorney general by receiving a bill of indictment from a <a href="/wiki/Grand_jury.html" title="Grand jury">grand jury</a>. Today private criminal prosecutions are discouraged by judges, but the practice survives in the use of "special prosecutors" or "independent counsel" created by special legislation.</p>
<p>This usage can also be seen in the title "secretary general", for a secretary, or executive official, with general authority, normally the chief executive of a hierarchy of executive officials, or "surgeon general", for the chief surgeon of a team of surgeons.</p>
<p>Some people mistakenly think the word "general" used in that way entitles the official to the honorific "general", but this is only appropriate for military generals.</p>

<h2>Australia</h2>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australia</a> the <a href="/wiki/Attorney-General_of_Australia.html" title="Attorney-General of Australia">Attorney-General</a> is the chief law officer of the <a href="/wiki/Queen_of_Australia.html" title="Queen of Australia">Crown</a> and a member of the <a href="/wiki/Cabinet_of_Australia.html" title="Cabinet of Australia">Cabinet</a>. The Attorney-General is the minister responsible for legal affairs, national and public security and the <a href="/wiki/Australian_Security_Intelligence_Organisation.html" title="Australian Security Intelligence Organisation">Australian Security Intelligence Organisation</a>. The current Attorney-General, as of 2006, is <a href="/wiki/Phillip_Ruddock.html" title="Phillip Ruddock">Phillip Ruddock</a>.</p>
<p>The Justice and Customs Minister is the minister assisting the Attorney-General. The current Minister is Senator <a href="/wiki/Chris_Ellison.html" title="Chris Ellison">Chris Ellison</a>. The Justice and Customs Minister is responsible for the <a href="/wiki/Australian_Federal_Police.html" title="Australian Federal Police">Australian Federal Police</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Australian_Customs_Service.html" title="Australian Customs Service">Australian Customs Service</a>.</p>
<p>The Australian states each have an Attorney-General, who is a state minister with similar responsibilities to the federal minister with respect to state law.</p>
<p>Functions of the state and federal Attorneys-General include the administration of the selection of persons for nomination to judicial posts, and authorising prosecutions. In normal circumstances the prosecutorial powers of the Attorney-General are exercised by the <a href="/wiki/Director_of_Public_Prosecutions.html" title="Director of Public Prosecutions">Director of Public Prosecutions</a> and staff, however the Attorney-General maintains formal control, including the power to initiate and terminate public prosecutions and take over private prosecutions. Statutory criminal law provides that prosecutions for certain offences require the individual consent of the Attorney-General. This is generally for offences whose illegality is of a somewhat controversial nature, or where there is perceived to be a significant risk that prosecutions of a political nature may be embarked upon. The Attorney-General also generally has the power to issue certificates legally conclusive of certain facts (e.g. that the revelation of certain matters in court proceedings might constitute a risk to national security); the facts stated in such certificates must be accepted by the courts and cannot legally be disputed by any parties. The Attorney-General also has the power to issue a <a href="/wiki/Nolle_prosequi.html" title="Nolle prosequi">nolle prosequi</a> with respect to a case, which authoritatively determines that the state (in whose name prosecutions are brought) does not wish to prosecute the case, so preventing any person from doing so.</p>

<h2>Brazil</h2>
<p>In Brazil the Attorney General, known as the Procurador Geral da República, is the head of the federal prosecution service, Ministério Público Federal, organ also known as the Procuradoria Geral da República, an autonomous organ in charge of criminal prosecution, the defence of minorities' interests, the environment, and the protection of constitutional values. The Attorney General heads a group of independent magistrates who work to investigate and prosecute criminal and civil offenses committed against society and, specially, against racial, sexual, religious and political minorities or the environment. The task of advising the President, head of the Executive Branch, is left to the Advocate General, office in charge of defending the federal government, and the Minister of Justice, a cabinet member who is in charge of the federal police, amongst other duties, organ which investigating activities are overseen by federal prosecutors (Procuradores da República) in the Attorney General's office. Since Brazil is a Federation, in every state there is a local prosecution organ, the Procuradoria Geral de Justiça do Estado (State Attorney General), with the same attributions, at a local level, of the federal organ. A State prosecutor is called Promotor de Justiça. Both federal and state prosecutors are public servants who start working after approval in public exams.</p>
