<p>Shakespeare's play tells the story of the legendary Danish Prince Hamlet, or Amleth (see: <a href="/wiki/Hamlet_%28legend%29.html" title="Hamlet (legend)">the legendary Hamlet</a>) whose exploits were recorded by <a href="/wiki/Saxo_Grammaticus.html" title="Saxo Grammaticus">Saxo Grammaticus</a> in his <i><a href="/wiki/Gesta_Danorum.html" title="Gesta Danorum">Gesta Danorum</a></i> around 1200 AD; <a href="/wiki/Fran%C3%A7ois_de_Belleforest.html" title="François de Belleforest">François de Belleforest</a> adapted Saxo's story in his <i>Histoires Tragiques</i> (1570).</p>
<p>Shakespeare's main source, however, is believed to be an earlier play about Hamlet (known as the <i><a href="/wiki/Ur-Hamlet.html" title="Ur-Hamlet">Ur-Hamlet</a></i>), which is attributed to <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Kyd.html" title="Thomas Kyd">Thomas Kyd</a> and is known to have introduced a ghost to the story. The 'Ur-<i>Hamlet'</i> was never printed, and is now lost. However, it was praised in print in <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Nashe.html" title="Thomas Nashe">Thomas Nashe</a>'s preface to <a href="/wiki/Robert_Greene.html" title="Robert Greene">Robert Greene</a>'s <i><a  class="new" title="Menaphon">Menaphon</a></i> as early as 1589. It made the phrase "Hamlet, revenge!" (which does not appear in Shakespeare's play) famous. While the Ur-<i>Hamlet</i> is usually assumed to have been written by Kyd, it is sometimes suggested that it may have been written by Shakespeare himself, and later revised or rewritten into the play as it has been preserved in print.</p>
<p>Shakespeare may also have taken some elements from Kyd's other play, <i><a href="/wiki/The_Spanish_Tragedy.html" title="The Spanish Tragedy">The Spanish Tragedy</a></i>, especially the hero's <a href="/wiki/Procrastination.html" title="Procrastination">procrastination</a>.</p>

<h2>Texts</h2>
<p>There are three extant texts of <i>Hamlet</i> from the early 1600s: two quarto editions, and one from the first folio (see <a href="/wiki/Folios_and_Quartos_%28Shakespeare%29.html" title="Folios and Quartos (Shakespeare)">Quarto and Folio</a>).</p>
<div class="thumb tright">

The first quarto's rendering of the 'To be or not to be' speech</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The play first appeared in print in 1603 in a version now known as the 'bad Quarto'. This edition follows essentially the same plot as the play we know as <i>Hamlet</i> but it is much shorter and its language is often different to that which we are accustomed to encounter; for example, where the accepted version reads "To be or not to be, that is the question", the 1603 Quarto reads "To be or not to be, aye there's the point". These discrepancies, which many critics view as aesthetically weaker than the other versions, have led to the suggestion that the text may have been published without the permission of the playing company, and put together by <a href="/wiki/Shorthand.html" title="Shorthand">stenography</a> or by minor actors recalling the lines of others by memory. It was common practise at the time for actors in rehearsal to be given only their individual part and cue lines; consequently, the finger has been pointed at the actor playing Marcellus as the likely culprit for the source of the "Bad Quarto", as his scenes and lines are rendered most "accurately" compared to other characters. When he is absent from the stage the text seems more divergent from other extant copies. Some modern textual scholars consider this theory to be fanciful, since a minor actor would be unlikely to have memorised the lines of other actors, even inaccurately — but actors and other theatrical professionals would likely dispute this point, since these workers often unintentionally memorize large portions of plays that they work on. On the other hand, Albert Weiner has argued that the 'bad Quarto' version is not a corruption but an intentional, purposeful, and skillful abridgement of the play, to enable the King's Men to take it on the road with a far smaller complement of actors than would be required to stage the "full version". Additionally, the language was simplified in order to appeal to an audience less sophisticated than that found in London. This theory has not been widely accepted.</p>
<p>The authorized 'Second Quarto' (Q2) was published in 1604, and was described on its title page as "enlarged to almost as much again as it was". This is the longest text of <i>Hamlet</i> to be published in the period.</p>
<p>The third edition was the version published in the <a href="/wiki/First_Folio.html" title="First Folio">First Folio</a> of Shakespeare's complete works. This text is shorter but also contains scenes not in Q2.</p>
<p>Modern editions are a compromise between the Second Quarto text and the Folio text. Some conflate the two to produce one very long text. Others assume that the Folio text represents Shakespeare's final intentions and that the cuts were made by him; they therefore present the cut Q2 passages in an appendix.</p>
<p>In the theatre, performing the full, conflated Q2/Folio text takes around 4 hours. Because of this, most productions use a cut text. For example, the <a href="/wiki/Royal_Shakespeare_Company.html" title="Royal Shakespeare Company">Royal Shakespeare Company</a>'s Artistic Director <a  class="new" title="Michael Boyd">Michael Boyd</a> staged Hamlet in the summer of 2004 using lines from various Quartos; his text was dubbed the "Boyd Quarto" by newspaper reviewers.</p>
<p>Some theatre companies have experimented with performing the Bad Quarto, which takes only 2 hours. They claim that while it reads badly on the page, in performance it is faster-paced and more direct than the 'official' versions.</p>

<h2>Main characters</h2>
<p><b><a href="/wiki/Hamlet#Hamlet_as_a_character.html" title="Hamlet">Prince Hamlet</a></b>, the title character, is the son of the late <a href="/wiki/King_Hamlet.html" title="King Hamlet">King of Denmark</a>, who was also named Hamlet. He is a student at a school in <a href="/wiki/Martin_Luther_University_of_Halle-Wittenberg.html" title="Martin Luther University of Halle-Wittenberg">Wittenberg</a>. He is charged by the ghost of his father to avenge his murder, which he finally succeeds in doing, but only after the rest of the royal house has been wiped out and he himself has been mortally wounded with a poisoned <a href="/wiki/Rapier.html" title="Rapier">rapier</a> by Laertes at the end of the play.</p>
<p><b><a href="/wiki/King_Claudius.html" title="King Claudius">Claudius</a></b> is the current King of Denmark, Hamlet's uncle, who succeeded to the throne upon the death of his brother. The ghost of King Hamlet tells Prince Hamlet that he was murdered by brother Claudius, who poured <a href="/wiki/Hebenon.html" title="Hebenon">hebenon</a> in his ear while he was asleep. Claudius is killed with a poisoned rapier by Hamlet. Claudius also accidentally kills Gertrude, his wife and Hamlet's mother, with the draught he actually had intended to poison Hamlet with at the end of the play.</p>
<p><b><a href="/wiki/King_Hamlet.html" title="King Hamlet">King Hamlet</a></b> (referred to in the stage directions as <b>Ghost</b>) was Hamlet's father. At the start of the play, it has not been long since his death. He appears to Hamlet as a <a href="/wiki/Ghost.html" title="Ghost">ghost</a> seeking vengeance for his murder by poison at the hands of his brother, Claudius. Hamlet questions the contention that the spirit really is the ghost of King Hamlet or is actually a malicious demon in disguise. He cannot find a definitive answer until <i>The Murder of Gonzago</i> is performed by the Players.</p>
<p><b><a href="/wiki/Gertrude_%28Hamlet%29.html" title="Gertrude (Hamlet)">Gertrude</a></b> is Hamlet's mother. Widowed because of King Hamlet's death, she has quickly been remarried to Claudius, the late king's brother, a relationship considered <a href="/wiki/Incest.html" title="Incest">incestuous</a> by Hamlet and in Shakespeare's time (although religious authorities could and did grant dispensations for such marriages). She dies by drinking poisoned wine intended for Hamlet at the end of the play.</p>
<p><b><a href="/wiki/Polonius.html" title="Polonius">Polonius</a></b> is Claudius's chief councillor, who is distrustful of Hamlet's relationship with Ophelia, his own daughter, because she is a social inferior to him. He fears Hamlet will only take her virginity and won't marry her, so he forbids her from continuing with their relationship. He is sometimes portrayed as a fatuous bore, and Hamlet frequently teases him while pretending to be mad. He is fatally stabbed by Hamlet, who mistakes him for Claudius, when he hides himself behind an arras while trying to eavesdrop on a conversation between Hamlet and his mother.</p>
<p><b><a href="/wiki/Laertes_%28character%29.html" title="Laertes (character)">Laertes</a></b> is Polonius's son, who deeply cares for Ophelia, his sister, and spends much of the play in France. In the end, appalled by Hamlet's role in his sister's death, he works with Claudius to rig a duelling contest. In this contest, he kills Hamlet with a poisoned <a href="/wiki/Rapier.html" title="Rapier">rapier</a> to avenge the deaths of Polonius and Ophelia. Hamlet kills him with the same rapier, without realising that it was poisoned.</p>
<p><b><a href="/wiki/Ophelia_%28character%29.html" title="Ophelia (character)">Ophelia</a></b> is Polonius's daughter. She and Hamlet have had romantic feelings for each other, although they (at least implicitly) have been warned that it would be politically inexpedient for them to marry. Tormented by Hamlet as part of his 'madness', her father's death causes her to go insane, and she falls into a brook and drowns (either on purpose or accidentally, depending on the interpretation).</p>
<p><b><a href="/wiki/Horatio_%28character%29.html" title="Horatio (character)">Horatio</a></b> is a friend of Hamlet's from university. Apparently a commoner, or in any event not a close relative of the royal family, he is not directly involved in the intrigue at the Danish court, which enables the author to use him as a foil or sounding board for Hamlet. Hamlet commissions him to name Fortinbras King of Denmark after the deaths of the royal household.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Rosencrantz_and_Guildenstern.html" title="Rosencrantz and Guildenstern"><b>Rosencrantz</b> and <b>Guildenstern</b></a> are old school-fellows of Hamlet, who were summoned to the castle by Claudius to keep a watch on Hamlet. Hamlet soon suspects that they are spies. They die off-stage in England, executed by the King's warrant for Hamlet's death which was altered by Hamlet to name them instead.</p>
<p><b><a href="/wiki/Fortinbras.html" title="Fortinbras">Fortinbras</a></b> is the Norwegian crown prince. He is the son of King Fortinbras, who was killed in battle by Hamlet's father, and thus has vengeance on his mind. His firm and decisive action contrasts with Hamlet's procrastination.</p>
<p><b>Osric</b> is a courtier who referees the sword fight between Hamlet and Laertes, in which both are fatally wounded by a poisoned rapier.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Plot summary">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Plot_summary" id="Plot_summary"></a></p>
<h2>Plot summary</h2>
<p>The play concerns the revenge of Prince Hamlet, whose father, the late King of <a href="/wiki/Denmark.html" title="Denmark">Denmark</a>, victor over the Polish army, died suddenly while Hamlet was away from home at <a href="/wiki/Martin_Luther_University_of_Halle-Wittenberg.html" title="Martin Luther University of Halle-Wittenberg">Wittenberg University</a>, supposedly bitten by a poisonous snake. Prior to the opening of the play, the King's brother Claudius has been proclaimed king, and cemented his claim to the throne by marrying Hamlet's mother Gertrude, the widowed Queen.</p>
<p>The play opens on the battlements of <a href="/wiki/Elsinore.html" title="Elsinore">Elsinore</a> Castle, seat of the Danish monarchy, where a group of sentries are visited by the ghost of the recently deceased King Hamlet. Hamlet's friend Horatio joins the soldiers on their watch and when the ghost appears, bids it to speak. They suspect it has some message to deliver, but it vanishes without speaking.</p>
<p>The next day, the Danish court meets to celebrate the wedding of Claudius and Gertrude. The new King urges Hamlet not to persist in his grief. When he is alone, Hamlet expresses his anger at the accession of his uncle Claudius to the throne and his mother's hasty remarriage. Horatio and the guards come to the scene and tell him of the appearance of the ghost of his father. Hamlet is determined to investigate this.</p>
<p>Joining Horatio on the watch on the battlements that night, the ghost appears again. It beckons him to come along with him and then reveals a fearful secret: his father was murdered. He was poisoned through the ear by Claudius, and the Ghost commands Hamlet to avenge him. Shocked by this discovery, Hamlet returns to Horatio and the sentries, making them swear an oath not to reveal details of the night's events to anyone.</p>
<dl>
<dd>"But know, thou noble youth,</dd>
<dd>The serpent that did sting thy father's life</dd>
<dd>Now wears his crown."</dd>
<dd>[Act 1, Scene 5]</dd>
</dl>
<p>Hamlet is unsure whether the ghost he has seen is really his father, and suspects that it might be <a href="/wiki/The_Devil.html" title="The Devil">the Devil</a> taking his father's appearance in order to take his soul to <a href="/wiki/Hell.html" title="Hell">hell</a>. He therefore sets out to test the king's conscience through putting on an "antic disposition" (feigning madness), in the hope that his behaviour might reveal the truth, or otherwise provide an opportunity to kill Claudius.</p>
<p>Hamlet feigns insanity in order to convict Claudius of murder and treason, and takes particular delight in making a fool of Polonius, the king's chief councillor. Polonius, convinced of Hamlet's madness, is certain that it stems from his unrequited love for his daughter Ophelia, whom both he and Laertes forbade to continue her relationship with Hamlet. Polonius fears for his status at court and offers his services to the King in this matter in an attempt to redeem himself before the King of any guilt. He suggests arranging a meeting between Hamlet and Ophelia during which Polonius and Claudius will spy upon them both. Claudius, perhaps suspecting Hamlet's ruse, also asks Hamlet's schoolmates Rosencrantz and Guildenstern to monitor him, but Hamlet does not let his guard down and sees the intention behind his schoolmates' sudden visit. He enlists a company of travelling performers to stage an existing play, <i>The Murder of Gonzago</i>, which he has modified to re-enact the circumstances of his father's murder.</p>
<dl>
<dd>"The play's the thing</dd>
<dd>Wherein I'll catch the conscience of the King."</dd>
<dd>[Act II, scene II]</dd>
</dl>
<p>Shortly after the play begins, Claudius, who cannot bear to watch, rises calling for lights. The king's anguished reaction to the performance (which Horatio also notices) convinces Hamlet of his guilt. Shortly afterwards, Claudius arranges for Hamlet to be deported to the Danish territories of <a href="/wiki/England.html" title="England">England</a> along with Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, where he is to be killed upon arrival. Alone, Claudius privately expresses his disgust at what he has done, and offers a prayer of repentance. Hamlet discovers Claudius at prayer and prepares to kill him, but then stops, reasoning that he does not want his revenge to have the result of sending the repentant Claudius to <a href="/wiki/Heaven.html" title="Heaven">Heaven</a>. Ironically, after Hamlet slips away, Claudius concludes that he is unable to repent in his current state of mind; thus, if Hamlet had not attempted to arrogate to himself the destiny of Claudius's soul, rather than just his life, he would have achieved the ultimate justice he sought. By trying to go beyond the ghost's orders, he has doomed his efforts to failure.</p>
<p>Hamlet confronts his mother about the murder of his father and her sexual relations with her new husband. During their conversation, he stabs Polonius, who has been hiding behind a tapestry and eavesdropping on their conversation. Initially suspecting his victim was Claudius, he appears unrepentant and unconcerned when Polonius is revealed, continuing to admonish his mother. King Hamlet's ghost makes a reappearance to rebuke Hamlet. Hamlet's mother cannot see the ghost, but sees him conversing with it, convinced that her son has really gone mad.</p>
<p>Claudius, who has finally understood Hamlet's real motivation, sends Hamlet to England, supposedly for his safety, but accompanied by a sealed letter to the English ordering his death. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are sent along to ensure the orders are carried out. When later he returns to Denmark, Hamlet describes how his ship was attacked by pirates, who took him prisoner but then returned him to Denmark.</p>
<p>During Hamlet's absence, Ophelia, gravely disturbed by Hamlet's rejection and the death of Polonius, goes insane. She sings a number of rustic melodies that Shakespeare may have borrowed from the English folk tradition. Meanwhile, Laertes, her brother, leads a mob to Elsinore when he hears of his father's death. He also discovers his precious sister's madness, and is even more inclined to avenge his family. Claudius turns Laertes's anger on Hamlet, and they plan to have Laertes fence with Hamlet in a fixed fencing match. Laertes will be using an unbated and poisoned foil. In addition, Claudius prepares some poisoned wine for Hamlet to drink as a toast, in case Laertes is unable to hit him.</p>

<dd>"I will do't.</dd>
<dd>And, for that purpose, I'll anoint my sword.</dd>
<dd>I bought an unction of a mountebank,</dd>
<dd>So mortal that, but dip a knife in it,</dd>

<dd>[Act 4, Scene 4]</dd>
</dl>
<p>But as they are plotting, Queen Gertrude enters and informs Laertes that her sister drowned in what is a suspected suicide. Laertes runs out of the room, grief-stricken.</p>
<p>Returning from his voyage, Hamlet meets Horatio at a graveyard outside <a href="/wiki/Elsinore.html" title="Elsinore">Elsinore</a> castle just as Ophelia's funeral cortege arrives there, where a gravedigger (jester/clown) is digging. Hamlet finds the skull of <a href="/wiki/Yorick.html" title="Yorick">Yorick</a> (see <a href="/wiki/Skull_%28symbolism%29.html" title="Skull (symbolism)">skull as a symbol</a>), an old jester to the court who carried him on his back during his childhood days, and proclaims, "Here hung those lips that I have kissed I know not how oft." As Hamlet broods on mortality, the cortege arrives with the King, Queen and Laertes. Hamlet is so distraught to learn of Ophelia's death that he leaps into the open grave and grapples with Laertes.</p>
<p>When the match begins, Hamlet wins the first two rounds, and Gertrude drinks some of the wine to toast him, unaware that it is poisoned (although some critics and performances treat this as a deliberate suicide <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.hamlethaven.com/gertrude.html#shand">[1]</a>). Hamlet is hit with the sword and fatally poisoned, but in the ensuing brawl, he swaps blades with Laertes, and deals a deep wound to Laertes with the poisoned sword as well. The Queen dies from the wine, warning Hamlet that the drink is poisoned. With his dying breath, Laertes also confesses the whole plot to Hamlet. Enraged, Hamlet kills Claudius with the poisoned weapon, forcing him also to drink the poisoned wine, at last avenging his father's death.</p>
<p>Horatio, horrified at the turn of events, seizes the poisoned wine and proposes to join his friend in death, but Hamlet wrests the cup away from him. He orders him to tell his story to the world to restore his good name. Hamlet also recommends that the Norwegian prince, Fortinbras, be chosen as the successor to the Danish throne. Hamlet dies, and Horatio mourns his passing:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"Now cracks a noble heart: Good night sweet prince:</dd>
<dd>And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest!"</dd>
<dd>[Act V, scene II]</dd>
</dl>
<p>Fortinbras enters with English ambassadors. Shocked by the carnage, he orders a military funeral for Hamlet, whilst Horatio offers to relate the whole tale.</p>

<p>Like the play itself, Hamlet the character is possibly the most discussed and contentious character in <a href="/wiki/Drama.html" title="Drama">drama</a> and indeed in <a href="/wiki/Western_literature.html" title="Western literature">Western literature</a>. While conceding he is one of Shakespeare's greatest creations, critics are at odds over the inner motivations and <a href="/wiki/Psyche_%28psychology%29.html" title="Psyche (psychology)">psyche</a> of this character. His relationships with the various characters of the story, including his father, his uncle Claudius, his mother Gertrude and his beloved Ophelia, have all been subjected to multiple speculations, including modern <a href="/wiki/Psychology.html" title="Psychology">psychological theories</a>. Critics as varied as <a href="/wiki/Goethe.html" title="Goethe">Goethe</a>, <a href="/wiki/Samuel_Taylor_Coleridge.html" title="Samuel Taylor Coleridge">Coleridge</a>, <a href="/wiki/Hegel.html" title="Hegel">Hegel</a>, <a href="/wiki/August_Wilhelm_Schlegel.html" title="August Wilhelm Schlegel">Schlegel</a>, <a href="/wiki/Nietzsche.html" title="Nietzsche">Nietzsche</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ivan_Turgenev.html" title="Ivan Turgenev">Turgenev</a>, <a href="/wiki/Freud.html" title="Freud">Freud</a>, <a href="/wiki/T._S._Eliot.html" title="T. S. Eliot">T. S. Eliot</a>, <a href="/wiki/C.S._Lewis.html" title="C.S. Lewis">C.S. Lewis</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Isaac_Asimov.html" title="Isaac Asimov">Asimov</a> have written essays on him, each with an alternately fascinating insight. <a href="/wiki/J._Dover_Wilson.html" title="J. Dover Wilson">J. Dover Wilson</a> produced one of the most influential readings of the first half of the 20th century; <a href="/wiki/Harold_Bloom.html" title="Harold Bloom">Harold Bloom</a> was dominant in the second half. Besides being Shakespeare's most demanding role (with over 1,400 lines), Hamlet is also the most introspective. Actors have traditionally struggled with this role, and it can be safely said that any one performance can capture only some of the many facets of the creation. This, however, has made the role of Hamlet one of the most desired roles in theatre.</p>
<p>The plot summary above presents perhaps the simplest view of Hamlet, as a person seeking truth in order to be certain that he is justified in carrying out the revenge called for by a ghost that claims to be the spirit of his father. The most standard view is that Hamlet is highly indecisive, which is the view as proposed by <a href="/wiki/Coleridge.html" title="Coleridge">Coleridge</a> and a number of other critics. "Shakespeare wished to impress upon us the truth, that action is the chief end to existence". The 1948 movie with <a href="/wiki/Laurence_Olivier.html" title="Laurence Olivier">Laurence Olivier</a> in the title role is introduced by a voiceover: "This is a story of a man who could not make up his mind."</p>
<p>Others see Hamlet as a person charged with a duty that he both knows and feels is right, yet is unwilling to carry out. In this view, all of his efforts to satisfy himself of King Claudius' guilt or his failure to act when he can are evidence of this unwillingness, and Hamlet berates himself for his inability to carry out his task. After observing a play-actor performing a scene, he notes that the actor was moved to tears in the passion of the story and compares this passion for an ancient Greek character, <a href="/wiki/The_Trojan_Women.html" title="The Trojan Women">Hecuba</a>, in light of his own situation:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"O, what a rogue and peasant slave am I!</dd>
<dd>Is it not monstrous that this player here,</dd>
<dd>But in a fiction, in a dream of passion,</dd>
<dd>Could force his soul so to his own conceit</dd>
<dd>That from her working all his visage wan'd;</dd>
<dd>Tears in his eyes, distraction in's aspect,</dd>
<dd>A broken voice, and his whole function suiting</dd>
<dd>With forms to his conceit? And all for nothing!</dd>
<dd>For Hecuba?</dd>
<dd>What's Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba,</dd>
<dd>That he should weep for her?" [...]</dd>
</dl>
<p>And he acknowledges to himself the terrible deed he must avenge, yet responds only with words:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"Yet I,</dd>
<dd>A dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak,</dd>
<dd>Like John-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause,</dd>
<dd>And can say nothing; no, not for a king</dd>
<dd>Upon whose property and most dear life</dd>
<dd>A damn'd defeat was made. Am I a coward?</dd>
<dd>[...]</dd>
<dd>But I am pigeon-liver'd, and lack gall</dd>
<dd>[...]</dd>
<dd>Why, what an ass am I! This is most brave,</dd>
<dd>That I, the son of a dear father murder'd,</dd>
<dd>Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell,</dd>
<dd>Must, like a whore, unpack my heart with words"</dd>
<dd>[Act II, sc. ii]</dd>
</dl>
<p>Hamlet's verbose and painful analyses of his situation and actions encourage many others to see his struggle as something far more existential in nature, having less to do with the revenge drama than with the human condition.</p>
<dl>
<dd>"The time is out of joint: Oh cursed spite,</dd>
<dd>That ever I was born to set it right."</dd>
<dd>[Act I, sc. v]</dd>
</dl>
<p>Another view of Hamlet, advanced by <a href="/wiki/Isaac_Asimov.html" title="Isaac Asimov">Isaac Asimov</a> in his <i>Guide to Shakespeare</i>, holds that his actions are attributable not to indecision, but to multiple motivations: his desire to avenge the wrong done to his father, coupled with his own ambition to succeed to the throne. The tragic error committed by Hamlet, in Asimov's view, is his overreaching wish to see Claudius damned, and not merely dead, which prevents him from killing Claudius at the opportune moment.</p>
<p>It has also been suggested that Hamlet's hesitations may also be rooted in the religious beliefs of Shakespeare's time. The <a href="/wiki/Reformation.html" title="Reformation">Reformation</a> had generated debate about the existence of <a href="/wiki/Purgatory.html" title="Purgatory">purgatory</a> (where King Hamlet claims he currently resides). The concept of purgatory is a <a href="/wiki/Catholic.html" title="Catholic">Catholic</a> one, and was frowned on in <a href="/wiki/Protestantism.html" title="Protestantism">Protestant</a> England. A devout Protestant might therefore presume the Ghost to be a spirit from <a href="/wiki/Hell.html" title="Hell">Hell</a> that must be ignored. This has led to the speculation that the elder Hamlet represented Catholicism while the son represented Protestantism.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Ernest_Jones.html" title="Ernest Jones">Ernest Jones</a>, following the work of Freud, held that Hamlet suffered from the 'Oedipus complex'. He said in his 'The Oedipus-Complex as An Explanation of Hamlet's Mystery: A Study in Motive': “His moral fate is bound up with his uncle's for good or ill. The call of duty to slay his uncle cannot be obeyed because it links itself with the call of his nature to slay his mother's husband, whether this is the first or the second; the latter call is strongly "repressed," and therefore necessarily the former also.”</p>
