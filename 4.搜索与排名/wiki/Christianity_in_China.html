<p><i>For a fuller account see <a href="/wiki/Nestorianism_in_China.html" title="Nestorianism in China">Nestorianism in China</a></i></p>
<p>Traditional Christian thought suggested that <a href="/wiki/Thomas_%28Apostle%29.html" title="Thomas (Apostle)">St. Thomas</a>, known as "the Apostle of India" or possibly <a href="/wiki/St._Bartholomew.html" title="St. Bartholomew">St. Bartholomew</a> were the first to spread the Christian gospel in China. <a href="/wiki/Third_century.html" title="Third century">Third century</a> Christian writer Arnobius mentions in a text a people known as the "Seres" as being among the groups (he enumerates also the Persians and Medes) which had been evangelized at that time. While there is evidence that Christianity existed in Mesopotamia and Persia by the early <a href="/wiki/Fourth_century.html" title="Fourth century">fourth century</a>, there is no documentation that it had entered China.</p>

<p>The first <a href="/wiki/Jesuit.html" title="Jesuit">Jesuit</a> attempt to reach China was made in <a href="/wiki/1552.html" title="1552">1552</a> by <a href="/wiki/Francis_Xavier.html" title="Francis Xavier">Francis Xavier</a>, but he died the same year on the Chinese island of <a href="/wiki/Shangchuan.html" title="Shangchuan">Shangchuan</a>, without having reached the mainland. In <a href="/wiki/1582.html" title="1582">1582</a>, Jesuits once again initiated mission work in China, introducing Western science, mathematics, and astronomy.

The Pope ultimately ruled against tolerating the continuation of these practices among Chinese Catholic converts.

<h3>The Missionary Period (1960-1900)</h3>
<p><a href="/wiki/Robert_Morrison_%28Scottish%29.html" title="Robert Morrison (Scottish)">Robert Morrison</a>, regarded among some Protestants as being the first Christian missionary to China arrived in Macao on <a href="/wiki/September_4.html" title="September 4">4 September</a>, 1807. Morrison produced a Chinese translation of the <a href="/wiki/Bible.html" title="Bible">Bible</a>. He also compiled a Chinese dictionary for the use of westerners. The Bible translation took twelve years and the compilation of the dictionary, sixteen years.</p>
<p>During the <a href="/wiki/1840s.html" title="1840s">1840s</a>, Western <a href="/wiki/Missionary.html" title="Missionary">missionaries</a> spread Christianity rapidly through the coastal cities that were open to foreign trade; the <a href="/wiki/Taiping_Rebellion.html" title="Taiping Rebellion">Taiping Rebellion</a> was connected in its origins to the missionary activity.</p>
<p>The missionary <a href="/wiki/Hudson_Taylor.html" title="Hudson Taylor">Hudson Taylor</a> has been called one of the most significant figures in Chinese history in the 1800's - native or foreign. The <a href="/wiki/China_Inland_Mission.html" title="China Inland Mission">China Inland Mission</a> was the largest mission agency in China and it is estimated that Taylor was responsible for more people being converted to Christianity than at any other time since <a href="/wiki/Paul_the_Apostle.html" title="Paul the Apostle">Paul the Apostle</a> brought Christian teaching to Europe. It was <a href="/wiki/Dixon_Edward_Hoste.html" title="Dixon Edward Hoste">Dixon Edward Hoste</a>, the successor to Hudson Taylor, who originally expressed the self-governing principles of the <a href="/wiki/Three-Self_Patriotic_Movement.html" title="Three-Self Patriotic Movement">Three-Self Patriotic Movement</a>, at the time he was articulating the goal of the China Inland Mission to establish an indigenous Chinese church that was free from foreign control.</p>
<p>British and American denominations, such as the <a href="/wiki/Methodist_Church_in_Britain.html" title="Methodist Church in Britain">British Methodist Church</a>, continued to send missionaries until they were prevented from doing so following the establishment of the <a href="/wiki/People%27s_Republic_of_China.html" title="People's Republic of China">People's Republic of China</a>. Protestant missionaries played an extremely important role in introducing knowledge of China to the United States and the United States to China. The book <i><a  class="new" title="The Small Woman">The Small Woman</a></i> and film <i><a href="/wiki/Inn_of_the_Sixth_Happiness.html" title="Inn of the Sixth Happiness">Inn of the Sixth Happiness</a></i> tell the story of one such missionary, <a href="/wiki/Gladys_Aylward.html" title="Gladys Aylward">Gladys Aylward</a>.</p>
<p>It is recorded that the first martyrdom of a Protestant Christian Chinese occurred in 1871 in Poklo, <a href="/wiki/Guangdong.html" title="Guangdong">Guangdong</a>. <a href="/wiki/Che_Kam_Kong.html" title="Che Kam Kong">Che Kam Kong</a> (or Chea Kunkong) visited Hong Kong in 1865, and in 1866 became a Christian. He proseltyzed extensively over the next five years, allegedly bringing about the conversion of over a hundred people in Poklo. Town elders, concerned with this abandonment of tradition, warned Che to stop, yet he refused. He was kidnapped and tortured in 1871 in an attempt to force him to give up his beliefs. He is said to have declared, "You may kill my body but you cannot destroy my soul". He was taken outside the city gates and killed; his body was cut up and thrown into a nearby river.</p>
<p>One of the most well-known Protestant missionaries in China was The Rev. Young John Allen, a Methodist missionary from the United States. Allen helped to spread knowledge of the West and for the need for Chinese reforms through his various Chinese-language newspapers. His publications, including 'The Church News', ran from 1868-1907. His most famous paper was the monthly '<a href="/wiki/Wan_Guo_Gong_Bao.html" title="Wan Guo Gong Bao">Wan Guo Gong Bao</a>', or 'A Review of the Times,' which discussed international politics, economic theory, the possibilities for reform in China and the repercussions of the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895. Contributors to the 'Review' included Western missionaries, Chinese converts and Allen himself. Although much of his papers' subject matter was secular, the writings had a decidedly Protestant Christian slant as it was his goal to convert China to Christianity.</p>

<p>One of the major points of contention about the Chinese missions, and about the missionary movement in general, regards the development of independent native churches. Since the beginning, Chinese and foreign critics have accused the 19th-century Christian missionaries of keeping the native churches dependent on the mission boards in Britain and the U.S. for financial support and clerical leadership alike. In some cases, the criticism is warranted, but much can be attributed to <a href="/wiki/Jingoism.html" title="Jingoism">jingoism</a> and <a href="/wiki/Xenophobia.html" title="Xenophobia">xenophobia</a> on the part of succeeding Chinese governments, and in the West to ideological rejection of perceived <a href="/wiki/Victorian_era.html" title="Victorian era">Victorian era</a> priggishness and paternalism. The survival of the Christian movement through such upheavals as the Boxer Rebellion, the Japanese occupation, and the Cultural Revolution suggests that most of this criticism is unfounded. This topic is addressed repeatedly in the journal of Dr. Nathan Sites, a missionary who served in Fukien (<a href="/wiki/Fujian.html" title="Fujian">Fujian</a>) province from 1861 until his death in 1895. Dr. Sites, like many other missionaries, argued and labored for the creation of a strong and independent Chinese church. In this effort, he ordained many of the earliest native Christian ministers, most famously a former <a href="/wiki/Confucius.html" title="Confucius">Confucian</a> scholar by the name of Sia Sek Ong. After his ordination, Rev. Sia toured the United States, where he was feted with honorary degrees and an audience with President <a href="/wiki/Grover_Cleveland.html" title="Grover Cleveland">Grover Cleveland</a>.</p>

<h3>Popularity and Growth (1900-1925)</h3>
<p>The opening of the twentieth century ushered in what has been called Christianity’s Golden age in China. In reality it was a period of transition for both the church and the nation. China moved from Qing dynastic rule to a warlord-dominated republic to a united front of the Guomindang and Chinese Communist party in league against warlords and imperialism. Christianity enjoyed unprecedented popularity for two decades. Variety within the Protestant community increased; conservative, evangelical societies strengthened their presence; the social gospel approach gained momentum, and Chinese formed their own faith sects and autonomous churches.</p>
<p>Reaction to the failures of nineteenth century reform movements and to international humiliation subsequent to the <a href="/wiki/Boxer_Uprising.html" title="Boxer Uprising">Boxer Uprising</a> helped create a readiness for change in China. Many Chinese assumed that to modernize, China would have to import and adapt from the West. Since missionaries contended that Western progress derived from its Christian heritage, Christianity gained new favour. The missionaries, their writings and Christian schools were accessible sources of information; parochial schools filled to overflowing. Church membership expanded and Christian movements like the <a href="/wiki/YMCA.html" title="YMCA">YMCA</a> and YWCA became popular.</p>
<p>The number of <a href="/wiki/Protestant.html" title="Protestant">Protestant</a> missionaries had surpassed 8000 by <a href="/wiki/1925.html" title="1925">1925</a> and in the process, the nature of the community had altered. Estimates for the Chinee Protestant community ranged around 500,000.</p>
<p>There were also growing numbers of conservative evangelicals. Some came from traditional denomination, but others worked independently with minimal support, and many were sponsored by fundamentalist and faith groups like the <a href="/wiki/Seventh_Day_Adventist.html" title="Seventh Day Adventist">Seventh Day Adventists</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Christian_Missionary_Alliance.html" title="Christian Missionary Alliance">Christian Missionary Alliance</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/Assemblies_of_God.html" title="Assemblies of God">Assemblies of God</a>. <a href="/wiki/Pentecostal.html" title="Pentecostal">Pentecostal</a>, charismatic and Millenarian preachers brought a new zeal to the drive to evangelize the world.</p>
<p>Parochial schools also nurtured a corps of Christian leaders who acquired influential positions in education, diplomatic service and other government bureaus, medicine, business, the Christian church and Christian movements. In the Chrstian community, individuals like Yu Rizhang (David Yui 1882 - 1936), Zhao Zichen (趙紫宸, 1888-1989), Xu Baoqian (徐寶謙, 1892-1944), and Liu Tingfang (<a  class="new" title="Timothy Liu">Timothy Liu</a>/劉廷芳, 1890-1947) stand out. Most were characterized with liberal theology, commitment to social reform, deep Chinese patriotism, and acquaintance with Western learning. Many of these leaders held popular revival meetings in Christian schools throughout China and, along with conservative churchmen like Cheng Jingyi (1881-1939), sparked the drive for greater Chinese autonomy and leadership in the church.</p>
<p>They became Chinese spokesmen in the National Christian Council, a liaison committee for Protestant churches, and the Church of Christ in China (CCC), established in 1927 to work toward independence. Even so, progress toward autonomy proved to be slow, for Western mission boards were reluctant to relinquish the power of the pocket book, which gave them a decisive voice in most matters of importance.</p>
<p>Adding to the diversity and also to the conservative trend was the proliferation of completely autonomous Chinese Christian churches and communities, a new phenomenon in Chinese Protestantism. Noteworthy was the <a  class="new" title="China Christian Independent Church">China Christian Independent Church</a> (Zhōngguó Yēsūjiào Zìlìhuì), a federation which by 1920 had over 100 member churches, drawn mostly from the Chinese urban class. In contrast was the <a href="/wiki/True_Jesus_Church.html" title="True Jesus Church">True Jesus Church</a> (Zhēn Yēsū Jiàohuì), founded in 1917; Pentecostal, millenarian and exclusivist, it was concentrated in the central interior provinces.</p>
<p>Sometimes independence derived not so much from a desire to indigenize Christianity as from the nature of leadership. <a href="/wiki/Wang_Mingdao.html" title="Wang Mingdao">Wang Mingdao</a> (1900-1991) and Song Shangjie (<a href="/wiki/John_Sung.html" title="John Sung">John Sung</a>, 1900-1944) were zealous, confident of possessing the truth, and critical of what they peceived as lukewarm formalism in the Protestant establishments. They drew on the revivalism and mysticism of Western “faith sects” and the Pentecostalism of the True Jesus Church. During the 1920s and 1930s both Wang and Song worked as independent itinerant preachers, holding highly successful and emotional meetings in established churches and other venues. Their message was simple: “today’s evil world demands repentance; otherwise hell is our destiny”. To this doomsday prophecy, Song added faith healing. Their premillenial eschatology attracted tens of thousands of followers set adrift in an environment of political chaos, civil war, and personal hardship.</p>

<h3>Era of National and social change, the Japanese Occupation Period (1925-1949)</h3>
<p>In the aftermath of World War I, many westerners experienced a crisis of confidence. How could western nations, which had just emerged from one of the most destructive war of modern times, justify preaching morality to others? Volunteers, financial and intellectual support began a steady decline. The 1929 depression soon compunded the economic troubles. Yet the difficulties accelerated indigenization.</p>
<p>Since many Chinese Christian leaders were interntionalists and pacifists, the Japanese invasion of Manchuria in 1931 presented a dilemma. Most abandoned their pacifism, and many joined the National Salvation Movement. After the December 1941 Pearl Harbour incident, Japan shortly invaded much of China and the Pacific region, with the evacuation or internment of most Westerners. As a result of being separated due to <a href="/wiki/World_War_II.html" title="World War II">World War II</a>, Christian churches and organizations had their first experience with autonomy from the Western-guided structures of the missionary church organizations. Once again Chinese were left to carry on and once again the Chinese Protestant church moved toward independence, union, or Chinese control. Some scholars suggest this helped lay the foundation for the independent denominations and churches of the post-war period and the eventual development of the Three-Self Church and the CCPA. After the end of the war, the <a href="/wiki/Chinese_Civil_War.html" title="Chinese Civil War">Chinese Civil War</a> began in earnest, which had an effect on the rebuilding and development of the churches after the close of Japanese occupation.</p>
<p>The chaos that was China during the 1930s and 1940s spawned religious movements that emphasized direct spiritual experience and an eschatology offering hope and comfort beyong this cruel world. In opposition to the "Y" and the Student Christian Movement, conservatives organized the Intervarsity Christian fellowship in 1945; for them, <a  class="new" title="Social Gospel theology">Social Gospel theology</a> was not simply impotent; it had lost site of the centrality of a personal relationship with the divine. The Jesus Family (Yēsū Jiātíng), founded about 1927, expanded in rural north and central China. Communitarian, pentecostal, and millenarian, its family communities lived, worked and held prperty jointly; wordhhip often included <a href="/wiki/Speaking_in_tongues.html" title="Speaking in tongues">speaking in tongues</a> and revealtions from the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>The salvationist promise of <a href="/wiki/Wang_Mingdao.html" title="Wang Mingdao">Wang Mingdao</a>, <a href="/wiki/John_Sung.html" title="John Sung">John Sung</a>, and <a  class="new" title="Ji Zhiwen">Ji Zhiwen</a> (Andrew Gih/計志文, 1901-1985) continued to attract throngs of followers, many of them already Christians. Ni Tuosheng (<a href="/wiki/Watchman_Nee.html" title="Watchman Nee">Watchman Nee</a>, 1903-1972), founder of the <a href="/wiki/Local_churches.html" title="Local churches">Church Assembly Hall</a> (nicknamed as "Litle Flock"), drew adherents with its assurances of a glorious New Jeruslaem in the next life for those who experienced rebirth and adhered to a strict morality. By 1945, Ni's hierarchically controlled and sectarian movement claimed a membership of over 70,000, organized into some 700 assemblies. yhe independent churches altogether accounted for well over 200,000 protestants.</p>
<p>The Chinese Protestant church entered the communist era having made significant progress toward self-support and self-government. Though Chinese rulers had traditionally sought to regulate organized religion and the CCP would continue the practise, Chinese christians had gained experience in the art of accommodation in order to protect its members. Independent churches and a variety of evangelical sects broadened the appeal of Protestantism, especially in rural China. More than was realized at the time, Christianity in all its variety had taken root in China and possessed the strength and techniques to urvive decades of hostility and persecution.</p>

<h2>Christianity in the contemporary PRC</h2>
<p>Today, the Chinese language typically divides <a href="/wiki/Christians.html" title="Christians">Christians</a> into two groups, members of <i>Jidu jiao</i>, (literally, Christianity) Protestantism, and members of <i>Tianzhu jiao</i> (literally "Lord of Heaven" religion), Catholicism (<i>see <a href="/wiki/Protestantism_in_China.html" title="Protestantism in China">Protestantism in China</a> and <a href="/wiki/Catholicism_in_China.html" title="Catholicism in China">Catholicism in China</a></i>.)</p>
<p>Some informal groups have emerged in the 1970s that seem to have been wholly new in origin, or perhaps to have sprouted from earlier seeds but grown into distinctly new movements. One of the best documented of these groups was founded by <a  class="new" title="Peter Xu Zongze">Peter Xu Zongze</a>, an independent evangelist who began preaching in <a href="/wiki/Henan.html" title="Henan">Henan</a> in 1968. his organization, variously called the <a  class="new" title="New Birth Sect">New Birth Sect</a> (重生派), the <a  class="new" title="Full Scope Church">Full Scope Church</a> (全范围教会), or the Criers, is accused by some as being heretical. It is distinguished by a strong emphasis on a definitive experience of conversion, usually during an intensive three-day "life meeting", and by an emphasis (some say a requirement) on a confession of sins with tears. Xu has claimed that his organization consists of over 3500 congregations and has sent evangelists to more than twenty of China's provinces. These numbers cannot be independently verified, but it is evident that there are several other organized networks claiming a similarly large number of adherents, and many other groups of smaller scope.</p>

<p>Many Christians choose however to meet independently of these organisations, typically in <a href="/wiki/Chinese_house_church.html" title="Chinese house church">house churches</a>. These fellowships are not officially registered and are seen as illegal entities and are often persecuted heavily.

At the same time, there has been increasing tolerance of house churches since the late 1970s.</p>

<h3>Most Famous Chinese Missionary</h3>
<p>Minnie Vautrin a missionary and founder of the Christian girls school, the Ginling College in Nanjing has been memorialized in a novel called NANKING. The novel is a fictionalized account of what happened to her during that fateful month of December, 1937, when she personally saved the lives of over 10,000 innocent women and children. A recent review of this novel is available. Review written by the New York Times best-selling author, Ellen Tanner Marsh, the book, NANKING is written by author, Kevin A. Kent.</p>
<p>"All too often in the literary world, the horrors of war are made even more grotesque by bad writing about war, from poorly plotted action-adventure tales to cloying melodramas. In contrast, author Kevin A. Kent’s WWII epic, Nanking, is a highly-informed, crisply written novel that, though set in a period of intense conflict, does not rely upon the setting alone to drive the tautly-paced narrative. Nanking is the story of the eponymous city in China that was the target of invading Japanese forces in the late 1930s. More than a historic account of a siege, it is the wrenching drama of the everyday heroes—mostly foreign—who stayed through the city’s occupation in order to help save its beleaguered residents. Kent’s heroine is diminutive Minnie Vautrin, an idealistic American missionary who chooses to remain in the doomed city to safeguard the students of the all-girls school she administers. Yet this is no overblown melodrama; Minnie’s journey is tragic, and Kent knows better than to romanticize even the most inconsequential detail. Yes, the reality is stark, but the tone is never maudlin, while Kent’s carefully executed series of flashbacks, along with deliberate and tautly stylized pacing, allow readers to empathize with the characters and the situation—one that, thankfully, falls outside the bounds of common experience. Nanking is vivid and cinematic, a tale that is evocative of a place and time that, played out on so many ferocious fronts, forever changed the world. Readers will no doubt look forward to future works by this author—although writing a novel as compelling as Nanking would be a feat, indeed.

<h2>Some Chinese terms in Christianity</h2>
<dl>
<dd><i>For full coverage see <a href="/wiki/Chinese_terms_for_God.html" title="Chinese terms for God">Chinese terms for God</a></i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Names of God in Chinese:</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Shangdi.html" title="Shangdi">Shangdi</a> (上帝, literally, "Sovereign King Above") is one of the most prevalent terms for God in modern <a href="/wiki/Chinese_language.html" title="Chinese language">Chinese</a>, used by non-Christians in conversations as well as Christians. The Catholic Church historically favored Tianzhu (天主, literally, Lord of Heaven) over <a href="/wiki/Shangdi.html" title="Shangdi">Shangdi</a>, more commonly by Protestant Christians. 基利斯督 was an old term for Christ pronounced "gaylayseedok" in Cantonese, which tries to capture the Greek (Χριστός, Christos) or Latin (Christus) pronunciation. The shortened form 基督 (Pinyin is "Jidu") is used more commonly in both Catholic and Protestant circles. In most modern Protestant Chinese Bibles, the word 神 (<i>Shen</i>, a reference to a godly supreme being or a spirit or spirit generally) is used widely as well as <a href="/wiki/Shangdi.html" title="Shangdi">Shangdi</a>. The space used before the character "神" is intentional, in order to demonstrate reverence. The Protestant version of the Chinese Bibles use 靈(<i>Ling</i>, which means "spirit") to refer to the Spirit. The Catholic version, in contrast, uses 神 ("sheng", or spirit). When it is referring to the Holy Spirit, a word 聖(<i>sheng</i>, holy) is used before the word spirit to refer to the Holy Spirit. An evil spirit will have a modifier "evil" before the spirit. In addition, the Hebrew word "YHWH" is translated into 雅威 "yǎwēi" by Catholics (This translation is used only in the Catholic Church. It is only to capture the most sacred Hebrew pronunciation of the name of God, but 雅 means refined or graceful while 威 means might.) and "Jehovah" into 耶和華 (yēhéhuá) by Chinese Protestants (Similarly, the term is used only in Chinese-speaking Protestant circle). Originally, 爺火華 (<i>yéhuǒhuá</i>) was used, which had a much more violent connotation than the modern translation. Some versions translate this term as 上主 (shang zhu, Above Lord), similar to the translation decision made as capitalized "LORD", used by both Catholics and traditional Protestants like Anglicans and Lutherans, specially in the prayers in the Eucharist. However, the term 主 (zhu, Lord) is used by both Catholics and traditional Protestants in list formal prayers, and always by contemporary Protestants.</p>
<p>Chinese-language terms for <i>God</i> have, since the introduction of <a href="/wiki/Christianity.html" title="Christianity">Christianity</a> to <a href="/wiki/China.html" title="China">China</a>, proved a point of contention for <strong class="selflink">Chinese Christians</strong> and non-Chinese Christians in China, especially <a href="/wiki/Missionaries.html" title="Missionaries">missionaries</a>.</p>
<p>Chinese for Three Main Types of Christians:</p>
<p>The modern Chinese language typically divides Christians into two groups, believers of <a href="/wiki/Protestantism.html" title="Protestantism">Protestantism</a> <i>Jidu jiaotu</i> (基督教徒, a term that sometimes refers to Chritianity), and believers of <a href="/wiki/Catholicism.html" title="Catholicism">Catholicism</a><i>Tianzhu jiaotu</i> (天主教徒). <a href="/wiki/Orthodox.html" title="Orthodox">Orthodox</a> are referred to as 東正教徒"dongzheng jiaotu", but more correctly 正教徒"zhengjiaotu," because there is only one Chinese term for both Eastern and Oriental which is 東 "dong" and simply means the east. The latter term is more correct also because <a href="/wiki/Eastern_Orthodox.html" title="Eastern Orthodox">Eastern Orthodox</a> churches are not in communion with and thus differ from the <a href="/wiki/Oriental_Orthodox.html" title="Oriental Orthodox">Oriental Orthodox</a> churches.</p>
<p>Chinese for Christianity:</p>
<p>基督教 has traditionally referred to Christianity; however, to reduce confusion and for ecumenical movement, 基督新教 is used to denote Protestant churches, while 基督宗教 represents the religion of Christianity.</p>
