<h2>Alleged ties to terrorism</h2>
<p>Born in <a href="/wiki/Saudi_Arabia.html" title="Saudi Arabia">Saudi Arabia</a>, Abu Zubaydah has been close to al-Qaida all his life, helping to operate a popular terrorist training camp near the border between <a href="/wiki/Afghanistan.html" title="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a> and <a href="/wiki/Pakistan.html" title="Pakistan">Pakistan</a> in the early 1990s. He became an associate of <a href="/wiki/Ibn_al-Shaykh_al-Libi.html" title="Ibn al-Shaykh al-Libi">Ibn al-Shaykh al-Libi</a>, and served as a chief recruiter for al-Qaida.</p>
<p>In the late 1990s, Abu Zubaydah played a lead role in one of the <a href="/wiki/2000_millennium_attack_plots.html" title="2000 millennium attack plots">2000 millennium attack plots</a>, and a possible tangential role in a second. There were plans to bomb a fully booked <a href="/wiki/Radisson.html" title="Radisson">Radisson</a> hotel in <a href="/wiki/Amman.html" title="Amman">Amman</a>, <a href="/wiki/Jordan.html" title="Jordan">Jordan</a>, and three other sites. This targeted tourists from the <a href="/wiki/United_States.html" title="United States">United States</a> and <a href="/wiki/Israel.html" title="Israel">Israel</a>. But on <a href="/wiki/November_30.html" title="November 30">November 30</a>, <a href="/wiki/1999.html" title="1999">1999</a>, Jordanian intelligence intercepted a call between Abu Zubaydah and <a  class="new" title="Khadr Abu Hoshar">Khadr Abu Hoshar</a>, a <a href="/wiki/Palestinian.html" title="Palestinian">Palestinian</a> militant, and determined that an attack was imminent. Jordanian police arrested 22 conspirators and foiled the attack. Abu Zubaydah was sentenced to death <a href="/wiki/In_absentia.html" title="In absentia">in absentia</a> by a Jordanian court for his role. There is also evidence that Abu Zubaydah approved the Los Angeles airport bomb plot in 2000. This plot was also foiled.</p>
<p>In March of <a href="/wiki/2001.html" title="2001">2001</a>, <a href="/wiki/Condoleezza_Rice.html" title="Condoleezza Rice">Condoleezza Rice</a> was informed by the <a href="/wiki/Central_Intelligence_Agency.html" title="Central Intelligence Agency">CIA</a> that Zubaydah was planning a major operation in the near future. This was one of the first of many reports in the Spring of 2001 that increased the threat level and indicated that an attack was coming. Many of these reports mentioned Zubaydah by name. The attack finally came in the form of the <a href="/wiki/September_11%2C_2001_attacks.html" title="September 11, 2001 attacks">September 11, 2001 attacks</a>.</p>
<p>The U.S. government believes he became al-Qaeda's top military strategist following the death of <a href="/wiki/Muhammad_Atef.html" title="Muhammad Atef">Muhammad Atef</a> in November 2001. A later plot to <a href="/wiki/Paris_embassy_terrorist_attack_plot.html" title="Paris embassy terrorist attack plot">bomb the U.S. embassy in Paris</a> failed.</p>
<p>American intelligence officials alleged, in October 2001, that six Arab men, living in <a href="/wiki/Bosnia_and_Herzegovina.html" title="Bosnia and Herzegovina">Bosnia</a>, had been plotting to bomb the U.S. Embassy in <a href="/wiki/Sarajevo.html" title="Sarajevo">Sarajevo</a>, because they believed one of these men had made calls to a phone number in Afghanistan that had once been used by Zubaydah. These six men, dubbed the <a href="/wiki/Algerian_Six.html" title="Algerian Six">Algerian Six</a>, were kidnapped following their acquittal by the Bosnian Supreme Court, and ended up in Guantanamo. American intelligence officials quietly dropped the allegation that there had been a plot to bomb the embassy from the factors favoring their continued detention.</p>

<p>U.S. intelligence located Abu Zubaydah in 2002 by tracing his phone calls. He was captured <a href="/wiki/March_28.html" title="March 28">March 28</a>, <a href="/wiki/2002.html" title="2002">2002</a>, in a two story apartment in <a href="/wiki/Faisalabad.html" title="Faisalabad">Faisalabad</a>, Pakistan. He was shot three times in a firefight, including a wound to the groin and a wound to the thigh, but survived. While in U.S. custody, he has given a great deal of information about the 9/11 attack plot, although the veracity of some of his statement has been called into question.<sup id="_ref-newsweek_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[1]</a></sup> Such information was used by the Canadian government in seeking to uphold the 'security certificate' of <a href="/wiki/Mohamed_Harkat.html" title="Mohamed Harkat">Mohamed Harkat</a>. Critics have claimed that several of his interrogation sessions may have bordered on torture, the intent being to pressure Abu Zubaydah into fingering other suspects.</p>
<p>Abu Zubayda is held within the <a href="/wiki/CIA_prison_system.html" title="CIA prison system">CIA prison system</a>. His statements under interrogation have provided a very large amount of the information used around the world as 'definitive', although he is the sole person to make many of the claims.</p>

<h2>Capture</h2>
<p>Abu Zubaydah was captured in a <a href="/wiki/Safehouse.html" title="Safehouse">safehouse</a> in Pakistan. Several of the detainees who face charges before <a href="/wiki/Guantanamo_military_commission.html" title="Guantanamo military commission">military commissions</a> were captured at the same time as Abu Zubaydah.

<p>According to a <a href="/wiki/BBC_news.html" title="BBC news">BBC news</a> profile of Zubaydah, before his capture "few photographs of him were in existence, [and] he had used at least 37 aliases and was considered a master of disguise."<sup id="_ref-bbc_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[3]</a></sup></p>

<h2>Guantanamo Bay</h2>
<p>On September 6, 2006, President Bush announced at a <a href="/wiki/White_House.html" title="White House">White House</a> speech that "<a href="/wiki/Khalid_Sheikh_Mohammed.html" title="Khalid Sheikh Mohammed">Khalid Sheikh Mohammed</a>, <strong class="selflink">Abu Zubaydah</strong>, <a href="/wiki/Ramzi_bin_al-Shibh.html" title="Ramzi bin al-Shibh">Ramzi bin al-Shibh</a>, and 11 other terrorists in <a href="/wiki/Black_site.html" title="Black site">CIA custody</a> have been transferred to the <a href="/wiki/Guantanamo_Bay_Naval_Base.html" title="Guantanamo Bay Naval Base">United States Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay</a>." Bush stated the Zubaydah and others would face trial in a <a href="/wiki/Guantanamo_military_commission.html" title="Guantanamo military commission">military tribunal</a> if Congress passed legislation approving such procedures.<sup id="_ref-bushspeech_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>In the speech, Bush also disclosed details of Zubaydah's detention:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Within months of September the 11th, 2001, we captured a man known as Abu Zubaydah. We believe that Zubaydah was a senior terrorist leader and a trusted associate of Osama bin Laden. Our intelligence community believes he had run a terrorist camp in Afghanistan where some of the 9/11 hijackers trained, and that he helped smuggle al Qaeda leaders out of Afghanistan after coalition forces arrived to liberate that country. Zubaydah was severely wounded during the firefight that brought him into custody -- and he survived only because of the medical care arranged by the CIA.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>After he recovered, Zubaydah was defiant and evasive. He declared his hatred of America. During questioning, he at first disclosed what he thought was nominal information -- and then stopped all cooperation. Well, in fact, the "nominal" information he gave us turned out to be quite important. For example, Zubaydah disclosed Khalid Sheikh Mohammed -- or KSM -- was the mastermind behind the 9/11 attacks, and used the alias "Muktar." This was a vital piece of the puzzle that helped our intelligence community pursue KSM. Abu Zubaydah also provided information that helped stop a terrorist attack being planned for inside the United States -- an attack about which we had no previous information. Zubaydah told us that al Qaeda operatives were planning to launch an attack in the U.S., and provided physical descriptions of the operatives and information on their general location. Based on the information he provided, the operatives were detained -- one while traveling to the United States.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>We knew that Zubaydah had more information that could save innocent lives, but he stopped talking. As his questioning proceeded, it became clear that he had received training on how to resist interrogation. And so the CIA used an alternative set of procedures. These procedures were designed to be safe, to comply with our laws, our Constitution, and our treaty obligations. The Department of Justice reviewed the authorized methods extensively and determined them to be lawful. I cannot describe the specific methods used -- I think you understand why -- if I did, it would help the terrorists learn how to resist questioning, and to keep information from us that we need to prevent new attacks on our country. But I can say the procedures were tough, and they were safe, and lawful, and necessary.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>Zubaydah was questioned using these procedures, and soon he began to provide information on key al Qaeda operatives, including information that helped us find and capture more of those responsible for the attacks on September the 11th. For example, Zubaydah identified one of KSM's accomplices in the 9/11 attacks -- a terrorist named Ramzi bin al Shibh. The information Zubaydah provided helped lead to the capture of bin al Shibh. And together these two terrorists provided information that helped in the planning and execution of the operation that captured Khalid Sheikh Mohammed.</i><sup id="_ref-bushspeech_1" class="reference"><a  title="">[4]</a></sup></dd>
</dl>
<p>While Bush claimed that Zubaydah gave information that lead to al Shibh's capture, Spencer Ackerman notes that "the idea that Abu Zubaydah's interrogation tipped off the U.S. to the existence of Ramzi bin Al Shibh is just an outright lie. A Nexis search for "Ramzi Binalshibh" between September 11, 2001 and March 1, 2002--the U.S. captured Abu Zubaydah in March 2002--turns up 26 hits for The Washington Post alone. Everyone involved in counterterrorism knew who bin Al Shibh was. Now-retired FBI Al Qaeda hunter Dennis Lormel told Congress who Ramzi bin Al Shibh was in February 2002. Abu Zubaydah getting waterboarded and spouting bin Al Shibh's name did not tell us anything we did not already know."<a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.tnr.com/blog/theplank?pid=36597">[1]</a></p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: The One Percent Doctrine">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="The_One_Percent_Doctrine" id="The_One_Percent_Doctrine"></a></p>
<h2>The One Percent Doctrine</h2>
<p>In June 2006, <a href="/wiki/Simon_%26_Schuster.html" title="Simon &amp; Schuster">Simon &amp; Schuster</a> published a book titled <i><a href="/wiki/The_One_Percent_Doctrine.html" title="The One Percent Doctrine">The One Percent Doctrine</a></i> authored by <a href="/wiki/Ron_Suskind.html" title="Ron Suskind">Ron Suskind</a>. In the book, Suskind writes that sources in the intelligence community revealed to him that Abu Zubaydah knew nothing about the operations of al-Qaeda, but rather was al-Qaeda's go-to guy for minor logistics such as travel for wives and children. Suskind notes that Zubaydah turned out to be mentally ill, keeping a diary "in the voice of three people: Hani 1, Hani 2, and Hani 3" -- a boy, a young man and a middle-aged alter ego. The book also quotes Dan Coleman, then the FBI's top al-Qaeda analyst, telling a senior bureau official, "This guy is insane, certifiable, split personality." According to Suskind, this judgment was "echoed at the top of CIA and was, of course, briefed to the President and Vice President," yet two weeks later Bush gave a speech an labeled Zubaydah as "one of the top operatives plotting and planning death and destruction on the United States." Suskind also writes about how the CIA used torture to get Zubaydah to talk.<sup id="_ref-post_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[5]</a></sup> One counterterrorism official criticized the book, telling the <a href="/wiki/Washington_Times.html" title="Washington Times">Washington Times</a> "A lot of information is simply wrong." The anonymous official told the <i>Times</i> that Zubaydah was "crazy like a fox" and was a senior planner inside al Qaeda who has provided critical information on how Osama bin Laden's group works.<sup id="_ref-times_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[6]</a></sup> John McLaughlin, former acting CIA director, has also stated, "I totally disagree with the view that the capture of Abu Zubaydah was unimportant. Abu Zubaydah was woven through all of the intelligence prior to 9/11 that signaled a major attack was coming, and his capture yielded a great deal of important information."<sup id="_ref-situationroom_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[7]</a></sup> In an interview with the Washington Times, Suskind stood by his book, saying "[Bush] clearly oversold the importance of the first major capture. That is undeniable." He maintained that Zubaydah was in fact crazy, stating that "The real debate now is how democracy is really challenged in terms of transparency and accountability when it is fighting a war that will largely be conducted going forward in secrecy." When asked specifically by <a href="/wiki/Wolf_Blitzer.html" title="Wolf Blitzer">Wolf Blitzer</a> about the useful information Zubaydah allegedly provided, Suskind replied, "I show in the book exactly the useful information he provided, and at the same time I show that essentially what happened is we tortured an insane man and jumped screaming at every word he uttered, most of them which were nonsense."<sup id="_ref-situationroom_1" class="reference"><a  title="">[7]</a></sup> In outlining Suskind's book, Sidney Blumenthal summarized: "But the decision was made to 'torture a mentally disturbed man and then leap, screaming, at every word he uttered.' He was 'waterboarded,' simulating drowning. Zubaydah babbled about terrorist threats to shopping malls, nuclear power plants, supermarkets, and about al-Qaida plans to build a nuclear device. The administration sounded alerts on every unconfirmed threat. In May 2002, New York City was put on high alert over Zubaydah's torture-incited ravings that the Brooklyn Bridge and the Statue of Liberty were targets. Cheney went on 'Larry King Live' to defend the alerts: 'We now have a large number of people in custody, detainees, and periodically as we go through this process we learn more about the possibility of future attacks.'"<a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.salon.com/opinion/blumenthal/2006/06/22/iraq_debate/index.html">[2]</a></p>
