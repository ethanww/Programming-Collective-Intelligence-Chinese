<h3>Title</h3>
<p>Originally Orwell titled the book <i>The Last Man in Europe</i>, but his publisher, Frederic Warburg, suggested a change to assist in the book's marketing. <sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a  title="">[2]</a></sup> Orwell did not object to this suggestion. The reasons for the current title of the novel is not absolutely known. In fact, Orwell may have only switched the last two digits of the year in which he wrote the book (1948). Alternatively, he may have been making an allusion to the centenary of the <a href="/wiki/Fabian_Society.html" title="Fabian Society">Fabian Society</a>, a socialist organization founded in <a href="/wiki/1884.html" title="1884">1884</a>. The allusion may have also been directed to <a href="/wiki/Jack_London.html" title="Jack London">Jack London</a>'s novel <i><a href="/wiki/The_Iron_Heel.html" title="The Iron Heel">The Iron Heel</a></i> (in which the power of a political movement reaches its height in 1984), to <a href="/wiki/G._K._Chesterton.html" title="G. K. Chesterton">G. K. Chesterton</a>'s <i><a href="/wiki/The_Napoleon_of_Notting_Hill.html" title="The Napoleon of Notting Hill">The Napoleon of Notting Hill</a></i> (also set in that year), or to a poem that his wife, <a href="/wiki/Eileen_O%27Shaughnessy.html" title="Eileen O'Shaughnessy">Eileen O'Shaughnessy</a>, had written, called <i>End of the Century, 1984</i>.</p>

<h3>Orwell's inspiration</h3>
<p>In his essay <i>Why I Write</i>, Orwell clearly explains that all the "serious work" he had written since the <a href="/wiki/Spanish_Civil_War.html" title="Spanish Civil War">Spanish Civil War</a> in 1936 was "written, directly or indirectly, against <a href="/wiki/Totalitarianism.html" title="Totalitarianism">totalitarianism</a> and for democratic socialism". (<i><a  class="external text" title="http://www.resort.com/~prime8/Orwell/whywrite.html">Why I Write</a></i>) Therefore, one can look at <i>Nineteen Eighty-Four</i> as a <a href="/wiki/Cautionary_tale.html" title="Cautionary tale">cautionary tale</a> against totalitarianism and in particular the betrayal of a revolution by those claiming to defend or support it. However, as many reviewers and critics have stated, it should not be read as an attack on <a href="/wiki/Socialism.html" title="Socialism">socialism</a> as a whole, but on totalitarianism (and potential totalitarianism).</p>
<p>Orwell had already set forth his distrust of totalitarianism and the betrayal of revolutions in <i><a href="/wiki/Homage_to_Catalonia.html" title="Homage to Catalonia">Homage to Catalonia</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Animal_Farm.html" title="Animal Farm">Animal Farm</a></i>. <i><a href="/wiki/Coming_Up_For_Air.html" title="Coming Up For Air">Coming Up For Air</a></i>, at points, celebrates the individual freedom that is lost in <i>Nineteen Eighty-Four</i>.</p>

</div>
<p>Orwell based many aspects of Oceanian society on the <a href="/wiki/Joseph_Stalin.html" title="Joseph Stalin">Stalin</a>-era <a href="/wiki/Soviet_Union.html" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a>. The "Two Minutes' Hate", for instance was based on Stalinism's habitual demonisation of its enemies and rivals, and the description of <a href="/wiki/Big_Brother_%281984%29.html" title="Big Brother (1984)">Big Brother</a> himself bears a physical resemblance to Stalin. The Party's proclaimed great enemy, <a href="/wiki/Emmanuel_Goldstein.html" title="Emmanuel Goldstein">Emmanuel Goldstein</a>, resembles <a href="/wiki/Leon_Trotsky.html" title="Leon Trotsky">Leon Trotsky</a>, particularly in that both are <a href="/wiki/Jew.html" title="Jew">Jewish</a>.</p>
<p>Orwell's biographer Michael Shelden recognizes, as influences on the work: the <a href="/wiki/Edwardian_period.html" title="Edwardian period">Edwardian</a> world of his childhood in <a href="/wiki/Henley.html" title="Henley">Henley</a> for the "golden country"; his being bullied at <a href="/wiki/St_Cyprian%27s_School.html" title="St Cyprian's School">St. Cyprian's</a> for feelings of victims toward tormentors; his life in the Indian Burma Police and his experiences with <a href="/wiki/Censorship.html" title="Censorship">censorship</a> in the <a href="/wiki/BBC.html" title="BBC">BBC</a> for models of authoritarian power. Specific literary influences Shelden mentions include <a href="/wiki/Arthur_Koestler.html" title="Arthur Koestler">Arthur Koestler</a>'s books <i><a href="/wiki/Darkness_at_Noon.html" title="Darkness at Noon">Darkness at Noon</a></i> and <i>The Yogi and the Commissar;</i> <a href="/wiki/Jack_London.html" title="Jack London">Jack London</a>'s <i><a href="/wiki/The_Iron_Heel.html" title="The Iron Heel">The Iron Heel</a></i> (1908); <a href="/wiki/Aldous_Huxley.html" title="Aldous Huxley">Aldous Huxley</a>'s <i><a href="/wiki/Brave_New_World.html" title="Brave New World">Brave New World</a></i> (1930); <a href="/wiki/Yevgeny_Zamyatin.html" title="Yevgeny Zamyatin">Yevgeny Zamyatin</a>'s <a href="/wiki/Russian_language.html" title="Russian language">Russian</a> novel <i><a href="/wiki/We_%28novel%29.html" title="We (novel)">We</a></i> (1923), which Orwell first read in the 1940s; <a href="/wiki/James_Burnham.html" title="James Burnham">James Burnham</a>'s <i>The Managerial Revolution</i> (1940).<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a  title="">[3]</a></sup> Orwell personally told Jacintha Buddicom that at some point he might write a book in a style similar to that of <a href="/wiki/H._G._Wells.html" title="H. G. Wells">H. G. Wells</a>' <i>A Modern Utopia.</i></p>
<p>His work for the overseas service of the BBC, which at the time was under the control of the <i><a href="/wiki/Minister_of_Information.html" title="Minister of Information">Ministry of Information</a></i>, also played a significant role as the basis for his Ministry of Truth (as he later admitted to <a href="/wiki/Malcolm_Muggeridge.html" title="Malcolm Muggeridge">Malcolm Muggeridge</a>). The <i>Ministry of Information</i> building, <a href="/wiki/Senate_House_%28University_of_London%29.html" title="Senate House (University of London)">Senate House (University of London)</a>, was the Ministry of Truth's <i>architectural</i> inspiration.</p>
<p>The world of <i>Nineteen Eighty-Four</i> also reflects various aspects of the social and political life of both the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom.html" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> and the <a href="/wiki/United_States_of_America.html" title="United States of America">United States of America</a>. Orwell is reported to have said that the book described what he viewed as the situation in the United Kingdom in <a href="/wiki/1948.html" title="1948">1948</a>, when the British economy was poor, the <a href="/wiki/British_Empire.html" title="British Empire">British Empire</a> was dissolving at the same time as newspapers were reporting its triumphs, and wartime allies such as the <a href="/wiki/USSR.html" title="USSR">USSR</a> were rapidly becoming peacetime foes ('Eurasia is the enemy. Eurasia has <i>always</i> been the enemy').</p>
<p>In many ways, Oceania is indeed a future metamorphosis of the <a href="/wiki/British_Empire.html" title="British Empire">British Empire</a> (although Orwell is careful to state that, geographically, it also includes the <a href="/wiki/United_States.html" title="United States">United States</a>, and that the currency is the <a href="/wiki/Dollar.html" title="Dollar">dollar</a>). It is, as its name suggests, an essentially naval power. Much of its militarism is focused on veneration for sailors and seafarers, serving on board "floating fortresses" which Orwell evidently conceived of as the next stage in the growth of ever-bigger warships, after the <a href="/wiki/Dreadnoughts.html" title="Dreadnoughts">Dreadnoughts</a> of <a href="/wiki/WWI.html" title="WWI">WWI</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Aircraft_carriers.html" title="Aircraft carriers">aircraft carriers</a> of <a href="/wiki/WWII.html" title="WWII">WWII</a>; and much of the fighting conducted by Oceania's troops takes place in defense of <a href="/wiki/India.html" title="India">India</a> (the "Jewel in the Crown" of the British Empire).</p>
<p>The party newspaper is <i><a href="/wiki/The_Times.html" title="The Times">The Times</a></i>, identified in Orwell's time (and to some degree even at present) as the voice of the British ruling class — rather than, as could have been expected, a publication which started life as the paper of a revolutionary party (like <i><a href="/wiki/Pravda.html" title="Pravda">Pravda</a></i> in the Soviet Union).</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/O%27Brien_%28book_character%29.html" title="O'Brien (book character)">O'Brien</a>, who represents the oppressive <a href="/wiki/Party.html" title="Party">Party</a>, is in many ways depicted as a member of the old British <a href="/wiki/Ruling_class.html" title="Ruling class">ruling class</a> (in one case, <a href="/wiki/Winston_Smith.html" title="Winston Smith">Winston Smith</a> thinks of him as a person who in the past would have been holding a <a href="/wiki/Snuffbox.html" title="Snuffbox">snuffbox</a>, i.e. an old-fashioned English <a href="/wiki/Gentleman.html" title="Gentleman">gentleman</a>).</p>
<p>Orwell may also have taken a parody of Catholic dogma as part of his inspiration. For example, the term "Big Brother" may be seen as a parody of the Catholic's "Heavenly Father". Like the Catholic's "Holy Father", Orwell's "Big Brother" is an all-seeing, all-knowing figure from which the ruling classes derived their ultimate authority. Orwell suggests, gently, that Big Brother has never existed. Just as some of the more esoteric points of Catholic dogma have sometimes required that the believer disregard or devalue the physical evidence of his/her senses (such as the "miracles" of <a href="/wiki/Transsubstantiation.html" title="Transsubstantiation">Transsubstantiation</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/Odour_of_Sanctity.html" title="Odour of Sanctity">Odour of Sanctity</a>), the Party's notions of "doublethink" champion belief over rational thought.</p>

Although the storyline is unified, it could be described as having three parts (it has been published in three parts by some publishers). The first part deals with the world of Nineteen Eighty-Four as seen through the eyes of Winston; the second part deals with Winston's forbidden sexual relationship with <a href="/wiki/Julia_%281984%29.html" title="Julia (1984)">Julia</a> and his eagerness to rebel against the Party; and the third part deals with Winston's capture and torture by the Party.</p>
<p>The world described in <i>Nineteen Eighty-Four</i> contains striking parallels with the <a href="/wiki/Stalinism.html" title="Stalinism">Stalinist</a> <a href="/wiki/Soviet_Union.html" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a> and <a href="/wiki/Adolf_Hitler.html" title="Adolf Hitler">Hitler</a>'s <a href="/wiki/Nazi_Germany.html" title="Nazi Germany">Nazi Germany</a>. There are thematic similarities: the betrayed-<a href="/wiki/Revolution.html" title="Revolution">revolution</a>, with which Orwell famously dealt in <i><a href="/wiki/Animal_Farm.html" title="Animal Farm">Animal Farm</a></i>; the subordination of individuals to "the Party"; and the rigorous distinction between inner party, outer party and everyone else. There are also direct parallels of the activities within the society: leader worship, such as that towards Big Brother, who can be compared to dictators like <a href="/wiki/Stalin.html" title="Stalin">Stalin</a> and <a href="/wiki/Hitler.html" title="Hitler">Hitler</a>; Joycamps, which are a reference to <a href="/wiki/Concentration_camps.html" title="Concentration camps">concentration camps</a> or <a href="/wiki/Gulag.html" title="Gulag">gulags</a>; <a href="/wiki/Thoughtcrime.html" title="Thoughtcrime">Thought Police</a>, a reference to the <a href="/wiki/Gestapo.html" title="Gestapo">Gestapo</a> or <a href="/wiki/NKVD.html" title="NKVD">NKVD</a>; daily exercise reminiscent of Nazi propaganda movies; and the Youth League, reminiscent of <a href="/wiki/Hitler_Youth.html" title="Hitler Youth">Hitler Youth</a> or <a href="/wiki/Octobrist.html" title="Octobrist">Octobrists</a>/Pioneers.</p>
<p>There is also an extensive and institutional use of <a href="/wiki/Propaganda.html" title="Propaganda">propaganda</a>; again, this was found in the totalitarian regimes of Hitler and <a href="/wiki/Stalin.html" title="Stalin">Stalin</a>. Orwell may have drawn inspiration from the Nazis; compare the following quotes to how propaganda is used in "Nineteen Eighty-Four":</p>

<h3>Summary of plot</h3>
<p>Winston Smith, a member of the <a href="/wiki/Outer_Party.html" title="Outer Party">Outer Party</a>, lives in the <a href="/wiki/Ruins.html" title="Ruins">ruins</a> of <a href="/wiki/London.html" title="London">London</a>, the chief city of <a href="/wiki/Airstrip_One.html" title="Airstrip One">Airstrip One</a> — a front-line province of the totalitarian superstate <a href="/wiki/Oceania_%281984%29.html" title="Oceania (1984)">Oceania</a>. He grew up in post-<a href="/wiki/Second_World_War.html" title="Second World War">Second World War</a> <a href="/wiki/Britain.html" title="Britain">Britain</a>, during the <a href="/wiki/Revolution.html" title="Revolution">revolution</a> and <a href="/wiki/Civil_war.html" title="Civil war">civil war</a>. When his parents disappeared during the civil war, he was picked up by the growing <a href="/wiki/Ingsoc.html" title="Ingsoc">Ingsoc</a> (newspeak for "English Socialism") movement, placed into an orphanage and eventually given a job in the <a href="/wiki/Outer_Party.html" title="Outer Party">Outer Party</a>.</p>
<p>Winston lives a squalid existence in a one-room apartment in "Victory Mansions", and eats black bread, synthetic meals served at his workplace, and drinks industrial-grade "<a href="/wiki/Victory_Gin.html" title="Victory Gin">Victory Gin</a>." He is unhappy and keeps an illegal diary of his negative thoughts about the <a href="/wiki/Party.html" title="Party">Party</a>. This diary, along with any other eccentric behaviour, if found would result in his torture and subsequent death through the dealings of the <a href="/wiki/Thought_Police.html" title="Thought Police">Thought Police</a>. The <a href="/wiki/Thought_Police.html" title="Thought Police">Thought Police</a> have a <a href="/wiki/Telescreen.html" title="Telescreen">telescreen</a> in every household and public place, as well as hidden microphones and spies in order to catch potential thought criminals who could endanger the sanctity of the Party.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Ministry_of_Truth.html" title="Ministry of Truth">Ministry of Truth</a>, which exercises complete control over all media in Oceania, employs Winston at the Ministry's Records Department, where he doctors historical records in order to comply with the Party's version of the past. Since the events of the present constantly shape the perception of the past, the task is a never-ending one.</p>
<p>While Winston likes his work, especially the intellectual challenge involved in fabricating a complete historical anecdote from scratch, he is also fascinated by the <i>real</i> past, and eagerly tries to find out more about the forbidden truth. At the Ministry of Truth, he encounters <a href="/wiki/Julia_%281984%29.html" title="Julia (1984)">Julia</a>, a mechanic on the novel-writing machines, and the two begin an illegal relationship, regularly meeting up in the countryside (away from surveillance) or in a room above an antique shop in the <a href="/wiki/Proles.html" title="Proles">Proles</a>' area of the city. The owner of the shop exchanges various facts on the mysterious pre-revolutionary past with Winston and sells him artifacts from this period, as well as illegally renting the room. Julia and Winston find their new hiding place a paradise, as there is no <a href="/wiki/Telescreen.html" title="Telescreen">telescreen</a> and so they believe themselves completely alone and safe.</p>
<p>As their relationship progresses, Winston's views begin to change, and he finds himself relentlessly questioning <a href="/wiki/Ingsoc.html" title="Ingsoc">Ingsoc</a>. Unknown to the two (or to the reader), he and Julia are under surveillance by the <a href="/wiki/Thought_Police.html" title="Thought Police">Thought Police</a>. When he is approached by <a href="/wiki/Inner_Party.html" title="Inner Party">Inner Party</a> member <a href="/wiki/O%27Brien_%28book_character%29.html" title="O'Brien (book character)">O'Brien</a>, Winston believes that he has made contact with the Resistance or Brotherhood which is opposed to the ideals of the Party. O'Brien gives Winston a copy of "the book", a searing criticism of <a href="/wiki/Ingsoc.html" title="Ingsoc">Ingsoc</a> believed by Smith to have been written by the dissident <a href="/wiki/Emmanuel_Goldstein.html" title="Emmanuel Goldstein">Emmanuel Goldstein</a>, leader of the Brotherhood.</p>
<p>Winston and Julia are eventually, and unavoidably apprehended by the Thought Police in their supposed sanctuary, which actually contains a hidden <a href="/wiki/Telescreen.html" title="Telescreen">telescreen</a>, and are then interrogated separately in the Ministry of Love, where opponents of the regime are tortured and executed. O'Brien is there, and reveals to Winston that he has been brought to "be cured" of his hatred for the Party, and subjects Winston to numerous torture sessions. During one of these sessions, he explains to Winston the nature of the endless world war, and that the purpose of the torture is not to extract a fake confession, but to alter the way that Winston thinks.</p>
<p>This is achieved through a combination of torture and <a href="/wiki/Electroshock_therapy.html" title="Electroshock therapy">electroshock therapy</a>, until O'Brien decides that Winston is "cured". However, Winston unconsciously utters Julia's name in his sleep, proving that he has not been completely brainwashed. <a href="/wiki/Room_101.html" title="Room 101">Room 101</a> is the most feared room in the Ministry of Love, where a person's greatest fear is forced upon them as the final step in their "re-education." Since Winston is morbidly afraid of rats, a cage of the hungry vermin is placed over his eyes, so that when the door is opened, they will eat their way through his skull. All he has to do in order to end the torment is to deny his love for Julia by having any pains transferred onto her, something which he swore he could never do.</p>
<p>In terror, as the cage is placed onto his head, he screams, "Do it to Julia!" to stop the torture. At the end of the novel, Winston and Julia again meet, but their feelings for each other have been destroyed. Winston has become an alcoholic and he knows that eventually he will be killed. The one thing Winston had held on to was his hatred of Big Brother, which he felt would be his victory over the party's otherwise absolute power. However, by the end of the novel, we see that the torture and 'reprogramming' have been successful, because Winston realizes that "He loved Big Brother."</p>
<p>At the end of the novel there is an appendix on <a href="/wiki/Newspeak.html" title="Newspeak">Newspeak</a> (the artificial language invented and, by degrees, imposed by the Party <a href="/wiki/Sapir-Whorf_hypothesis.html" title="Sapir-Whorf hypothesis">to limit the capacity to express or even think "unorthodox" thoughts</a>), in the style of an academic essay.</p>

<p>The novel does not give a full history of how the world of 1984 came into being. Winston's recollections, and what he reads from "The Book" (i.e., <a href="/wiki/Emmanuel_Goldstein.html" title="Emmanuel Goldstein">Goldstein</a>'s book) reveal that at some point after the <a href="/wiki/Second_World_War.html" title="Second World War">Second World War</a>, the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom.html" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> descended into civil war, eventually becoming part of the new world power of Oceania. At roughly the same time, the <a href="/wiki/Soviet_Union.html" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a> expanded into mainland <a href="/wiki/Europe.html" title="Europe">Europe</a> to form <a href="/wiki/Eurasia.html" title="Eurasia">Eurasia</a>; and the third world power, <a href="/wiki/Eastasia.html" title="Eastasia">Eastasia</a> — an amalgamation of east <a href="/wiki/Asia.html" title="Asia">Asian</a> countries including <a href="/wiki/China.html" title="China">China</a> and <a href="/wiki/Japan.html" title="Japan">Japan</a> — emerged some time later.</p>
<p>There was a period of <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_warfare.html" title="Nuclear warfare">nuclear warfare</a> during which some hundreds of atomic bombs were dropped, mainly on <a href="/wiki/Europe.html" title="Europe">Europe</a>, western <a href="/wiki/Russia.html" title="Russia">Russia</a>, and <a href="/wiki/North_America.html" title="North America">North America</a>. (The only city that is explicitly stated to have suffered a nuclear attack is <a href="/wiki/Colchester.html" title="Colchester">Colchester</a>.) It is not clear what came first — the civil war which ended with the Party taking over, the merging of the British Empire and the US, or the external war in which Colchester was bombed.</p>
<p>In articles written during the <a href="/wiki/Second_World_War.html" title="Second World War">Second World War</a>, Orwell repeatedly expressed the idea that British <a href="/wiki/Democracy.html" title="Democracy">democracy</a> as it existed before <a href="/wiki/1939.html" title="1939">1939</a> would not survive the war, the only question being whether its end would come through a <a href="/wiki/Fascist.html" title="Fascist">Fascist</a> takeover from above or by a <a href="/wiki/Socialist.html" title="Socialist">Socialist</a> <a href="/wiki/Revolution.html" title="Revolution">revolution</a> from below. (The second possibility, it should be noted, was greatly supported and hoped for by Orwell, to the extent that he joined and loyally participated in "the Home Guard" throughout the war, in the expectation that that body would become the nucleus of a <a href="/wiki/Revolutionary.html" title="Revolutionary">revolutionary</a> <a href="/wiki/Militia.html" title="Militia">militia</a>). After the war ended Orwell openly expressed his surprise that events had proven him wrong.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a  title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: English Socialism">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="English_Socialism" id="English_Socialism"></a></p>
<h3>English Socialism</h3>
<p>The most complete expression of Orwell's predictions in that direction is contained in "<a href="/wiki/The_Lion_and_the_Unicorn.html" title="The Lion and the Unicorn">The Lion and the Unicorn</a>" which he wrote in <a href="/wiki/1940.html" title="1940">1940</a>. There, he stated that "the war and the revolution are inseparable (...) the fact that we are at war has turned Socialism from a textbook word into a realizable policy". The reason for that, according to Orwell, was that the outmoded British <a href="/wiki/Class_system.html" title="Class system">class system</a> constituted a major hindrance to the war effort, and only a Socialist society would be able to defeat <a href="/wiki/Hitler.html" title="Hitler">Hitler</a>. Since the <a href="/wiki/Middle_classes.html" title="Middle classes">middle classes</a> were in process of realizing this, too, they would support the revolution, and only the most outright <a href="/wiki/Reactionary.html" title="Reactionary">Reactionary</a> elements in British society would oppose it — which would limit the amount of force the revolutionaries would need in order to gain power and keep it.</p>
<p>Thus, an "English Socialism" would come about which "...will never lose touch with the tradition of compromise and the belief in a law that is above the State. It will shoot traitors, but it will give them a solemn trial beforehand and occasionally it will acquit them. It will crush any open revolt promptly and cruelly, but it will interfere very little with the spoken and written word".</p>
<p>Such a revolutionary regime, which Orwell found highly desirable and was actively trying to bring about in <a href="/wiki/1940.html" title="1940">1940</a>, is of course a far cry from the monstrous edifice presided over by Big Brother, which was his nightmare a few years later. Still, one can see how the one may degenerate into the other (and The Party does provide "traitors" with "a solemn trial" before shooting them...)</p>
<p>The term "<a href="/wiki/England.html" title="England">English</a> Socialism", repeated numerous times in "The Lion and the Unicorn", is rather parochial — had events developed as Orwell predicted, the <a href="/wiki/Scots.html" title="Scots">Scots</a> and <a href="/wiki/Wales.html" title="Wales">Welsh</a> would have undoubtedly had a major share in such a revolution. Its importance for understanding "1984" is that the official Party ideology is "Ingsoc", an abbreviation of "English Socialism". This shows that Orwell perceived of the monstrous regime that he described in “1984”, as not only a betrayal and perversion of <a href="/wiki/Socialist.html" title="Socialist">Socialist</a> ideals in general, but also as a perversion of Orwell’s own specifically and dearly cherished vision and hope of <a href="/wiki/Socialism.html" title="Socialism">Socialism</a>. <sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a  title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/1940.html" title="1940">1940</a> Orwell was quite optimistic about the chances of Socialism — his brand of Socialism. In <a href="/wiki/1947.html" title="1947">1947</a>, when he wrote "Toward European Unity" he was far more pessimistic (which may have had to do, not only with objective conditions in the world, but also with his fast deteriorating health). He no longer had hopes in the possibility of a Socialist revolution in Britain alone. The only real chance (and he considered it a slim chance) was through a <a href="/wiki/Socialist.html" title="Socialist">Socialist</a> <a href="/wiki/Federation.html" title="Federation">Federation</a> of <a href="/wiki/Western_Europe.html" title="Western Europe">Western Europe</a>, "The only region where for a large number of people the word Socialism is bound up with <a href="/wiki/Liberty.html" title="Liberty">liberty</a>, <a href="/wiki/Social_equality.html" title="Social equality">equality</a> and <a href="/wiki/Internationalism.html" title="Internationalism">internationalism</a>". Such a federation, embracing some 250 million people, would provide a large-scale working model of "a community where people are relatively free and happy and where the main motive in life is not the pursuit of money or power".</p>
<p>Many preconditions had to be fulfilled for that vision to materialise. The <a href="/wiki/Western_European.html" title="Western European">Western European</a> countries had to remain independent both of the Soviet military might and of looking to the <a href="/wiki/Soviet_Union.html" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a> for their model of Socialism. Britain had to divest itself of its empire, since exploiting the labour of colonial masses was incompatible with building a true Socialist society. It also had to cut itself completely out of the <a href="/wiki/United_States.html" title="United States">American</a> orbit, and ally with the West European countries in a common revolution. Orwell was not sanguine about the chances of all these conditions materialising, but stated in conclusion, "One thing in our favour is that a major war is not likely to happen immediately" — which would at least give some breathing space to the forces seeking <a href="/wiki/Democratic_Socialism.html" title="Democratic Socialism">Democratic Socialism</a>.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a  title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>"Nineteen Eighty-Four" was written at almost precisely the same time as "Toward European Unity", and the fictional history unfolding in the past of the novel could be considered as the exact mirror image of that article. A major war does break out almost "immediately" from the time of writing in 1948, the opposite happens of all the indispensable conditions for Democratic Socialism, and things deteriorate.</p>
<p>From the memories of Winston, scattered through the book, one can try to piece out the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>At the outbreak of war, when <a href="/wiki/Colchester.html" title="Colchester">Colchester</a> was A-bombed, the child Winston experienced an air-raid alarm and his parents took him to a <a href="/wiki/Tube.html" title="Tube">tube</a> station, where he heard an old man saying, "We didn't ought to 'ave trusted them". This implies a sense of betrayal, felt in the British public in the aftermath of a surprise attack. The context would suggest a <a href="/wiki/Soviet.html" title="Soviet">Soviet</a> attack, possibly after a period of relative rapprochement or a failed peace effort.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>The outbreak of war might have followed the withdrawal of US forces from Europe — a quite plausible future development when the book was written, before the creation of <a href="/wiki/NATO.html" title="NATO">NATO</a> and when the main available precedent was the American withdrawal from Europe in the aftermath of WWI. That would account both for the feeling of betrayal and for the Soviet success in sweeping, while Britain was heavily bombed but protected by the Channel from a ground invasion, westwards to the <a href="/wiki/Atlantic.html" title="Atlantic">Atlantic</a> and southwards into the <a href="/wiki/Middle_East.html" title="Middle East">Middle East</a>. (A newsreel from the <a href="/wiki/Middle_East.html" title="Middle East">Middle East</a> which Smith watches shows a boat full of <a href="/wiki/Jewish.html" title="Jewish">Jewish</a> <a href="/wiki/Refugees.html" title="Refugees">refugees</a> being sunk by an Oceanian helicopter; evidently, in this history the state of <a href="/wiki/Israel.html" title="Israel">Israel</a>, founded in 1948, had had only an ephemeral existence.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The major invasion was followed by the <a href="/wiki/Soviet_Union.html" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a> being transformed into "Eurasia" and adopting the ideology of "Neo-Bolshevism" (possibly under the impact of absorbing the <a href="/wiki/Communists.html" title="Communists">Communists</a> of <a href="/wiki/France.html" title="France">France</a>, <a href="/wiki/Italy.html" title="Italy">Italy</a> etc. into its ruling party).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The isolated Britain kept its empire and was perforce drawn into a closer alliance and eventual political amalgamation with the <a href="/wiki/United_States.html" title="United States">United States</a> — that might have been the time when the <a href="/wiki/Dollar.html" title="Dollar">dollar</a> became the common currency.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>At that time, Winston's father was still around and his sister was not yet born. The time must be the early 1950s, since he was born in 1944 or 1945 and these are for him dim childhood memories; in other words, for Orwell writing in <a href="/wiki/1948.html" title="1948">1948</a> this was in the very near future. Winston is about the same age as Richard Horatio Blair, Orwell's adopted son, who was born in May <a href="/wiki/1944.html" title="1944">1944</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>After that, the war in Europe seems to have stabilized into exchanges of aerial bombardments (by tacit agreement avoiding the use of nuclear arms) and to naval blockades and submarine warfare, with ground battles confined to extra-European theatres. In effect, Orwell conceived the future war as taking virtually the same course that WWII took in <a href="/wiki/1940.html" title="1940">1940</a> after the <a href="/wiki/Fall_of_France.html" title="Fall of France">Fall of France</a>. This is the period from which come Winston's later childhood memories, a time when the father was gone and the mother was left alone with Winston and the baby sister.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>That was a time of very great economic privations — much worse even than the systematised and controlled privations which daily life in 1984 Oceania entails. There was presumably the destruction left by nuclear bombardment, which destroyed a part of Britain's industrial capacity, and also left agricultural areas contaminated ("1984" mentions Winston and Julia meeting in countryside areas still devastated and deserted after 30 years), the need to fight a full-scale war again without being fully recovered from the effects of WWII (in our history Britain only fully recovered in the 1950s, and in 1948 when Orwell wrote, there were predictions of a much longer time needed for recovery).</dd>
</dl>
<p>To these would be added Soviet/Eurasian attacks on the supply lines, for which (unlike with <a href="/wiki/Nazi_Germany.html" title="Nazi Germany">Nazi Germany</a> in WWII) the coasts of <a href="/wiki/Spain.html" title="Spain">Spain</a>, <a href="/wiki/Portugal.html" title="Portugal">Portugal</a> and <a href="/wiki/North_Africa.html" title="North Africa">North Africa</a>, as well as those of <a href="/wiki/France.html" title="France">France</a>, would be fully available for Soviet/Eurasian submarine bases and airfields. (The development of the "virtually unsinkable" Floating Fortresses might have come later, as a means of securing the <a href="/wiki/Atlantic.html" title="Atlantic">Atlantic</a> sea-lanes and ensuring at least a trickle of vital supplies to <a href="/wiki/Britain.html" title="Britain">Britain</a>/<a href="/wiki/Airstrip_One.html" title="Airstrip One">Airstrip One</a> — which would explain the popularity of the sailors serving in these fortresses, used in the Party's propaganda. The Floating Fortresses might have been inspired by <a href="/wiki/WWII.html" title="WWII">WWII</a> <a href="/wiki/Project_Habakkuk.html" title="Project Habakkuk">Project Habakkuk</a>'s virtually unsinkable reinforced ice aircraft carriers, if Orwell had heard of them.)</p>
<p>Winston's memories of this time are full of political chaos and violence, as seen through an uncomprehending child's eyes. There is a specific mention of rival militias roaming the streets, each one composed of boys all wearing shirts of the same colour (a vision which Orwell might have taken from the last years of <a href="/wiki/Weimar_Germany.html" title="Weimar Germany">Weimar Germany</a>, where <a href="/wiki/Nazism.html" title="Nazism">Nazi</a>, <a href="/wiki/Communist.html" title="Communist">Communist</a> and other militias constantly fought in the streets).</p>
<p>That corresponds, presumably, to the time when The Party (which at the time must still have had a name, being only one of several contending parties) was led by Jones, Aaronson, and Rutherford, and Big Brother had not yet risen to prominence. (The three are clearly modelled on <a href="/wiki/Bukharin.html" title="Bukharin">Bukharin</a>, <a href="/wiki/Zinoviev.html" title="Zinoviev">Zinoviev</a> and <a href="/wiki/Kamenev.html" title="Kamenev">Kamenev</a>, the prominent <a href="/wiki/Bolshevik.html" title="Bolshevik">Bolshevik</a> leaders whom <a href="/wiki/Stalin.html" title="Stalin">Stalin</a> supplanted and executed).</p>
<p>Apparently, Orwell conceives of the three as sincere revolutionaries moved by outrage at the injustice of <a href="/wiki/Capitalism.html" title="Capitalism">capitalism</a>. There is the specific mention of Rutherford's "brutal cartoons", depicting slum tenements, starving children, street battles and <a href="/wiki/Capitalists.html" title="Capitalists">capitalists</a> in <a href="/wiki/Top_hats.html" title="Top hats">top hats</a>, which "helped inflame popular opinion before and during the Revolution". The revolutionaries eventually win — or so it seems. What Orwell hoped for in vain during WWII does take place during the WWIII of the <a href="/wiki/1950s.html" title="1950s">1950s</a>, Orwell's immediate future — a revolution in Britain. But now he sees it as the beginning of a nightmare, not of hope.</p>
<p>The difference can be partly explained by the fact that the revolution takes place in far more brutal conditions than those of WWII Britain where Orwell hoped for a relatively mild revolution — and more similar to the conditions of <a href="/wiki/1917.html" title="1917">1917</a> in <a href="/wiki/Russia.html" title="Russia">Russia</a> from which the incipient <a href="/wiki/Soviet.html" title="Soviet">Soviet</a> regime had its introduction to brutality. While Rutherford's cartoons were obviously exaggerated, in order to be so effective in rousing public fury they must have reflected, to some degree, the reality of deep privations and social polarization in the immediate pre-revolutionary time.</p>
<p>Under such conditions, the revolutionaries' victory could have easily been accompanied by widespread retaliations against "war profiteers" and "fat cats" (there was widespread resentment against such people in WWII Britain). Such retaliations, condoned as "unavoidable excesses", would have set the new regime on a road of arbitrary brutality from its very inception.</p>
<p>Also, Orwell's essential conditions for the revolution to develop towards <a href="/wiki/Democratic_Socialism.html" title="Democratic Socialism">Democratic Socialism</a>, set out in "Toward European Unity", were all not fulfilled — <a href="/wiki/Western_Europe.html" title="Western Europe">Western Europe</a> is occupied and in no condition to join in the revolution, and <a href="/wiki/Britain.html" title="Britain">Britain</a> is inextricably tied to both the <a href="/wiki/United_States.html" title="United States">U.S.</a> and to its oppressive overseas empire. Indeed, the brutal all-out exploitation of <a href="/wiki/Colonial.html" title="Colonial">colonial</a> peoples as semi-<a href="/wiki/Slave_labor.html" title="Slave labor">slave labour</a> could have been started by the old regime in the immediate aftermath of the occupation of <a href="/wiki/Europe.html" title="Europe">Europe</a>, as a desperate measure of survival, and deepened rather than abolished by the newly arrived revolutionaries. Altogether, the revolutionary regime was inexorably perverted into the merciless tyranny of Big Brother.</p>
<p>At some time soon after, the revolution, which started in <a href="/wiki/Britain.html" title="Britain">Britain</a>, spread to the <a href="/wiki/United_States.html" title="United States">United States</a> and won there as well. This is simply mentioned, with no detail and no information of the situation in the <a href="/wiki/United_States.html" title="United States">American</a> part of Oceania beyond a passing mention of a Party congress in <a href="/wiki/New_York.html" title="New York">New York</a> and a reference in "The Book" to "Jews, Negroes and South Americans of pure Indian blood" being "found in the highest ranks of the Party". The Americas are not part of this story any more than the detailed history of <a href="/wiki/China.html" title="China">China</a>; it is just a faraway place of which almost no information is given.</p>
<p>The later history of Oceania seems modelled, in a rather one-to-one basis, on <a href="/wiki/Soviet.html" title="Soviet">Soviet</a> history. Oceania's 1950s are based on the Soviet <a href="/wiki/1920s.html" title="1920s">1920s</a>, a time of civil war and revolutionary turmoil. Similarly, the 1960s are the <a href="/wiki/1930s.html" title="1930s">1930s</a>, the time when Stalin/Big Brother, consolidated his power and smothered all opposition. (Stalin's <a href="/wiki/Moscow_Trials.html" title="Moscow Trials">Moscow Show Trials</a> took place in 1936, Big Brother's equivalent in <a href="/wiki/1965.html" title="1965">1965</a>). By the end of the <a href="/wiki/1960.html" title="1960">1960s</a>, Big Brother has completed the process of turning the revolution into a pretext for creating a terror state.</p>
<p>By the year 1984, the citizens of Oceania had been separated into three distinct, isolated classes — the <a href="/wiki/Inner_Party.html" title="Inner Party">Inner Party</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Outer_Party.html" title="Outer Party">Outer Party</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/Proles.html" title="Proles">proles</a>. However, in the view of <a href="/wiki/Emmanuel_Goldstein.html" title="Emmanuel Goldstein">Emmanuel Goldstein</a> (which seems to be Orwell's) these are but new names for classes which have essentially existed throughout human history — though under the new dispensation they are more rigid and unchangeable than ever before.</p>
<p>On the global level, as "The Book" (supposedly written by <a href="/wiki/Emmanuel_Goldstein.html" title="Emmanuel Goldstein">Emmanuel Goldstein</a> though in fact its descriptive part turns out to be endorsed by the Party) explains, the three powers eventually realized that continuous stalemate war was preferable to conquest, as war allowed them to spend their surplus labour manufacturing products that would be wasted during fighting, rather than improving people's standards of living (an impoverished population being easier to control than a rich one).</p>
<p>By the time the novel is set, the three powers have taken over most of the world, but they still fight over a large area. This area, containing the northern half of <a href="/wiki/Africa.html" title="Africa">Africa</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Middle_East.html" title="Middle East">Middle East</a>, southern <a href="/wiki/India.html" title="India">India</a>, <a href="/wiki/Indonesia.html" title="Indonesia">Indonesia</a>, and northern <a href="/wiki/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australia</a>, provides <a href="/wiki/Slavery.html" title="Slavery">slaves</a>, or low-paid workers who are effectively slaves, for all three powers.</p>
<p>The powers rarely if ever fight on their own territory — <a href="/wiki/Airstrip_One.html" title="Airstrip One">Airstrip One</a> (the official name of <a href="/wiki/Great_Britain.html" title="Great Britain">Great Britain</a>) has become the target of Eurasian rocket bombs. But, as Julia herself expresses, it is hinted that the Oceanian government itself may launch these weapons in order to convince the population that it is under constant attack.</p>

<h3>Ministries of Oceania</h3>
<p>Oceania's four ministries are housed in huge pyramidal structures, each roughly 300 metres high and visible throughout London, displaying the three slogans of the party (see below) on their facades.</p>
<dl>
<dt><a href="/wiki/Ministry_of_Peace.html" title="Ministry of Peace">The Ministry of Peace</a>&#160;</dt>
<dd>Newspeak: <i>Minipax</i>.<br />
Concerns itself with conducting Oceania's perpetual wars.</dd>
<dt><a href="/wiki/Ministry_of_Plenty.html" title="Ministry of Plenty">The Ministry of Plenty</a>&#160;</dt>
<dd>Newspeak: <i>Miniplenty</i>.<br />
Responsible for rationing and controlling food and goods.</dd>
<dt><a href="/wiki/Ministry_of_Truth.html" title="Ministry of Truth">The Ministry of Truth</a>&#160;</dt>
<dd>Newspeak: <i>Minitrue</i>.<br />
The propaganda arm of Oceania's regime. Minitrue controls information: political literature, the Party organization, and the telescreens. Winston Smith works for Minitrue, "rectifying" historical records and newspaper articles to make them conform to Big Brother's most recent pronouncements, thus making everything that the Party says true.</dd>
<dt><a href="/wiki/Ministry_of_Love.html" title="Ministry of Love">The Ministry of Love</a>&#160;</dt>
<dd>Newspeak: <i>Miniluv</i>.<br />
The agency responsible for the identification, monitoring, arrest, and torture of dissidents, real or imagined. Based on Winston's experience there at the hands of O'Brien, the basic procedure is to pair the subject with his or her worst fear for an extended period, eventually breaking down the person's mental faculties and ending with a sincere embrace of the Party by the brainwashed subject. The Ministry of Love differs from the other ministry buildings in that it has no windows in it at all.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The ministries' names are <a href="/wiki/Ironic.html" title="Ironic">ironic</a> — the Ministry of Peace concerns itself with war, the Ministry of Plenty: starvation, the Ministry of Truth: lies, and the Ministry of Love: torture. However, from the perspectives of the Oceanians who accept the propaganda, these names are accurate.</p>

<td>The ideal set up by the Party was something huge, terrible and glittering—a world of steel and concrete of monstrous marching and terrifying weapons—a nation of warriors and fanatics, marching forward in perfect unity, all thinking the same thoughts and shouting the same slogans, perpetually working, fighting, triumphing, persecuting—three hundred million people all with the same face. The reality was decaying, dingy cities where underfed people shuffled to and fro in leaky shoes, in patched-up nineteenth-century houses that smelt always of cabbage and bad lavatories. He seemed to see a vision of London, vast and ruinous, city of a million dustbins, and mixed up with it was a picture of Mrs Parsons, a woman with a lined face and wispy hair, fiddling helplessly with a blocked wastepipe.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a  title="">[9]</a></sup></td>

<p>In his novel, Orwell created a world in which citizens have no right to a personal life or to personal thought. Leisure and other activities are controlled through a system of strict mores.

</div>
</div>
<p>The mysterious head of government is the omniscient, omnipotent, beloved Big Brother, or "B.B.", usually displayed on posters with the slogan "BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU". However, it is never quite clear whether Big Brother truly exists, or whether he is a fictitious leader created as a focus for the love of the Party which the Thought Police and others are there to engender (it is possible that he is real, but we — and the book's characters — never know for certain). It is perfectly possible that the conflict between Big Brother and <a href="/wiki/Emmanuel_Goldstein.html" title="Emmanuel Goldstein">Emmanuel Goldstein</a> is in fact a conflict either between two fictitious or dead leaders, whose true purpose is to personify both the Party and its opponents.</p>
<p>His political opponent (who is therefore a criminal) is the hated Goldstein, a Party member who the reader is told had been in league with Big Brother and the Party during the revolution. Goldstein is said to be the leader of the Brotherhood, a vast underground anti-Party fellowship. The reader never truly finds out whether the Brotherhood exists or not, but the implication is that Goldstein is either entirely fictitious or was eliminated long ago. Party members are expected to vilify Goldstein, the Brotherhood and whichever superstate Oceania is currently warring via the daily "<a href="/wiki/Two_Minutes_Hate.html" title="Two Minutes Hate">Two Minutes Hate</a>."</p>
<p>A typical two-minutes hate is depicted in the novel, during which citizens ridicule and shout at a video of the hated "bleating" Goldstein as he releases a litany of attacks upon Oceanic governance (indeed, the image ultimately morphs into a bleating sheep) on a background of enemy soldiers (in the book's portrayal of the two minutes they are Eurasian, but after the switch to the war with Eastasia, it is expected that the background changes to Eastasian soldiers).</p>
<p>The three <a href="/wiki/Slogan.html" title="Slogan">slogans</a> of the Party, on display everywhere, are:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>WAR IS PEACE</b></li>
<li><b>FREEDOM IS SLAVERY</b></li>
<li><b>IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these is of course either contradictory or the opposite of what we normally believe, and in <i>1984,</i> the world is in a state of constant war, no one is free, and everyone is ignorant. The slogans are analysed in <a href="/wiki/Goldstein%27s_book.html" title="Goldstein's book">Goldstein's book</a>. Though logically insensible, the slogans <i>do</i> embody the Party. For instance, through constant "war", the Party can keep domestic peace; when freedom is brought about, the people are enslaved to it, and the ignorance of the people is the strength of the Party. If (like Winston) anybody becomes <i>too</i> smart, they are whisked away for fear of rebellion. Through their constant repetition, the terms become meaningless, and the slogans become <a href="/wiki/Axiom.html" title="Axiom">axiomatic</a>. This type of misuse of language, and the deliberate self-deception with which the citizens are encouraged to accept it, is called <a href="/wiki/Doublethink.html" title="Doublethink">doublethink</a>.</p>
<p>One essential consequence of doublethink is that the Party can rewrite history with impunity, for "The Party is never wrong." The ultimate aim of the Party is, according to O'Brien, to gain and retain full power over all the people of Oceania; he sums this up with perhaps the most distressing prophecy of the entire novel: <i>If you want a picture of the future, imagine a boot stamping on a human face — for ever.</i></p>

<p>The world of <i>Nineteen Eighty-Four</i> is built around an never-ending war involving the book's three superstates, with two allied powers fighting against the third. But as <a href="/wiki/Goldstein%27s_book.html" title="Goldstein's book">Goldstein's book</a> explains, each superstate is so strong it cannot be defeated even when faced with the combined forces of the other two powers. The allied states occasionally split with each other and new alliances are formed. Each time this happens, history is rewritten to convince the people that the new alliances were always there, using the principles of <i>doublethink</i>. The war itself never takes place in the territories of the three powers; the actual fighting is conducted in the disputed zone stretching from Morocco to Australia, and in the unpopulated Arctic wastes. Throughout the first half of the novel, <a href="/wiki/Oceania.html" title="Oceania">Oceania</a> is allied with <a href="/wiki/Eastasia.html" title="Eastasia">Eastasia</a>, and Oceania's forces are combating <a href="/wiki/Eurasia.html" title="Eurasia">Eurasia</a>'s troops in northern Africa.</p>
<p>Mid-way through the book, the alliance breaks apart and Oceania, newly allied with Eurasia, begins a campaign against Eastasian forces in <a href="/wiki/India.html" title="India">India</a>. During "Hate Week" (a week of extreme focus on the evilness of Oceania's enemies, the purpose of which is to stir up patriotic fervor in support of the Party), Oceania and Eurasia are enemies once again. The public is quite abnormally blind to the change, and when a public orator, mid-sentence, changes the name of the enemy from Eurasia to Eastasia (still speaking as if nothing had changed), the people are shocked as they notice all the <a href="/wiki/Flag.html" title="Flag">flags</a> and <a href="/wiki/Banners.html" title="Banners">banners</a> are wrong (they blame Goldstein and the Brotherhood) and literally tear them down.</p>
<p>The book that Winston and Julia receive explains that the war is unwinnable, and that its only purpose is to use up human labor and the fruits of human labor so that each superstate's economy cannot support an equal (and high) standard of living for every citizen. The book also details an Oceanian strategy to attack enemy cities with atomic-tipped rocket bombs prior to a full-scale invasion, but quickly dismisses this plan as both infeasible and contrary to the purpose of the war.</p>
<p>Although, according to Goldstein's book, hundreds of atomic bombs were dropped on cities during the 1950s, the three powers no longer use them, as they would upset the balance of power. Conventional military technology is little different from that used in the Second World War. Some advances have been made, such as replacing bomber aircraft with "rocket bombs", and using immense "floating fortresses" instead of battleships, but such advances appear to be rare. As the purpose of the war is to destroy manufactured products and thus keep the workers busy, obsolete and wasteful technology is deliberately used in order to perpetuate useless fighting.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Goldstein%27s_book.html" title="Goldstein's book">Goldstein's book</a> hints that, in fact, there may not actually <i>be</i> a war. The only view of the outside world presented in the novel is through <a href="/wiki/Oceania_%281984%29.html" title="Oceania (1984)">Oceania</a>'s media, which has an obvious tendency to exaggerate and even fabricate "facts". Goldstein's book suggests that the three superpowers may not actually be warring, and as Oceania's media provide completely unbelievable news reports on impossibly long military campaigns and victories (including a ridiculously large campaign in the <a href="/wiki/Sahara_desert.html" title="Sahara desert">Sahara desert</a>), it can be suggested that the war, in fact, is a lie. However, as with many facets of the novel, the disputed existence of a war is neither confirmed nor denied, and the reader cannot be sure whether a war actually is in progress. In fact, it is entirely possible that the other two powers themselves are fabrications, and the entire world is controlled by a single entity.</p>
<p>It is noted in the novel that there are no longer massive battles, but rather expert fighters occasionally appearing in small skirmishes. This may be relatively paradoxical considering the massive amounts of resources wasted to keep the war effort running, given that so few soldiers are actually fighting.</p>

<h3>Living standards</h3>
<p>By the year 1984, the society of Airstrip One lives in abject squalor and poverty. Hunger, disease, and filth have become the social norm. As a result of the civil war, atomic wars, and Eurasian rocket bombs, the urban areas of Airstrip One lie in ruins. When travelling around <a href="/wiki/London.html" title="London">London</a>, Winston is surrounded by rubble, decay, and the crumbling shells of wrecked buildings.</p>
<p>Apart from the gargantuan bombproof Ministries, very little seems to have been done to rebuild London, and it is assumed that all towns and cities across Airstrip One are in the same desperate condition. Living standards for the population are generally very low — everything is in short supply and those goods that are available are of very poor quality. The Party claims that this is due to the immense sacrifices that must be made for the war effort. They are partially correct, since the point of continuous warfare is to be rid of the surplus of industrial production to prevent the rise of the standard of living and make possible the economic repression of people.</p>
<p>The Inner Party, at the top level of Oceanian society, enjoys the highest standard of living. O'Brien, a member of the Inner Party, lives in a relatively clean and comfortable apartment, and has access to a variety of quality foodstuffs such as <a href="/wiki/Wine.html" title="Wine">wine</a>, <a href="/wiki/Coffee.html" title="Coffee">coffee</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Sugar.html" title="Sugar">sugar</a>, none of which is available to the rest of the population. Members of the Inner Party also seem to be waited on by slaves captured from the disputed zone.</p>
<p>Although the Inner Party enjoys the highest standard of living, Goldstein's book points out that, despite being at the top of society, their living standards are far, far below those of society's elite before the revolution. The proles, treated by the Party as animals, live in squalor and poverty. They are kept sedate with vast quantities of cheap <a href="/wiki/Beer.html" title="Beer">beer</a>, widespread <a href="/wiki/Pornography.html" title="Pornography">pornography</a>, and a national <a href="/wiki/Lottery.html" title="Lottery">lottery</a>, but these do not mask the fact that their lives are dangerous and deprived — proletarian areas of the cities, for example, are ridden with disease and vermin.</p>
<p>However, the proles are subject to much less close control of their daily lives than Party members, and the proles, which Winston Smith meets in the streets, and in the pubs seem to speak and behave much like working-class Englishmen of Orwell's time. In addition, the prole criminals whom he meets in the first phase of his imprisonment are far less subdued and intimidated than the intellectual "politicals", some of them rudely jeering at the telescreens with apparent impunity.</p>
<p>As explained in Goldstein's book, this derives from the social theory which the regime believes in — and which seems to work in the framework of the book — namely, that revolutions are always started by the middle class and that the lower classes would never start an effective rebellion on their own. Therefore, if the middle classes are so tightly controlled that the regime can penetrate their very thoughts and their most minute daily life, the lower classes can be left to their own devices and pose no threat.</p>
<p>As Winston is a member of the Outer Party, we discover more about the Outer Party's living standards than any other group. Despite being the middle class of Oceanian society, the Outer Party's standard of living is very poor. Foodstuffs are low quality or synthetic; the main alcoholic beverage — Victory Gin — is industrial-grade; Outer Party <a href="/wiki/Cigarette.html" title="Cigarette">cigarettes</a> are shoddy.</p>

<p><a name="Nationalism" id="Nationalism"></a></p>
<h3>Nationalism</h3>
<p>Nineteen Eighty-Four expands upon the subjects summarised in Orwell’s preparatory essay, [<a  class="external text" title="http://orwell.ru/library/essays/nationalism/|Notes">on Nationalism</a>] (<a href="/wiki/1945_in_literature.html" title="1945 in literature">1945</a>): <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.resort.com/~prime8/Orwell/nationalism.html">[1]</a>. In it, Orwell expresses frustration at the lack of vocabulary needed to explain an unrecognised phenomenon that he felt was behind certain forces. He addresses this problem in Nineteen Eighty-Four by inventing the jargon of <a href="/wiki/Newspeak.html" title="Newspeak">Newspeak</a>.</p>
<p>A fictional society, to which the readers have no preconceived bias, was a tool in illustrating why Orwell thought examples shown below were different manifestations of the same forces at work, despite their being ideologically incompatible.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Positive nationalism">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Positive_nationalism" id="Positive_nationalism"></a></p>
<h4>Positive nationalism</h4>
<p>This is apparent in the novel, in the Oceanians’ undying love for Big Brother, whose physical existence is doubtful. Orwell lists <a href="/wiki/Celtic_Nationalism.html" title="Celtic Nationalism">Celtic Nationalism</a>, Neo-Toryism and <a href="/wiki/Zionism.html" title="Zionism">Zionism</a> as examples of positive nationalism.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Negative nationalism">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Negative_nationalism" id="Negative_nationalism"></a></p>
<h4>Negative nationalism</h4>
<p>This is apparent in the novel, in the Oceanians’ undying hatred for Goldstein, whose continued existence is doubtful. Orwell lists <a href="/wiki/Stalinism.html" title="Stalinism">Stalinism</a>, <a href="/wiki/Anti-Semitism.html" title="Anti-Semitism">Anti-Semitism</a> and <a href="/wiki/Anglophobia.html" title="Anglophobia">Anglophobia</a> as examples of negative nationalism.</p>

<p><a name="Transferred_nationalism" id="Transferred_nationalism"></a></p>
<h4>Transferred nationalism</h4>
<p>In the novel, an orator, mid-sentence, alters the alleged enemy of Oceania, and the crowd instantly transfer their same feelings of hatred toward the new alleged enemy. In Notes on Nationalism, Orwell describes transferred nationalism as swiftly redirecting emotions from one power unit to another, as if not by reasoned change in opinion, but as if one’s beliefs are serving one’s loyalties, which can be altered, but with the original fanaticism intact. Orwell lists <a href="/wiki/Communism.html" title="Communism">Communism</a>, <a href="/wiki/Political_Catholicism.html" title="Political Catholicism">Political Catholicism</a>, <a href="/wiki/Pacifism.html" title="Pacifism">Pacifism</a>, Colour Feeling, and Class Feeling as examples of transferred nationalism.</p>
<p>O'Brien, in one of his most conclusive statements, describes nationalism for its own sake: “The object of power is power; The object of torture is torture.”</p>

<p><a name="Sexual_repression" id="Sexual_repression"></a></p>
<h3>Sexual repression</h3>
<p>In the novel, Julia describes party fanaticism as "sex gone sour;" Winston, aside from during his affair with Julia, suffers from an ankle inflammation, alluding to <a href="/wiki/Oedipus_the_King.html" title="Oedipus the King">Oedipus Rex</a> and symbolizing an unhealthy repression of the sex drive. Orwell supposed that the sufficient mental energy for prolonged worship requires the repression of a vital instinct, such as the sex instinct. This possibly alludes to the restrictions on sexuality imposed by authorities (civil, political, religious or otherwise, such as in the German <a href="/wiki/National-socialist.html" title="National-socialist">National-socialist</a> regime), be it consciously or by selective pressures on doctrine.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Futurology">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Futurology" id="Futurology"></a></p>
<h3>Futurology</h3>
<p>It is not clear to what extent Orwell believed his work was prophetic.</p>
<p>He describes what he believed was the future of <a href="/wiki/England.html" title="England">England</a> in his essay <a href="/wiki/England%2C_Your_England.html" title="England, Your England">England, Your England</a>:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"The intellectuals who hope to see it Russianised or Germanised will be disappointed. The gentleness, the hypocrisy, the thoughtlessness, the reverence for law and the hatred of uniforms will remain, along with the suet puddings and the misty skies. It needs some very great disaster, such as prolonged subjugation by a foreign enemy, to destroy a national culture. The Stock Exchange will be pulled down, the horse plough will give way to the tractor, the country houses will be turned into children's holiday camps, the Eton and Harrow match will be forgotten, but England will still be England, an everlasting animal stretching into the future and the past, and, like all living things, having the power to change out of recognition and yet remain the same."</dd>
</dl>
<p>This is in stark contrast to O'Brien's forecast:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"There will be no curiosity, no enjoyment of the process of life. All competing pleasures will be destroyed. But always — do not forget this, Winston — always there will be the intoxication of power, constantly increasing and constantly growing subtler. Always, at every moment, there will be the thrill of victory, the sensation of trampling on an enemy who is helpless. If you want a picture of the future, imagine a boot stamping on a human face ...for ever."</dd>

<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Appendix on Newspeak">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Appendix_on_Newspeak" id="Appendix_on_Newspeak"></a></p>
<h2>Appendix on Newspeak</h2>
<dl>
<dd><i>Further information: <a href="/wiki/Newspeak.html" title="Newspeak">Newspeak</a></i></dd>
</dl>
<p>The novel includes an appendix, <i>The Principles of Newspeak</i> <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.eng.buffalo.edu/~smf7/175/chapp.html">[2]</a>, written in the style of an academic essay. The appendix describes the development of <i>Newspeak</i>, and explains how the language is designed to standardise thought to reflect the ideology of <i>Ingsoc</i>; that is, by making "all other modes of thought impossible".</p>
<p>The fact that the appendix is written in the past tense, as well as other grammatical and non-grammatical features, has led some to argue that it can be seen to be describing Newspeak, and by extension Ingsoc, as a thing of the past, possibly implying a more ambiguous ending for the novel than is commonly thought (Atwood <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://books.guardian.co.uk/departments/generalfiction/story/0,6000,978474,00.html">[3]</a>, Benstead <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.netcharles.com/orwell/articles/col-hopebegins.htm">[4]</a>). However, there is no explicit statement in the appendix to suggest that it existed or was written in the world of <i>Nineteen Eighty-Four</i>, and it could simply be a part of the third person narrative that is deployed throughout the rest of the novel.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it could be argued that Orwell, as an advocate of <a href="/wiki/Plain_English.html" title="Plain English">plain English</a>, would be unlikely to underpin such a significant plot detail with such a subtle clue.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Cultural impact">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Cultural_impact" id="Cultural_impact"></a></p>
<h2>Cultural impact</h2>
<p><i>Nineteen Eighty-Four</i> has had a surprisingly large impact on the English language. Many of its concepts, Big Brother, Room 101, thought police, doublethink and Newspeak, have entered common usage in describing totalitarian or overarching behaviour by authority. <a href="/wiki/Doublespeak.html" title="Doublespeak">Doublespeak</a> or <a href="/wiki/Doubletalk.html" title="Doubletalk">doubletalk</a> is a subsequent elaboration on the word doublethink that never actually appeared in the novel itself. The adjective "Orwellian" is often used to describe any real world scenario reminiscent of the novel. The practice of suffixing words with "-speak" and "-think" (<a href="/wiki/Groupthink.html" title="Groupthink">groupthink</a>, mediaspeak) as well as the abbreviation of "luv" for love arguably originated with the novel.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Controversy">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Controversy" id="Controversy"></a></p>
<h2>Controversy</h2>
<p>In 1981, <a href="/wiki/Jackson_County%2C_Florida.html" title="Jackson County, Florida">Jackson County</a> in the <a href="/wiki/U.S._state.html" title="U.S. state">U.S. state</a> of <a href="/wiki/Florida.html" title="Florida">Florida</a> challenged the novel on the grounds that the book was "pro-communist and contained explicit sexual matter." <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://title.forbiddenlibrary.com/">[5]</a> Supporters of the book have called this accusation preposterous, saying it casts more light on the accusers than the book.</p>
<p>The book's proponents admit that there are some passages relating to sex, and some to torture, but they are by no means extreme for the time, and are quite germane to the plot. Still, some people have objected to the book for those depictions.</p>
<p>Another criticism that can be levelled is that of anti-semitism. Goldstein, who is described as having "a Jewish face", is held up as "the Enemy of the People" by the Party, and is the subject of the Two Minutes Hate. However, it can be argued that since the Party is seen throughout the book as evil, making its main opponent Jewish cannot be seen as an anti-Semitic attitude on the part of Orwell (and could even be seen, on the contrary, as reflecting Orwell's admiration of Jews). In fact, the Soviet Union was anti-Semitic in some ways, and the Goldstein character may reflect this. In addition, some aspects of <i>Nineteen Eighty-Four</i> seem modelled after <a href="/wiki/Nazi_Germany.html" title="Nazi Germany">Nazi Germany</a>. It should also be noted that in a number of times in the book it was stated that (especally in what was the United States) "Jews, Negroes and South Americans of pure Indian blood" were "found in the highest ranks of the Party".</p>
