<p>The January, 1986, overthrow of President <a href="/wiki/Tito_Okello.html" title="Tito Okello">Tito Okello</a>, an ethnic <a href="/wiki/Acholi_people.html" title="Acholi people">Acholi</a>, by the <a href="/wiki/National_Resistance_Army.html" title="National Resistance Army">National Resistance Army</a> (NRA) of southwest Ugandan <a href="/wiki/Yoweri_Museveni.html" title="Yoweri Museveni">Yoweri Museveni</a> marked a period of intense turmoil. The Acholi feared the loss of their traditional dominance of the national military; they were also deeply concerned that the NRA would seek retribution for the brutal <a href="/wiki/Counterinsurgency.html" title="Counterinsurgency">counterinsurgency</a>, particularly the actions of the army in the <a href="/wiki/Luwero_triangle.html" title="Luwero triangle">Luwero triangle</a>.<sup id="_ref-Luwerotriangle_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[2]</a></sup> By August of that year, a full-blown popular insurgency had developed in northern regions that were occupied by government forces.</p>

Areas affected by the LRA insurgency post-2002</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>In January 1987 <a href="/wiki/Joseph_Kony.html" title="Joseph Kony">Joseph Kony</a> made his first appearance as a spirit medium, one of many who emerged after the initial success of the <a href="/wiki/Holy_Spirit_Movement.html" title="Holy Spirit Movement">Holy Spirit Movement</a> of <a href="/wiki/Alice_Auma.html" title="Alice Auma">Alice Auma</a>. Former <a href="/wiki/Uganda_People%27s_Democratic_Army.html" title="Uganda People's Democratic Army">Uganda People's Democratic Army</a> commander <a href="/wiki/Odong_Latek.html" title="Odong Latek">Odong Latek</a> convinced Kony to adopt conventional <a href="/wiki/Guerrilla_warfare.html" title="Guerrilla warfare">guerrilla tactics</a>, primarily surprise attacks on civilian targets, such as villages. The LRA also occasionally carried out large-scale attacks to underline the inability of the government to protect the populace. Until 1991 the LRA raided the populace for supplies, which were carried away by villagers who were abducted for short periods. The fact that some NRA units were known for their brutal actions ensured that the LRA were given at least passive support by segments of the Acholi population<sup id="_ref-O.E2.80.99Kadameri_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>March 1991 saw the start of "Operation North", which combined efforts to destroy the LRA while cutting away its roots of support among the population through heavy-handed tactics.<sup id="_ref-Operation_North_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[4]</a></sup> As part of Operation North, <a href="/wiki/Acholi_people.html" title="Acholi people">Acholi</a> <a href="/wiki/Betty_Oyella_Bigombe.html" title="Betty Oyella Bigombe">Betty Oyella Bigombe</a>, the Minister charged with ending the insurgency, created "Arrow Groups" mostly armed with bows and arrows, as a form of local defence. As the LRA was armed with modern weaponry, the bow-and-arrow groups were overpowered. Nevertheless, the creation of the Arrow Groups angered Kony, who began to feel that he no longer had the support of the population. In response the LRA mutilated numerous Acholi who they believed to be government supporters. While the government efforts were a failure, the LRA reaction caused many Acholi to finally turn against the insurgency. However, this was tempered by the deep-seated antagonism towards the occupying government forces.</p>
<p>After the failure of Operation North, Minister Bigombe initiated the first face-to-face meeting between representatives of the LRA and government. The LRA asked for a general amnesty for their combatants and stated that they would not surrender, but were willing to "return home." However, the government stance was hampered by disagreement over the credibility of the LRA negotiatiors and political infighting. In particular, the military had learned that Kony was negotiating with the <a href="/wiki/Sudan.html" title="Sudan">Sudanese</a> government for support while talking to Bigombe, and felt that Kony was simply trying to buy time. At a second meeting on <a href="/wiki/January_10.html" title="January 10">10 January</a> <a href="/wiki/1994.html" title="1994">1994</a>, Kony asked for six months to regroup his troops. By early February the tone of the negotiations was growing increasingly acrimonious, and following a meeting on <a href="/wiki/February_2.html" title="February 2">2 February</a>, the LRA broke off negotiations stating that they felt that the NRA was trying to entrap them. Four days later, President <a href="/wiki/Yoweri_Museveni.html" title="Yoweri Museveni">Yoweri Museveni</a> announced a seven-day deadline for the LRA to surrender.<sup id="_ref-O.E2.80.99Kadameri_1" class="reference"><a  title="">[3]</a></sup> This ultimatum ended the Bigombe initiative.</p>

<p>Two weeks after <a href="/wiki/Yoweri_Museveni.html" title="Yoweri Museveni">Museveni</a> delivered his ultimatum of <a href="/wiki/February_6.html" title="February 6">6 February</a> <a href="/wiki/1994.html" title="1994">1994</a>, LRA fighters were reported to have crossed the northern border and established bases in southern Sudan with the approval of the <a href="/wiki/Khartoum.html" title="Khartoum">Khartoum</a> government.<sup id="_ref-O.E2.80.99Kadameri_2" class="reference"><a  title="">[3]</a></sup> Sudanese aid was a response to Ugandan support for the rebel <a href="/wiki/Sudan_People%27s_Liberation_Army.html" title="Sudan People's Liberation Army">Sudan People's Liberation Army</a> (SPLA) fighting in the <a href="/wiki/Second_Sudanese_Civil_War.html" title="Second Sudanese Civil War">civil war</a> in the south of the country. Also, having become convinced that the Acholi were now collaborating with the Museveni government, Kony began to target the civilians using his increased military strength. Mutilations became commonplace, and 1994 saw the first mass forced abduction of children and young people. As most of the LRA combatants are abducted children, a military solution is widely seen by the Acholi as a massacre of victims. Government attempts to destroy the rebels are thus viewed as another cause for grievance by the Acholi. The moral ambiguity of this situation, in which abducted young rebels are both the victims and perpetrators of brutal acts, is vital in understanding the current conflict.</p>
<p>The creation of government "protected villages" beginning in 1996 further deepened the antagonistic attitude that many Acholi have toward the government, especially as the population continues to be attacked by the LRA even within the "protected camps." The camps are also crowded, unsanitary, and miserable places to live.<sup id="_ref-miserable_camps_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[5]</a></sup> Meanwhile, in 1997 the Sudanese government of the <a href="/wiki/National_Islamic_Front.html" title="National Islamic Front">National Islamic Front</a> had begun to back away from its previous hard-line stance. Following the <a href="/wiki/September_11%2C_2001_attacks.html" title="September 11, 2001 attacks">September 11, 2001 attacks</a> in the U.S., the relationship between Sudan and Uganda abruptly changed. Cross-border tensions eased as support to proxy forces fell. Some of the hundreds of thousands of civilians <a href="/wiki/Internally_displaced_person.html" title="Internally displaced person">displaced</a> by the war began to return to their homes. The number of people displaced by the conflict declined to about half a million, and people began to talk openly of the day when the "protected camps" would be disbanded.<sup id="_ref-Weeks_36_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[6]</a></sup></p>

<p>In March 2002, the <a href="/wiki/UPDF.html" title="UPDF">UPDF</a> launched a massive military offensive, named "Operation Iron Fist", against the LRA bases in southern Sudan with agreement from the <a href="/wiki/National_Islamic_Front.html" title="National Islamic Front">National Islamic Front</a>. This agreement, coupled with the return of Ugandan forces that had been deployed in the <a href="/wiki/Democratic_Republic_of_Congo.html" title="Democratic Republic of Congo">Democratic Republic of Congo</a> upon the official end of the <a href="/wiki/Second_Congo_War.html" title="Second Congo War">Second Congo War</a>, created what the Ugandan government felt was an ideal situation in which to end a conflict that had become both an embarrassment and political liability.<sup id="_ref-not_rapid_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[7]</a></sup> After several months of uncertainty, LRA forces began crossing back into Uganda and carrying out attacks on a scale and of a brutality not seen since 1995 to 1996, resulting in widespread displacement and suffering in regions that had never previously been touched by the insurgency.<sup id="_ref-RLP_30_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>A series of diplomatic initiatives during these years failed, especially as the exact negotiating position of Kony remained uncertain, but the conflict gained unprecedented international coverage. During a November 2003 field visit to Uganda, <a href="/wiki/United_Nations.html" title="United Nations">United Nations</a> <a href="/wiki/Undersecretary-General_for_Humanitarian_Affairs_and_Emergency_Relief_Coordinator.html" title="Undersecretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator">Undersecretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator</a> <a href="/wiki/Jan_Egeland.html" title="Jan Egeland">Jan Egeland</a> stated, "I cannot find any other part of the world that is having an emergency on the scale of Uganda, that is getting such little international attention."<sup id="_ref-BBC_worse_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[9]</a></sup> In December 2003, Ugandan President Museveni referred the LRA to the <a href="/wiki/International_Criminal_Court.html" title="International Criminal Court">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) to determine if the LRA is guilty of international war crimes.</p>
<p>From the middle of 2004 on, rebel activity dropped markedly under intense military pressure. The government was also the target of increasingly pointed criticism from the international community for its failure to end the conflict. International aid agencies have questioned the Ugandan government's reliance on military force and its commitment to a peaceful resolution. The army also admitted that it had recruited child soldiers who had escaped the LRA into the military.<sup id="_ref-recruiting_children_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p>In mid-September 2005, a band of LRA fighters, led by <a href="/wiki/Vincent_Otti.html" title="Vincent Otti">Vincent Otti</a>, crossed into the <a href="/wiki/Democratic_Republic_of_the_Congo.html" title="Democratic Republic of the Congo">Democratic Republic of the Congo</a> (DRC) for the first time. President Museveni declared that, if Congolese authorities did not disarm the LRA combatants, the UPDF would be sent across the border in pursuit.<sup id="_ref-congo_militia_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[11]</a></sup> This sparked a diplomatic row between the governments of the DRC and Uganda, with both militaries making a show of force along their border, while the Congolese ambassador to the United Nations sent a letter to the <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_Secretary-General.html" title="United Nations Secretary-General">UN Secretary-General</a> demanding that an economic embargo be placed on Uganda in retaliation.</p>

<p>While many abductees are taken to carry items looted from raided villages, some are also used as <a href="/wiki/Military_use_of_children.html" title="Military use of children">soldiers</a> and <a href="/wiki/Sexual_slavery.html" title="Sexual slavery">sex slaves</a>. The group performs abductions primarily from the <a href="/wiki/Acholi_people.html" title="Acholi people">Acholi people</a>, who have borne the brunt of the 18 year LRA campaign. The United Nations estimated in the mid-2000s that around 25,000 children have been kidnapped by the LRA since 1987. A 2006 survey of 750 youth in Kitgum and Pader concluded that the UN estimate was a significant underestimate. According to the survey, at least 66,000 youth between the ages of 13 and 30 have been abducted. One-third of all boys and one-sixth of all girls had been taken for at least one day. Of these, 66% of males were taken for longer than two weeks, while the equivalent number for females was 46%. If a female was gone for more than two weeks, there was a one in four chance that she had not returned. Males were again found to be taken for longer periods of time on average, with two in five males that were abducted for more than two weeks not having returned. The number of abductions was greatest in 2002 and 2003, perhaps in retaliation for Operation Iron Fist. However, the average age of abductees has risen from about 13 in 1994 to nearly 18 in 2004, coinciding with the rise in number, and fall in length, of abductions.<sup id="_ref-SWAY1_1" class="reference"><a  title="">[13]</a></sup></p>
<p>While the LRA now appears to consist of less than two thousand combatants that are under intense pressure from the Ugandan military, the government has been unable to end the insurgency so far. Ongoing peace negotiations have been complicated by an investigation by the <a href="/wiki/International_Criminal_Court.html" title="International Criminal Court">International Criminal Court</a>. The conflict continues to retard Uganda's development efforts, costing the poor country's economy a cumulative total of at least $1.33 billion, which is equivalent to 3% of GDP, or $100 million annually.<sup id="_ref-cost_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[14]</a></sup></p>

<h2>Prominent incidents</h2>
<p>Attacks, raids and abductions by the Lord's Resistance Army are a commonplace occurrence in northern Uganda, and are rarely reported outside the country. During periods of heightened activity, such as 1996 to 1997 and 2002 to 2004, murders and abductions are reported almost daily. While it would be impractical to list every such attack (and it is unlikely that every incident has been documented), the following is a partial list of incidents that are exceptional either because of the large number of victims, the identity of the victims, or the circumstances of the incident.</p>

<h3>Juba peace talks</h3>
<p>A delegation from the LRA arrived in <a href="/wiki/Juba%2C_Sudan.html" title="Juba, Sudan">Juba, Sudan</a> on <a href="/wiki/June_8.html" title="June 8">8 June</a> <a href="/wiki/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> to prepare for talks with the Ugandan government, to be mediated by the <a href="/wiki/Government_of_Southern_Sudan.html" title="Government of Southern Sudan">Government of Southern Sudan</a> <sup id="_ref-juba_8_june_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[21]</a></sup> and by the <a href="/wiki/Community_of_Sant%27Egidio.html" title="Community of Sant'Egidio">Community of Sant'Egidio</a> <sup id="_ref-Sant.27Egidio_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[22]</a></sup>.These talks were agreed to after Kony released a video in May in which he denied committing atrocities and seemed to call for an end to hostilities, in response to an announcement by Museveni that he would guarantee the safety of Kony if peace was agreed to by July. Museveni had pledged to grant Kony total amnesty if he gave up "terrorism". Uganda's security minister <a href="/wiki/Amama_Mbabazi.html" title="Amama Mbabazi">Amama Mbabazi</a> urged the ICC to drop war crimes indictments against leaders of the LRA, but LRA's legal adviser Krispus <a  class="new" title="Ayena Odongo">Ayena Odongo</a> rejected the offer, saying that accepting amnesty "presupposes surrender" and would mean the LRA was no longer available for discussions.<sup id="_ref-amnesty_rejection_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[23]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-drop_charges_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[24]</a></sup> Several organisations, including the ICC<sup id="_ref-amnesty_offer_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[25]</a></sup> and the <a href="/wiki/International_Bar_Association.html" title="International Bar Association">International Bar Association</a>'s Human Rights Institute<sup id="_ref-IBA_rejects_amnesty_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[26]</a></sup> insisted that LRA leaders must be arrested in accordance with the <a href="/wiki/Rome_Statute_of_the_International_Criminal_Court.html" title="Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court">Rome Statute</a>.</p>
<p>In late June 2006, the Government of Southern Sudan formally invited Uganda to attend peace talks <sup id="_ref-sudan_invitation_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[27]</a></sup>, and on <a href="/wiki/July_14.html" title="July 14">July 14</a>, <a href="/wiki/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> talks began in Juba between delegations from the LRA and Uganda, with the Vice-president of Southern Sudan <a href="/wiki/Riek_Machar.html" title="Riek Machar">Riek Machar</a> as the chief mediator. The leader of the Ugandan delegation, Internal Affairs Minister <a href="/wiki/Ruhakana_Rugunda.html" title="Ruhakana Rugunda">Ruhakana Rugunda</a> stated that his priority was to obtain a quick ceasefire.<sup id="_ref-Rugunda_comment_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[28]</a></sup> The LRA delegation, led by <a  class="new" title="Martin Ojul">Martin Ojul</a>, said that LRA's acceptance of the peace talks should not be interpreted that LRA can no longer fight, but stressed that a negotiated settlement is the best way to end the conflict.<sup id="_ref-Ojul_speech_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[29]</a></sup></p>
<p>The initial delegation was criticized as largely consisting of expatriate Acholi, rather than members of the fighting force. However, after many delays <a href="/wiki/Vincent_Otti.html" title="Vincent Otti">Vincent Otti</a> arrived for meetings on the 29th,<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a  title="">[30]</a></sup> followed the next day by Kony's 14-year old son <a  class="new" title="Salim Saleh Kony">Salim Saleh Kony</a> (sharing a name with brother of President Museveni, <a href="/wiki/Salim_Saleh.html" title="Salim Saleh">Salim Saleh</a>).<sup id="_ref-BBC_meet_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[31]</a></sup> Kony himself met with local religious and political leaders from northern Uganda and southern Sudan on the following day.<sup id="_ref-BBC_meet_1" class="reference"><a  title="">[31]</a></sup> On <a href="/wiki/August_2.html" title="August 2">2 August</a>, Kony held his first ever press conference in which he demanded a ceasefire before LRA-government negotiations resume on the 7th and denied ever abducting children. Some media sources noted that, of the approximately 80 LRA fighters surrounding the press venue, several appeared to be in their early teens.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a  title="">[32]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a  title="">[33]</a></sup></p>
<p>The broader context of the talks remained confused. The government of Southern Sudan views the talks as a means of ridding itself of a foreign army that is complicating their delicate relationship with the Khartoum government. The request by the Ugandan Government for ICC to suspend war crimes indictments against leaders of the LRA, condemned by international human rights groups but largely supported by leaders and civilians within northern Uganda, led some political analysts to see Ugandan Government's request as a ploy to gain local support. The comment of a George Olara, an <a href="/wiki/Internally_displaced_person.html" title="Internally displaced person">IDP</a> living in a camp in <a href="/wiki/Pader_District.html" title="Pader District">Pader</a>, was fairly typical: "He [Kony] should not be taken to <a href="/wiki/The_Hague.html" title="The Hague">The Hague</a>. Let him come back and live with the community because this is how reconciliation will be achieved. ... <a href="/wiki/Peace.html" title="Peace">Peace</a> will come if the talks succeed, but there is the potential that they may also fail like they have done before".<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a  title="">[34]</a></sup></p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/August_4.html" title="August 4">4 August</a> <a href="/wiki/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>, Vincent Otti declared a unilateral ceasefire and asked the Ugandan government to reciprocate. Ugandan Internal Affairs Minister <a href="/wiki/Ruhakana_Rugunda.html" title="Ruhakana Rugunda">Ruhakana Rugunda</a> stated that they were waiting to see the effect on the ground.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a  title="">[35]</a></sup> ICC indictee Raska Lukwiya was killed in battle on <a href="/wiki/August_12.html" title="August 12">12 August</a> <a href="/wiki/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>; the LRA asked for three days of mourning though a spokesman said that talks would continue.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a  title="">[36]</a></sup> Ugandan President Museveni has set a <a href="/wiki/September_12.html" title="September 12">12 September</a> <a href="/wiki/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> deadline to finalize a peace deal.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a  title="">[37]</a></sup> The government and LRA signed a truce on <a href="/wiki/August_26.html" title="August 26">26 August</a> <a href="/wiki/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>. Under the terms of the agreement, LRA forces will leave Uganda and gather in two assembly areas, where the Ugandan government has promised they will not attack and the government of Southern Sudan will guarantee their safety. Once this is accomplished, talks on a comprehensive peace agreement will begin, though Museveni's <a href="/wiki/September_12.html" title="September 12">12 September</a> deadline appears to still be in effect.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a  title="">[38]</a></sup></p>
