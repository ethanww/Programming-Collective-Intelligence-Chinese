<p>The term <i><b>Celt</b></i>, normally pronounced /<span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">k…õlt</span>/ (see <a href="/wiki/Celt#The_term_in_English.html" title="Celt">below</a>), refers to a member of any of a number of peoples in Europe using the <a href="/wiki/Celtic_languages.html" title="Celtic languages">Celtic languages</a>, which form a branch of <a href="/wiki/Indo-European_languages.html" title="Indo-European languages">Indo-European languages</a>, as well as others whose language is unknown but where associated cultural traits such as <a href="/wiki/Celtic_art.html" title="Celtic art">Celtic art</a> are found in <a href="/wiki/Archaeological.html" title="Archaeological">archaeological</a> evidence. Historical theories were developed that these factors were indicative of a common origin, but later theories of culture spreading to differing indigenous peoples have recently been supported by some genetic studies.</p>
<p>Though the spread of the <a href="/wiki/Roman_empire.html" title="Roman empire">Roman empire</a> led to continental Celts adopting <a href="/wiki/Roman_culture.html" title="Roman culture">Roman culture</a>, the development of <a href="/wiki/Celtic_Christianity.html" title="Celtic Christianity">Celtic Christianity</a> in <a href="/wiki/Ireland.html" title="Ireland">Ireland</a> and <a href="/wiki/Great_Britain.html" title="Great Britain">Britain</a> brought an early <a href="/wiki/Medieval.html" title="Medieval">medieval</a> renaissance of Celtic art between <a href="/wiki/400.html" title="400">400</a> and <a href="/wiki/1200.html" title="1200">1200</a>. <a href="/wiki/Antiquarian.html" title="Antiquarian">Antiquarian</a> interest from the <a href="/wiki/17th_century.html" title="17th century">17th century</a> led to the term <b>Celt</b> being extended, and rising <a href="/wiki/Nationalism.html" title="Nationalism">nationalism</a> brought Celtic revivals from the <a href="/wiki/19th_century.html" title="19th century">19th century</a> in areas where the use of Celtic languages had continued.</p>
<p>Today, <b>"Celtic"</b> is often used to describe the languages and respective cultures of <b><a href="/wiki/Ireland.html" title="Ireland">Ireland</a></b>, <b><a href="/wiki/Scotland.html" title="Scotland">Scotland</a></b>, <b><a href="/wiki/Wales.html" title="Wales">Wales</a></b>, <b><a href="/wiki/Cornwall.html" title="Cornwall">Cornwall</a></b>, the <b><a href="/wiki/Isle_of_Man.html" title="Isle of Man">Isle of Man</a></b> and <b><a href="/wiki/Brittany.html" title="Brittany">Brittany</a></b> (see the <i><a href="/wiki/Modern_Celts.html" title="Modern Celts">Modern Celts</a></i> article), but corresponds more accurately to the <a href="/wiki/Celtic_language.html" title="Celtic language">Celtic language</a> family - of which six languages are spoken today (Manx and Cornish being recent revivals): <a href="/wiki/Irish_language.html" title="Irish language">Irish</a>, <a href="/wiki/Scottish_Gaelic_language.html" title="Scottish Gaelic language">Scottish Gaelic</a> and <a href="/wiki/Manx_language.html" title="Manx language">Manx</a> (<a href="/wiki/Goidelic_languages.html" title="Goidelic languages">Goidelic languages</a>) and <a href="/wiki/Welsh_people.html" title="Welsh people">Welsh</a>, <a href="/wiki/Breton_language.html" title="Breton language">Breton</a> and <a href="/wiki/Cornish_language.html" title="Cornish language">Cornish</a> (<a href="/wiki/Brythonic_language.html" title="Brythonic language">Brythonic languages</a>).</p>
<p>Only in the last two decades of the twentieth century did multidisciplinary studies come to bear upon the history of the Celts. Disciplines such as ancient history, palaeolinguistics, archaeology, history of art, anthropology, population genetics, history of religion, ethnology, mythology and folklore studies must all be taken into consideration and their findings compared one with another, without falling into the fallacies of what John Collis (2003) has termed the "continuous circular argument" (Lorrio and Zapatero).</p>

<h2>Development of the term "Celt"</h2>
<p>The first literary reference to the Celtic people, as <i>keltoi</i> is by the <a href="/wiki/Greece.html" title="Greece">Greek</a> <a href="/wiki/Historian.html" title="Historian">historian</a> <a href="/wiki/Hecataeus.html" title="Hecataeus">Hecataeus</a> in <a href="/wiki/517_BC.html" title="517 BC">517 BC</a>. He locates the <i>Keltoi</i> tribe in Rhenania (West/Southwest Germany). According to <a href="/wiki/Greek_mythology.html" title="Greek mythology">Greek mythology</a>, <i><a href="/wiki/Celtus.html" title="Celtus">Celtus</a></i> was the son of <a href="/wiki/Heracles.html" title="Heracles">Heracles</a> and <i><a href="/wiki/Keltine.html" title="Keltine">Keltine</a></i>, the daughter of <i><a  class="new" title="Bretannus">Bretannus</a></i>. Celtus became the primogenitor of Celts <sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a  title="">[1]</a></sup>. In Latin <i>Celta</i> came in turn from <a href="/wiki/Herodotus.html" title="Herodotus">Herodotus</a>' word for the Gauls, <i>Keltoi</i>. The Romans used <i>Celtae</i> to refer to continental Gauls, but apparently not to <a  class="new" title="Insular Celts">Insular Celts</a>, which were divided into <a href="/wiki/Goidelic.html" title="Goidelic">Goidhels</a> and <a href="/wiki/Britons.html" title="Britons">Britons</a>, and possibly other peoples.</p>

<p><a name="The_term_in_English" id="The_term_in_English"></a></p>
<h3>The term in English</h3>
<p>The English word is modern, attested from <a href="/wiki/1707.html" title="1707">1707</a> in the writings of <a href="/wiki/Edward_Lhuyd.html" title="Edward Lhuyd">Edward Lhuyd</a> whose work, along with that of other late <a href="/wiki/17th_century.html" title="17th century">17th century</a> scholars, brought academic attention to the languages and history of the original inhabitants of Great Britain.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a  title="">[2]</a></sup> In the <a href="/wiki/18th_century.html" title="18th century">18th century</a> the interest in "<a href="/wiki/Primitivism.html" title="Primitivism">primitivism</a>" which led to the idea of the "<a href="/wiki/Noble_savage.html" title="Noble savage">noble savage</a>" brought a wave of enthusiasm for all things "Celtic". The antiquarian <a href="/wiki/William_Stukeley.html" title="William Stukeley">William Stukeley</a> pictured a race of "Ancient Britons" putting up the "Temples of the Ancient Celts" such as <a href="/wiki/Stonehenge.html" title="Stonehenge">Stonehenge</a> before he decided in 1733 to recast the Celts in his book as <a href="/wiki/Druid.html" title="Druid">Druids</a>. The <a href="/wiki/Ossian.html" title="Ossian">Ossian</a> fables written by <a href="/wiki/James_Macpherson.html" title="James Macpherson">James Macpherson</a> and portrayed as ancient <a href="/wiki/Scottish_Gaelic_language.html" title="Scottish Gaelic language">Scottish Gaelic language</a> poems added to this romantic enthusiasm. The "Irish revival" came after the <a href="/wiki/Catholic_Emancipation.html" title="Catholic Emancipation">Catholic Emancipation</a> Act of 1829 as a conscious attempt to demonstrate an Irish national identity, and with its counterpart in other countries subsequently became the "Celtic revival". <sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a  title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>Nowadays "Celt" and "Celtic" are usually pronounced <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/k…õlt/</span> and <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/k…õlt…™k/</span> (see <a href="/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet.html" title="International Phonetic Alphabet">IPA</a>) when referring to the ethnic group and its languages. The pronunciation <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/'s…õlt…™k/</span> is occasionally used in this context, but is mainly restricted to the names of certain sports teams (eg. the <a href="/wiki/National_Basketball_Association.html" title="National Basketball Association">NBA</a> team, <a href="/wiki/Boston_Celtics.html" title="Boston Celtics">Boston Celtics</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/Scottish_Premier_League.html" title="Scottish Premier League">SPL</a> side, <a href="/wiki/Celtic_F.C..html" title="Celtic F.C.">Celtic F.C.</a>, in <a href="/wiki/Glasgow.html" title="Glasgow">Glasgow</a>).<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a  title="">[4]</a></sup></p>

<p><a name="Modern_uses" id="Modern_uses"></a></p>
<h3>Modern uses</h3>
<p>In a historical context, the terms "Celt" and "Celtic" can be used in several senses: they can denote peoples speaking Celtic languages; the peoples of <a href="/wiki/Prehistoric.html" title="Prehistoric">prehistoric</a> and early historic Europe who shared common cultural traits which are thought to have originated in the <a href="/wiki/Hallstatt_culture.html" title="Hallstatt culture">Hallstatt</a> and <a href="/wiki/La_T%C3%A8ne_culture.html" title="La T√®ne culture">La T√®ne cultures</a>; or the peoples known to the Greeks as Keltoi, to the Romans as Celtae and to either by cognate terms such as Gallae or Galatae. The extent to which each of these meanings refers to the same group of people is a matter of considerable debate.</p>

<p>In a modern context, the term "Celt" or "Celtic" can be used to denote peoples speaking Celtic languages and descendants of such peoples. There are six modern nations typically defined as 'Celtic Nations'. To be defined as a Celtic nation, that nation must possess a Celtic language, although this need not be the language of the majority: this is in fact no longer the case in any of the six. The six nations usually considered Celtic are Brittany, Cornwall, Scotland, Ireland, the Isle of Man, and Wales.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Galicia_%28Spain%29.html" title="Galicia (Spain)">Galicia</a> is also often considered a Celtic nation. Traces of a Celtic language endure in personal and place names, while <a href="/wiki/Asturias.html" title="Asturias">Asturias</a> is sometimes considered to be a modern Celtic nation based on the survival of Celtic traditions similar to the traditions of other Celtic nations; however, no Celtic language has survived in either. <a href="/wiki/England.html" title="England">England</a> likewise retains some Celtic influences yet hasn't retained a Celtic language (even Cornwall became fully English-speaking during the 18th century) and is thus not categorised as a Celtic nation. <a href="/wiki/Cornish_language.html" title="Cornish language">Cornish</a> aside, the last attested Celtic language native to England was <a href="/wiki/Cumbric_language.html" title="Cumbric language">Cumbric</a>, spoken in Cumbria and southern Scotland and which may have survived until the <a href="/wiki/13th_century.html" title="13th century">13th century</a>, but was most likely dead by the <a href="/wiki/11th_century.html" title="11th century">eleventh</a>. As in the case of Cornish, there have been recent attempts to revive it, although the evidence upon which this is based is slight in the extreme. Another area of Europe associated with the Celts is <a href="/wiki/France.html" title="France">France</a>, which traces its roots to the <a href="/wiki/Gauls.html" title="Gauls">Gauls</a>. In Scotland, the <a href="/wiki/Scottish_Gaelic_language.html" title="Scottish Gaelic language">Gaelic language</a> traces at least some of its roots to <a href="/wiki/Migration.html" title="Migration">migration</a> and settlement by the Irish <a href="/wiki/D%C3%A1l_Riata.html" title="D√°l Riata">D√°l Riata</a>/<a href="/wiki/Scotti.html" title="Scotti">Scotti</a>. The settlement of Germanic immigrants in the lowlands &#160;‚Äî among other things&#160;‚Äî reduced the spread of the Gaelic language which was supplanting Brythonic in Scotland; this has meant that Scots-Gaelic-speaking communities survive chiefly in the country's northern and western fringes in the area that comprised the Scot kingdom of D√°l Riata.</p>

<h3>"Celts" in Britain</h3>
<p>The use of the word 'Celtic' as a valid <a href="/wiki/Umbrella_term.html" title="Umbrella term">umbrella term</a> for the pre-Roman peoples of <a href="/wiki/Britain.html" title="Britain">Britain</a> has been challenged by many writers ‚Äî including <a  class="new" title="Dr Simon James (archaeologist)">Simon James</a>, formerly of the <a href="/wiki/British_Museum.html" title="British Museum">British Museum</a>. His book <i><a  class="new" title="The Atlantic Celts - Ancient People Or Modern Invention?">The Atlantic Celts - Ancient People Or Modern Invention?</a></i> makes the point that the <a href="/wiki/Ancient_Rome.html" title="Ancient Rome">Romans</a> never used the term 'Celtic' in reference to the peoples of the <a href="/wiki/Atlantic_Archipelago.html" title="Atlantic Archipelago">Atlantic archipelago</a>, i.e. the <a href="/wiki/British_Isles.html" title="British Isles">British Isles</a> and <a href="/wiki/Ireland.html" title="Ireland">Ireland</a>, and points out that the modern term "Celt" was coined as a useful umbrella term in the early <a href="/wiki/18th_century.html" title="18th century">18th century</a> to distinguish the non-English inhabitants of the <a href="/wiki/Archipelago.html" title="Archipelago">archipelago</a> when <a href="/wiki/England.html" title="England">England</a> united with <a href="/wiki/Scotland.html" title="Scotland">Scotland</a> in <a href="/wiki/1707.html" title="1707">1707</a> to create the <a href="/wiki/Kingdom_of_Great_Britain.html" title="Kingdom of Great Britain">Kingdom of Great Britain</a> and the later union of <a href="/wiki/Great_Britain.html" title="Great Britain">Great Britain</a> and <a href="/wiki/Ireland.html" title="Ireland">Ireland</a> as the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom.html" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> in 1800. <a href="/wiki/Nationalists.html" title="Nationalists">Nationalists</a> in <a href="/wiki/Scotland.html" title="Scotland">Scotland</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ireland.html" title="Ireland">Ireland</a> and <a href="/wiki/Wales.html" title="Wales">Wales</a> looked for a way to differentiate themselves from England and assert their right to independence. James then argues that, despite the obvious linguistic connections, <a href="/wiki/Archaeology.html" title="Archaeology">archaeology</a> does not suggest a united Celtic culture and that the term is misleading, no more (or less) meaningful than 'Western European' would be today.</p>
<p>Miranda Green, author of <a  class="new" title="Celtic Goddesses">Celtic Goddesses</a>, describes archaeologists as finding "a certain homogeneity" in the traditions in the area of Celtic habitation including Britain and Ireland ‚Äî She sees the inhabitants of the British Isles and Ireland as having become thoroughly Celticized by the time of the Roman arrival, mainly through spread of culture rather than a movement of people.</p>
<p>In his book <i>Iron Age Britain</i>, <a href="/wiki/Barry_Cunliffe.html" title="Barry Cunliffe">Barry Cunliffe</a> concludes that "...there is no evidence in the British Isles to suggest that a population group of any size migrated from the continent in the first millennium BC...". Modern archaeological thought tends to disparage the idea of large population movements without facts to back them up, a caution which appears to be vindicated by some genetic studies. In other words, Celtic culture in the Atlantic Archipelago and continental Europe could have emerged through the peaceful convergence of local tribal cultures bound together by networks of <a href="/wiki/Trade.html" title="Trade">trade</a> and <a href="/wiki/Kinship.html" title="Kinship">kinship</a>&#160;‚Äî not by war and conquest. This type of peaceful <a href="/wiki/Convergence.html" title="Convergence">convergence</a> and <a href="/wiki/Cooperation.html" title="Cooperation">cooperation</a> is actually relatively common among tribal peoples; other well known examples of the phenomenon include the <a href="/wiki/Six_Nations.html" title="Six Nations">Six Nations</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Iroquois_League.html" title="Iroquois League">Iroquois League</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Nuer.html" title="Nuer">Nuer</a> of <a href="/wiki/East_Africa.html" title="East Africa">East Africa</a>. He argues that the ancient Celts are thus best depicted as a loose and highly diverse collection of indigenous tribal societies bound together by trade, a common <a href="/wiki/Druidic.html" title="Druidic">druidic</a> religion, and similar political institutions&#160;‚Äî but each having its own local language and traditions.</p>
<p>Michael Morse in the conclusion of his book <i>How the Celts came to Britain</i> concedes that the concepts of a broad Celtic linguistic area and recognizably Celtic art have their uses, but argues that the term implies a greater unity than existed. Despite such problems he suggests that the term Celt is probably too deep-rooted to be replaced and&#160;‚Äî what is more important&#160;‚Äî it has the definition that we choose to give it. The problem is that the wider public reads into the term quite <a href="/wiki/Anachronistic.html" title="Anachronistic">anachronistic</a> concepts of ethnic unity that no one on either side in the academic debate holds.</p>

<h3>Population genetics</h3>
<p>With the information gathered recently by population <a href="/wiki/Geneticist.html" title="Geneticist">geneticists</a>, it is becoming increasingly clear that the old idea of large-scale replacement by newer invaders is sometimes a misleading concept. The Celtic ethnicity debate took off at a particularly early stage in population genetic studies, a science still in its very early stages of development. Taking this into account along with the fact that these limited studies are dealing only with particular sections of DNA (eg. <a href="/wiki/MtDNA.html" title="MtDNA">MtDNA</a>, <a href="/wiki/Y_chromosome.html" title="Y chromosome">Y chromosome</a>; no studies can currently be carried out regarding <a href="/wiki/X_chromosome.html" title="X chromosome">X chromosome</a> inheritance), the results cannot be considered conclusive in any way.</p>
<p>In his book <i>Neanderthal</i>, archaeologist Douglas Palmer refers to genetic research conducted across Europe, then states the original modern genetic group in Europe arrived between 9,000 and 5,000 years ago with the spread of <a href="/wiki/Farming.html" title="Farming">farming</a>, displacing the earlier <a href="/wiki/Hunter_gatherer.html" title="Hunter gatherer">hunter gatherer</a> populations. Such displacement occurred by population explosion, since farming is capable of supporting up to 60 times greater population than the hunter-gatherer lifestyle in the same area:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>"None of Europe's subsequent historic upheavals - even catastrophic wars and <a href="/wiki/Famine.html" title="Famine">famines</a> - has seriously dented the old pattern set by the influx of farmers. The <a href="/wiki/Goths.html" title="Goths">Goths</a>, <a href="/wiki/Huns.html" title="Huns">Huns</a> and Romans have come and gone without any significant impact on the ancient gene map of Europe"</i>.</dd>
</dl>
<p>DNA analyses with both mtDNA and Y-chromosome have shown that Celts were kin to the Basques. It has been pointed by J.F. del Giorgio, in <i><a href="/wiki/The_Oldest_Europeans.html" title="The Oldest Europeans">The Oldest Europeans</a></i>, that practically the whole post-glacial European population proceeded from almost the same genetic stock, due to a genetic bottle-neck or human near extinction during the coldest episode of the Ice Age in Europe. Celts evidently maintained their isolation as much as possible, but there was an obvious addition of Indo-Europeans as shown by Celtic language and religion.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Y-chromosomes.html" title="Y-chromosomes">Y-chromosomes</a> of populations of the so called Celtic countries have been found in one study to primarily belong to <a href="/wiki/Haplogroup.html" title="Haplogroup">haplogroup</a> R1B, which makes them descendants partially of the first people to migrate into north-western Europe after the last major <a href="/wiki/Ice_age.html" title="Ice age">ice age</a>.

<p>The Celtic language family is a branch of the larger <a href="/wiki/Indo-European_languages.html" title="Indo-European languages">Indo-European family</a>, which leads some scholars to a hypothesis that the original speakers of the Celtic proto-language may have arisen in the <a href="/wiki/Black_Sea.html" title="Black Sea">Pontic</a>-<a href="/wiki/Caspian_Sea.html" title="Caspian Sea">Caspian</a> <a href="/wiki/Steppes.html" title="Steppes">steppes</a> (see <a href="/wiki/Kurgan.html" title="Kurgan">Kurgan</a>). However, speakers of Celtic languages enter history from around <a href="/wiki/600_BC.html" title="600 BC">600 BC</a>, when they were already split into several languages groups, and spread over much of Central Europe, the <a href="/wiki/Iberian_peninsula.html" title="Iberian peninsula">Iberian peninsula</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ireland.html" title="Ireland">Ireland</a> and <a href="/wiki/Britain.html" title="Britain">Britain</a>. Some studies now suggest (see <a href="/wiki/Celt#Population_Genetics.html" title="Celt">above</a>) that certain of the Celtic peoples shared genetic ancestry with the <a href="/wiki/Basque_people.html" title="Basque people">Basque people</a><sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a  title="">[5]</a></sup>. J.F. del Giorgio in <i><a href="/wiki/The_Oldest_Europeans.html" title="The Oldest Europeans">The Oldest Europeans</a></i> mentions that mythologists like <a href="/wiki/Robert_Graves.html" title="Robert Graves">Robert Graves</a> reached a similar conclusion through <a href="/wiki/Comparative_mythology.html" title="Comparative mythology">comparative mythology</a> and the study of Celtic customs.</p>
<p>Some scholars think that the <a href="/wiki/Urnfield.html" title="Urnfield">Urnfield culture</a> represents an origin for the Celts as a distinct cultural branch of the Indo-European family. This culture was preeminent in central <a href="/wiki/Europe.html" title="Europe">Europe</a> during the late <a href="/wiki/Bronze_Age.html" title="Bronze Age">Bronze Age</a>, from ca. <a href="/wiki/1200_BC.html" title="1200 BC">1200 BC</a> until <a href="/wiki/700_BC.html" title="700 BC">700 BC</a>, itself following the <a href="/wiki/Unetice_culture.html" title="Unetice culture">Unetice</a> and <a href="/wiki/Tumulus_cultures.html" title="Tumulus cultures">Tumulus</a> cultures. The Urnfield period saw a dramatic increase in population in the region, probably due to innovations in technology and agricultural practices. The spread of <a href="/wiki/Iron_Age.html" title="Iron Age">iron-working</a> led to the development of the <a href="/wiki/Hallstatt_culture.html" title="Hallstatt culture">Hallstatt culture</a> directly from the Urnfield (c. <a href="/wiki/700_BC.html" title="700 BC">700</a> to <a href="/wiki/500_BC.html" title="500 BC">500 BC</a>). <a href="/wiki/Proto-Celtic.html" title="Proto-Celtic">Proto-Celtic</a>, the latest common ancestor of all known Celtic languages, is considered by this school of thought to have been spoken at the time of the late Urnfield or early Hallstatt cultures, in the early <a href="/wiki/First_millennium_BC.html" title="First millennium BC">first millennium BC</a>.</p>
<p>The spread of the Celtic languages to Britain and to Iberia would have occurred during the first half of the 1st millennium, the earliest <a href="/wiki/Chariot_burial.html" title="Chariot burial">chariot burials</a> in Britain dating to ca. <a href="/wiki/500_BC.html" title="500 BC">500 BC</a>. Over the centuries they developed into the separate <a href="/wiki/Celtiberian_language.html" title="Celtiberian language">Celtiberian</a>, <a href="/wiki/Goidelic_languages.html" title="Goidelic languages">Goidelic</a> and <a href="/wiki/Brythonic_languages.html" title="Brythonic languages">Brythonic languages</a>. Whether Goidelic and Brythonic are descended from a common Insular-Celtic language, or if they reflect two separate waves of migration is disputed. The La T√®ne culture, in any case, can be associated with the <a href="/wiki/Gaul.html" title="Gaul">Gauls</a>, but it is entirely too late for a candidate for the Proto-Celtic culture.</p>
<p>The Hallstatt culture was succeeded by the <a href="/wiki/La_T%C3%A8ne_culture.html" title="La T√®ne culture">La T√®ne culture</a>, and during the final stages of the <a href="/wiki/Iron_Age.html" title="Iron Age">Iron Age</a> gradually transformed into the explicitly Celtic culture of early historical times. The La T√®ne culture was distributed around the upper reaches of <a href="/wiki/Danube.html" title="Danube">the Danube</a>, <a href="/wiki/Switzerland.html" title="Switzerland">Switzerland</a>, <a href="/wiki/Austria.html" title="Austria">Austria</a>, southern and central <a href="/wiki/Germany.html" title="Germany">Germany</a>, northern regions of <a href="/wiki/Italy.html" title="Italy">Italy</a>, eastern <a href="/wiki/France.html" title="France">France</a>, <a href="/wiki/Bohemia.html" title="Bohemia">Bohemia</a> and <a href="/wiki/Moravia.html" title="Moravia">Moravia</a>, and parts of <a href="/wiki/Hungary.html" title="Hungary">Hungary</a>. The technologies, decorative practices and metal-working styles of the La T√®ne were to be very influential on the continental Celts. The La T√®ne style was highly derivative from the Greek, <a href="/wiki/Etruscan.html" title="Etruscan">Etruscan</a> and <a href="/wiki/Scythian.html" title="Scythian">Scythian</a> decorative styles with whom the La T√®ne settlers frequently traded.</p>
<p>Additional forays into <a href="/wiki/Greece.html" title="Greece">Greece</a> and central <a href="/wiki/Italy.html" title="Italy">Italy</a> during the historical period did not result in settlement, though the same movement that brought Celtic invaders to Greece pushed on through to Anatolia, where they settled as the <a href="/wiki/Galatia.html" title="Galatia">Galatians</a>.</p>
<p>As there is no archaeological evidence for large scale invasions in some of the other areas, one current school of thought holds that Celtic language and culture spread to those areas by contact rather than invasion.

<h2>Celts in Ireland and Britain</h2>
<p>The indigenous populations of Britain and Ireland today may be primarily descended from the ancient peoples that have long inhabited these lands, before the coming of Celtic and later Germanic peoples, language and culture. As to the original culture and language, little is known but remnants may remain in the naming of some geographical features, such as the rivers <a href="/wiki/Clyde.html" title="Clyde">Clyde</a>, <a href="/wiki/Tamar.html" title="Tamar">Tamar</a> and <a href="/wiki/Thames.html" title="Thames">Thames</a> whose etymology is unclear but may certainly derive from a pre-Celtic <a href="/wiki/Substrate.html" title="Substrate">substrate</a>. By the Roman period, however, most of the inhabitants of the isles of <a href="/wiki/Ireland.html" title="Ireland">Ireland</a> and <a href="/wiki/Great_Britain.html" title="Great Britain">Great Britain</a> (the <i>ancient <a href="/wiki/Britons.html" title="Britons">Britons</a></i>) were speaking <a href="/wiki/Goidelic.html" title="Goidelic">Goidelic</a> or <a href="/wiki/Brythonic.html" title="Brythonic">Brythonic</a> languages, close counterparts to Gallic languages spoken on the European mainland. Historians explained this as the result of successive <a href="/wiki/Invasion.html" title="Invasion">invasions</a> from the European continent by diverse Celtic-speaking peoples over the course of several centuries. In <a href="/wiki/1946.html" title="1946">1946</a> the Celtic scholar <a href="/wiki/T._F._O%27Rahilly.html" title="T. F. O'Rahilly">T. F. O'Rahilly</a> published his extremely influential model of the <a href="/wiki/Early_history_of_Ireland.html" title="Early history of Ireland">early history of Ireland</a> which postulated four separate waves of Celtic invaders. What languages were spoken by the peoples <a href="/wiki/Ireland.html" title="Ireland">Ireland</a> and <a href="/wiki/Britain.html" title="Britain">Britain</a> before the arrival of the Celts is unknown.</p>

<p>Later research indicated that culture had developed gradually and continuously. In Ireland little archaeological evidence was found for large intrusive groups of Celtic immigrants, suggesting to historians such as <a href="/wiki/Colin_Renfrew.html" title="Colin Renfrew">Colin Renfrew</a> that the native late Bronze Age inhabitants gradually absorbed European Celtic influences and language. The very few continental <a href="/wiki/La_T%C3%A8ne_culture.html" title="La T√®ne culture">La T√®ne culture</a> style objects which had been found in Ireland could have been imports, the possessions of a few rich immigrants, or the result of selectively absorbing cultural influences from outside elites, further supporting this theory of cultural exchange rather than migration.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Julius_Caesar.html" title="Julius Caesar">Julius Caesar</a> wrote of people in Britain who came from Belgium (the <a href="/wiki/Belgae.html" title="Belgae">Belgae</a>), but archaeological evidence which was interpreted in the <a href="/wiki/1930s.html" title="1930s">1930s</a> as confirming this was contradicted by later interpretations. The archaeological evidence is of substantial cultural continuity through the first millenium BCE, although with a significant overlay of selectively-adopted elements of La T√®ne culture. There is numismatic and other evidence of continental-style states appearing in southern England close to the end of the period possibly reflecting in part immigration by √©lites from various Gallic states such as those of the Belgae. However, this immigration would be far too late to account for the origins of Insular Celtic languages. In the <a href="/wiki/1970s.html" title="1970s">1970s</a> the continuity model was taken to an extreme, popularised by <a href="/wiki/Colin_Burgess.html" title="Colin Burgess">Colin Burgess</a> in his book <i><a  class="new" title="The Age of Stonehenge">The Age of Stonehenge</a></i> which theorised that Celtic culture in Great Britain "emerged" rather than resulted from invasion and that the Celts were not invading aliens, but the descendants of the people of Stonehenge. The existence of Celtic language elsewhere in Europe, however, and the dating of the Proto-Celtic culture and language to the Bronze age, makes the most extreme claims of continuity impossible.</p>
<p>More recently a number of <a href="/wiki/Genetics.html" title="Genetics">genetic</a> studies have also supported this model of culture and language being absorbed by native populations. The study by Cristian Capelli, David Goldstein and others at <a href="/wiki/University_College%2C_London.html" title="University College, London">University College, London</a> showed that genes associated with Gaelic names in <a href="/wiki/Ireland.html" title="Ireland">Ireland</a> and <a href="/wiki/Scotland.html" title="Scotland">Scotland</a> are also common in certain parts of <a href="/wiki/Wales.html" title="Wales">Wales</a> and are similar to the genes of the <a href="/wiki/Basque_people.html" title="Basque people">Basque people</a>, who speak a non-<a href="/wiki/Indo-European_languages.html" title="Indo-European languages">Indo-European</a> language. This similarity supported earlier findings in suggesting a largely pre-Celtic genetic ancestry, possibly going back to the <a href="/wiki/Paleolithic.html" title="Paleolithic">Paleolithic</a>. They suggest that 'Celtic' culture and the Celtic language may have been imported to Britain by cultural contact, not mass invasions around <a href="/wiki/600_BC.html" title="600 BC">600 BC</a>.</p>
<p>Some recent studies have suggested that, contrary to long-standing beliefs, the Germanic tribes (<a href="/wiki/Angles.html" title="Angles">Angles</a>, <a href="/wiki/Saxons.html" title="Saxons">Saxons</a>) did not wipe out the Romano-British of England but rather, over the course of six centuries, conquered the native <a href="/wiki/Brythonic.html" title="Brythonic">Brythonic</a> people of what is now England and <a href="/wiki/Gododdin.html" title="Gododdin">south east Scotland</a> and imposed their culture and language upon them, in a manner similar to how Irish possibly spread over the west of Scotland. Still others maintain that the picture is mixed and that in some places the indigenous population was indeed wiped out while in others it was assimilated. According to this school of thought the populations of Yorkshire, East Anglia, Northumberland and the Orkney and Shetland Islands are those populations with the least traces of ancient (Celtic) British continuation <sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a  title="">[7]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>For obvious reasons the question of whether or not England originated with a <a href="/wiki/Genocide.html" title="Genocide">Genocide</a> against the indigenous, culturally Celtic, population is highly controversial and has clear political overtones - particularly with the contemporary emergence of strong <a href="/wiki/Nationalist.html" title="Nationalist">Nationalist</a> movements in <a href="/wiki/Scotland.html" title="Scotland">Scotland</a>, <a href="/wiki/Wales.html" title="Wales">Wales</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Cornwall.html" title="Cornwall">Cornwall</a> and the ongoing conflict in <a href="/wiki/Northern_Ireland.html" title="Northern Ireland">Northern Ireland</a>.</p>

<h2>Roman influence</h2>
<p>At the dawn of history in Europe, the Celts in present-day <a href="/wiki/France.html" title="France">France</a> were known as Gauls. Their descendants were described by <a href="/wiki/Julius_Caesar.html" title="Julius Caesar">Julius Caesar</a> in his <i><a href="/wiki/Gallic_Wars.html" title="Gallic Wars">Gallic Wars</a></i>. There was also an early Celtic presence in northern <a href="/wiki/Italy.html" title="Italy">Italy</a>. Other Celtic tribes invaded Italy, establishing there a city they called Mediolanum (modern <a href="/wiki/Milan.html" title="Milan">Milan</a>) and sacking <a href="/wiki/Rome.html" title="Rome">Rome</a> itself in <a href="/wiki/390_BC.html" title="390 BC">390 BC</a> following the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_the_Allia.html" title="Battle of the Allia">Battle of the Allia</a>.</p>
<p>The Celts settled much further south of the Po River than many maps show. Remnants in the town of Doccia, in the province of Emilia-Romagna, showcase Celtic houses in very good condition dating from about the 4th century BC.</p>
<p>A century later the defeat of the combined <a href="/wiki/Samnium.html" title="Samnium">Samnite</a>, Celtic and <a href="/wiki/Etruscan_civilization.html" title="Etruscan civilization">Etruscan</a> alliance by the Romans in the <a href="/wiki/Samnite_Wars.html" title="Samnite Wars">Third Samnite War</a> sounded the end of the Celtic domination in Europe, but it was not until <a href="/wiki/192_BC.html" title="192 BC">192 BC</a> that the Roman armies conquered the last remaining independent Celtic kingdoms in Italy.</p>
<p>Under Caesar the Romans conquered Celtic Gaul, and from <a href="/wiki/Claudius.html" title="Claudius">Claudius</a> onward the Roman empire absorbed parts of the Celtic <a href="/wiki/British_Isles.html" title="British Isles">British Isles</a>.

<p>The native peoples under Roman rule became Romanized and keen to adopt Roman ways. <a href="/wiki/Celtic_art.html" title="Celtic art">Celtic art</a> had already incorporated classical influences, and surviving Gallo-Roman pieces interpret classical subjects or keep faith with old traditions despite a Roman overlay.</p>

<h2>Celts pushed west by Germanic migration</h2>
<p>Celts were pushed westwards by successive waves of <a href="/wiki/Germanic_tribes.html" title="Germanic tribes">Germanic</a> invaders, perhaps themselves at times pressured by <a href="/wiki/Huns.html" title="Huns">Huns</a> and <a href="/wiki/Scythians.html" title="Scythians">Scythians</a> or simply population pressures in their homeland of <a href="/wiki/Scandinavia.html" title="Scandinavia">Scandinavia</a> and Northern Germany. With the <a href="/wiki/Fall_of_the_Roman_Empire.html" title="Fall of the Roman Empire">fall of the Roman Empire</a> the Celts of <a href="/wiki/Gaul.html" title="Gaul">Gaul</a>, Iberia and <a href="/wiki/Britannia.html" title="Britannia">Britannia</a> were "conquered" by tribes speaking <a href="/wiki/Germanic_language.html" title="Germanic language">Germanic languages</a>.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, the Celtic populations were assimilated by others, leaving behind them only a legend and a number of place names such as <a href="/wiki/Bohemia.html" title="Bohemia">Bohemia</a>, after the Boii tribe which once lived there, or the Kingdom of <a href="/wiki/Belgium.html" title="Belgium">Belgium</a>, after the Belgae, a mixed Celtic-Germanic tribe of Northern Gaul and south-eastern England. Their mythology has been absorbed into the folklore of half a dozen other countries. For instance, the famous Medieval English Arthurian tale of <i><a href="/wiki/Sir_Gawain_and_the_Green_Knight.html" title="Sir Gawain and the Green Knight">Sir Gawain and the Green Knight</a></i> is almost certainly partially derived from the medieval Irish text <a  class="new" title="Fled Bricrend">Fled Bricrend</a> <cite>(The Feast of <a href="/wiki/Briccriu.html" title="Briccriu">Bricriu</a>)</cite>.</p>
<p>Argument rages in the academic world as to whether or not the Celts in England were mostly wiped out/pushed west as the lack of evidence for influence of the Celts on <a href="/wiki/Anglo-Saxons.html" title="Anglo-Saxons">Anglo-Saxon</a> society suggests. Many historians now argue that the Teuton migration was smaller than previously believed or may have consisted merely of a social elite and that the genocide was cultural rather than physical due to such relatively few numbers of Anglo-Saxons mixing with the larger native population. A recent DNA study on Y-chromosome inheritance has suggested that the population of England maintains a predominantly ancient British element. The general indigenous population of Yorkshire, East Anglia and the Orkney and Shetland Islands are those populations with the least traces of ancient British paternal continuation <sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a  title="">[8]</a></sup>. Ironically, it may be Viking genetic influence and not Anglo-Saxon which has had a more profound impact on paternal British bloodlines, or it could very well have been a combination of both groups.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Celtic social system and arts">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Celtic_social_system_and_arts" id="Celtic_social_system_and_arts"></a></p>
<h2>Celtic social system and arts</h2>
<p>To the extent that sources are available, they depict a pre-Christian Celtic social structure based formally on class and kinship. Patron-client relationships similar to those of Roman society are also described by Caesar and others in the Gaul of the first century BCE.</p>
<p>In the main, the evidence is of tribes being led by kings, although some argue that there is evidence of oligarchical republican forms of government eventually emerging in areas in close contact with Rome. Most descriptions of Celtic societies describe them as being divided into three groups: a warrior aristocracy; an intellectual class including professions such as druid, poet, and jurist; and everyone else. There are instances recorded where women participated both in warfare and in kingship, although they were in the minority in these areas. In historical times, the offices of high and low kings in Ireland and Scotland were filled by election under the system of <a href="/wiki/Tanistry.html" title="Tanistry">tanistry</a>, which eventually came into conflict with the feudal principle of <a href="/wiki/Primogeniture.html" title="Primogeniture">primogeniture</a> where the succession goes to the first born son.</p>
<p>Little is known of family structure, but <a href="/wiki/Athenaeus.html" title="Athenaeus">Athenaeus</a> in his <i>Deipnosophists,</i> 13.603, claims that "the Celts, in spite of the fact that their women are very beautiful, prefer boys as sexual partners. There are some of them who will regularly go to bed ‚Äì on those animal skins of theirs ‚Äì with a pair of lovers", implying a woman <i>and</i> a boy. <a href="/wiki/Pederasty.html" title="Pederasty">Age-structured homosexuality</a> was common in pre-Christian European cultures and accepted as normal by the Romans and the Greeks. It would be wrong to blindly accept this as truth; as the Greeks had a very limited view on Celtic society. Unfortunately, the Celts didn't write for themselves and we have only this to go by.</p>
<p>Warfare appears to have been a regular feature of Celtic societies. While epic literature depicts this as more of a sport focused on raids and hunting rather than organised territorial conquest, the historical record is more of tribes using warfare to exert political control and harass rivals, for economic advantage, and in some instances to conquer territory. <a href="/wiki/Dionysius.html" title="Dionysius">Dionysius</a> said that their "manner of fighting, being in large measure that of wild beasts and frenzied, was an erratic procedure, quite lacking in military science. Thus, at one moment they would raise their swords aloft and smite after the manner of wild boars, throwing the whole weight of their bodies into the blow like hewers of wood or men digging with mattocks, and again they would deliver crosswise blows aimed at no target, as if they intended to cut to pieces the entire bodies of their adversaries, protective armour and all"<a  class="external autonumber" title="http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Dionysius_of_Halicarnassus/14*.html">[1]</a>. They also liked to play games such as <a href="/wiki/Fidchell.html" title="Fidchell">fidchell</a> and <a href="/wiki/Hurling.html" title="Hurling">hurling</a>.</p>
<p>Patterns of settlement varied from decentralised to the urban. The popular stereotype of non-urbanised societies settled in <a href="/wiki/Hillfort.html" title="Hillfort">hillforts</a> and <a href="/wiki/Dun.html" title="Dun">duns</a>, drawn from Britain and Ireland contrasts with the urban settlements present in the core Hallstatt and La Tene areas, with the many significant oppida of Gaul late in the first millennium BCE, and with the towns of Gallia Cisalpina.</p>
<p>There is archaeological evidence to suggest that the pre-Roman Celtic societies were tied into the network of overland trade routes that spanned <a href="/wiki/Eurasia.html" title="Eurasia">Eurasia</a> from Ireland to China. Celtic traders were also in contact with the Phoenicians: gold works made in Pre-Roman Ireland have been unearthed in archaeological digs in Palestine, and trade routes between Atlantic societies and Palestine date back to at least 1600 BC.</p>
<p>Local trade was largely in the form of barter, but as with most tribal societies they probably had a reciprocal economy in which goods and other services are not exchanged, but are given on the basis of mutual relationships and the obligations of kinship. Low value coinages of potin, silver and bronze, suitable for use in trade, were minted in most Celtic areas of the continent, and in South-East Britain prior to the Roman conquest of these areas.</p>
<p>There are only very limited records from pre-Christian times written in Celtic languages. These are mostly inscriptions in the Roman, and sometimes Greek, alphabets. The <a href="/wiki/Ogham.html" title="Ogham">Ogham</a> script was mostly used in early Christian times in Ireland and Scotland, and was only used for ceremonial purposes such as inscriptions on gravestones. The available evidence is of a strong oral tradition, such as that preserved by bards in Ireland, and eventually recorded by monasteries. The oldest recorded rhyming poetry in the world is of Irish origin and is a transcription of a much older epic poem, leading some scholars to claim that the Celts invented <a href="/wiki/Rhyme.html" title="Rhyme">Rhyme</a>. They were highly skilled in visual arts and <a href="/wiki/Celtic_art.html" title="Celtic art">Celtic art</a> produced a great deal of intricate and beautiful metalwork, examples of which have been preserved by their distinctive burial rites.</p>
<p>In some regards the Atlantic Celts were conservative, for example they still used <a href="/wiki/Chariot.html" title="Chariot">chariots</a> in combat long after they had been reduced to ceremonial roles by the Greeks and Romans, though when faced with the Romans in Britain, their chariot tactics defeated the invasion attempted by <a href="/wiki/Julius_Caesar.html" title="Julius Caesar">Julius Caesar</a>.</p>

<p>Although Celtic gods varied from region to region and tribe to tribe, the Celtic religion had some patterns. For example like Mediterranean cultures most early Celts worshipped in sacred groves. This was once postulated to have occurred because of Celts trading with Mediterranean cultures; however, evidence from Hallstatt era finds show that the earliest Celts practiced this before such trade took place. More reasonably, it is a byproduct of most primitive religion to worship in such a way. However, <a href="/wiki/La_T%C3%A8ne_culture.html" title="La T√®ne culture">La T√®ne</a> Celts also built temples of varying size and shape, though they still usually maintained sacred trees, or votive pools. Worship was, in this way, deferred to temples, when they were available. Numerous temples were converted by the Romans, and with little difficulty; the design was rather similar to Roman temples, as they were both highly influenced by the Greeks, architecturally speaking.</p>
<p>Their druid positions vary; a druid is not always a priest. Druids are any members of a Celtic society who had what we would view today as a college education. The most educated druids were usually doctors, priests, and heralds, as these occupations required the most memorization and skill for their practices. Priests from this class were in charge of a great deal of religious festivals, as well as organizing the calendar; a daunting task as the Celtic calendar is incredibly accurate, but required manual correction about every 40 years, meaning lengthy mathematic discourse.</p>
<p>Druids also carried out sacrifices of crops and animals. In a Celtic society, people were not executed for crimes. Essus was, more or less, a benevolent law god to many Celts, particularly Gauls. However, Essus worship also intoned a sense of merciless behavior toward repeated criminals, rapists, traitors, and other societal dregs. The offender, if found guilty, would be taken to the temple of Essus, where an oak would be growing through an opening in the temple roof. His stomach would be cut open, and he would be hung from an oak branch.</p>
<p>The Celts' gods were often named after natural things. For example the source of rivers would often have their own goddesses, though rarely many gods. Another theme with Celt gods were triple deities; not only goddesses, but numerous gods. For example the Mothers of Britain, or Cromm Cruach's slovenly, deific, and humanistic forms. The main deities of Celtic religion, contrary to much misconception, were usually male. The world in some remaining myths is often depicted as having been forged by a god with a hammer, such as Dagda or Sucellos, who then poured all life from a magic cauldron or cup; a source of pre-Christian 'Holy Grail' myths in Celtic societies.</p>
<p>While deities varied, several constant deities or demigods existed over a wide area. A great example is Lugos, a heroic sun god from Gaul and the southern, Gallic parts of Britain. He is also known as Lugh (in Ireland), Lleu (in Wales), and Lug (among Celtiberians, who were not culturally true Celts). Early depictions of him exist as early as the Hallstatt era, suggesting him as one of the longest existing gods of Celtic religion. Similar is the horse and fertility goddess, Epona, who was also worshipped by the Romans when they came to rule Gaul. She also seems to have existed from the early era. Finally, there is Sucellos, who is argued by some to have been the 'creator of the universe' in some Celtic religions. He is party to Dagda of Ireland, and was worshipped over an enormous area, including by non-Celtic peoples such as the Lusitani. He was the patron god of the Ordovices tribe of Britain, and was built up by the Arverni and their allies to replace the druidic god Cernunnos, as the Gallic druids were allies of their enemies in the rule for Gaul; the Aedui.</p>
<p>Other religious practices also existed; Celts seem to have universally removed body hair. Some postulate this as religious, but was more realistically part of the Celtic propensity for cleanliness. Body hair kept dirt close to the body, and Celts were an extremely clean people, so this was unacceptable. However, Celts also took heads from dead enemies. This was definitely a religious practice in origin. However, even post-Christian Gaels continued this practice into the middle ages; some Irish even took to scalping the heads that they took, so they could braid the scalp through rings on their weapons. The religious connotations by that point were slim, but it does imply that taking heads had incredible cultural importance to have persisted so long after the religious background had been removed. To our understanding, Celts believed the soul resided in the head, and that capturing a head meant that one captured the soul of an opponent, and that when a Celt died, the dead whom he had collected would serve him as slaves for eternity. There is no proof of this.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Celts as head-hunters">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Celts_as_head-hunters" id="Celts_as_head-hunters"></a></p>
<h2>Celts as head-hunters</h2>
<p>"Amongst the Celts the human head was venerated above all else, since the head was to the Celt the soul, centre of the emotions as well as of life itself, a symbol of divinity and of the powers of the other-world." - Paul Jacobsthal, <i>Early Celtic Art</i>.</p>
<p>The Celtic cult of the severed head is documented not only in the many sculptured representations of severed heads in <a href="/wiki/La_T%C3%A8ne_culture.html" title="La T√®ne culture">La T√®ne</a> carvings, but in the surviving Celtic mythology, which is full of stories of the severed heads of heroes and the saints who carry their decapitated heads, right down to <i><a href="/wiki/Sir_Gawain_and_the_Green_Knight.html" title="Sir Gawain and the Green Knight">Sir Gawain and the Green Knight</a></i>, where the <a href="/wiki/Green_Knight.html" title="Green Knight">Green Knight</a> picks up his own severed head after Gawain has struck it off, just as <a href="/wiki/St._Denis.html" title="St. Denis">St. Denis</a> carried his head to the top of <a href="/wiki/Montmartre.html" title="Montmartre">Montmartre</a>. Separated from the mundane body, although still alive, the animated head acquires the ability to see into the mythic realm.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Diodorus_Siculus.html" title="Diodorus Siculus">Diodorus Siculus</a>, in his 1st century <i>History</i> had this to say about Celtic head-hunting: "They cut off the heads of enemies slain in battle and attach them to the necks of their horses. The blood-stained spoils they hand over to their attendants and carry off as booty, while striking up a paean and singing a song of victory; and they nail up these first fruits upon their houses, just as do those who lay low wild animals in certain kinds of hunting. They embalm in cedar oil the heads of the most distinguished enemies, and preserve them carefully in a chest, and display them with pride to strangers, saying that for this head one of their ancestors, or his father, or the man himself, refused the offer of a large sum of money. They say that some of them boast that they refused the weight of the head in gold; thus displaying what is only a barbarous kind of magnanimity, for it is not a sign of nobility to refrain from selling the proofs of one's valour. It is rather true that it is bestial to continue one's hostility against a slain fellow man."</p>
<p>The Celts also believed that if they attached the head of their enemy to a pole or a fence near their house, the head would start crying when the enemy was near. Also if the enemy who's head was taken was important enough they would put it in a church and pray to it believing it had magic powers.</p>
<p>The Celtic headhunters venerated the image of the severed head as a continuing source of spiritual power. If the head is the seat of the soul, possessing the severed head of an enemy, honorably reaped in battle, added prestige to any warrior's reputation. According to tradition the buried head of a god or hero named <a href="/wiki/Bran_the_Blessed.html" title="Bran the Blessed">Bran the Blessed</a> protected <a href="/wiki/Britain.html" title="Britain">Britain</a> from invasion across the <a href="/wiki/English_Channel.html" title="English Channel">English Channel</a>.</p>

<h2>Names for Celts</h2>
<p>The origin of the various names used since classical times for the people known today as the Celts is obscure and has been controversial. It appears that none of the terms recorded were ever used by Celtic speakers of themselves. In particular, there is no record of the term "Celt" being used in connection with the inhabitants of Ireland and Britain prior to the 19th century.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: The name &quot;Gauls&quot;">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="The_name_.22Gauls.22" id="The_name_.22Gauls.22"></a></p>
<h3>The name "Gauls"</h3>
<p>English <i>Gaul(s)</i> and Latin <i>Gallus</i> or <i>Galli</i> might be from an originally Celtic ethnic or tribal name (perhaps borrowed into Latin during the early <a href="/wiki/400s_BC.html" title="400s BC">400s BC</a>, Celtic expansions into Italy). Its root may be the Common Celtic <i>*galno</i>, meaning "power" or "strength". Greek <i>Galatai</i> (see <a href="/wiki/Galatia.html" title="Galatia">Galatia</a> in Anatolia) seems to be based on the same root, borrowed directly from the same hypothetical Celtic source which gave us <i>Galli</i> (the suffix -atai is simply an ethnic name indicator).</p>
<p>The English form <i>Gaul</i> comes from the French <i>Gaule</i> and <i>Gaulois</i>, which is the traditional rendering of Latin <i>Gallia</i> and <i>Gallus, -icus</i> respectively. However, the diphthong <i>au</i> points to a different origin, namely a Romance adaptation of the Germanic *<i>Walha-</i>. See <a href="/wiki/Gaul#Name.html" title="Gaul">Gaul#Name</a>.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: The word &quot;Welsh&quot;">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="The_word_.22Welsh.22" id="The_word_.22Welsh.22"></a></p>
<h3>The word "Welsh"</h3>
<p>The word Welsh is a Germanic word, yet it may ultimately have a Celtic source. It may be the result of an early borrowing (in the <a href="/wiki/4th_century_BC.html" title="4th century BC">4th century BC</a>) of the Celtic tribal name <a href="/wiki/Volcae.html" title="Volcae">Volcae</a> into early Germanic (becoming the <a href="/wiki/Proto-Germanic.html" title="Proto-Germanic">Proto-Germanic</a> <a href="/wiki/Walh.html" title="Walh">*Walh-</a>, "foreigner of the Roman lands" and the suffixed form *Walhisk-). The Volcae were one of the Celtic peoples that for two centuries barred the southward expansion of the Germanic tribes in what is now central Germany on the line of the <a href="/wiki/Hartz_mountains.html" title="Hartz mountains">Hartz mountains</a> and into <a href="/wiki/Saxony.html" title="Saxony">Saxony</a> and <a href="/wiki/Silesia.html" title="Silesia">Silesia</a>.</p>
<p>In the middle ages certain districts of what is now Germany were known as "Welschland" as opposed to "Deutschland", and the word is cognate with <a href="/wiki/Vlach.html" title="Vlach">Vlach</a> (see: <a href="/wiki/Etymology_of_Vlach.html" title="Etymology of Vlach">Etymology of Vlach</a>) and <a href="/wiki/Walloons.html" title="Walloons">Walloon</a> as well as the 'wall' in Cornwall. During the early Germanic period, the term seems to have been applied to the peasant population of the Roman Empire, most of whom were, in the areas immediately settled by the Germanic people, of ultimately Celtic origin.</p>

<p><a name="The_name_.22Celts.22" id="The_name_.22Celts.22"></a></p>
<h3>The name "Celts"</h3>
<p>English Celt(s), Latin Celtus pl. Celti (Celtae), Greek ŒöŒ≠ŒªœÑŒ∑œÇ pl. ŒöŒ≠ŒªœÑŒµœÇ seem to be based on a native Celtic ethnic name (singular *Celtos or *Celta with plurals *Celtoi or *Celta:s), of unsure etymology. The root would seem to be a Primitive Indo-European *kel- or (s)kel-, but there are several such roots of various meanings to choose from (*kel- "to be prominent", *kel- "to drive or set in motion", *kel- "to strike or cut" etc.)</p>
