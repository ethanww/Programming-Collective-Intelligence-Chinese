The area was first settled in 1839 by Peter Anderson, a <a href="/wiki/Scotland.html" title="Scotland">Scots</a> migrant, who named it Burnside after his property's location adjacent to Second Creek (in <a href="/wiki/Scottish_Gaelic_language.html" title="Scottish Gaelic language">Scots</a>, 'Burn' means creek or stream). The <a href="/wiki/Burnside%2C_South_Australia.html" title="Burnside, South Australia">village of Burnside</a> was established shortly after, and the Burnside Council District was gazetted in 1856, separating itself from the larger East Torrens Council.</p>
<p>The mainstays of the early Burnside economy were <a href="/wiki/Viticulture.html" title="Viticulture">viticulture</a>, mining and olive groves; <a href="/wiki/Glen_Osmond%2C_South_Australia.html" title="Glen Osmond, South Australia">Glen Osmond</a> boasted substantial mineral deposits, and vineyards were established at <a href="/wiki/Magill%2C_South_Australia.html" title="Magill, South Australia">Magill</a>. The present council chambers were built in 1926 in <a href="/wiki/Tusmore%2C_South_Australia.html" title="Tusmore, South Australia">Tusmore</a>; the council became a <a href="/wiki/Municipality.html" title="Municipality">municipality</a> in 1935. With strong growth and development throughout the region, Burnside was then proclaimed a city in 1943. The 1960s brought to Burnside a community library and a swimming centre; both were further expanded and upgraded between 1997 and 2001. Today, Burnside is one of Adelaide's most sought-after regions in which to live.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a  title="">[1]</a></sup></p>

<h2>Aboriginal culture</h2>
<p>The Kaurna people were a <a href="/wiki/Hunter-gatherer.html" title="Hunter-gatherer">hunter-gatherer</a> society who inhabited the <a href="/wiki/Adelaide_Plains.html" title="Adelaide Plains">Adelaide Plains</a> and surrounding regions. Among their customs was the practice of <a href="/wiki/Fire-stick_farming.html" title="Fire-stick farming">fire-stick farming</a> (controlled <a href="/wiki/Bushfires.html" title="Bushfires">bushfires</a>) in the <a href="/wiki/Adelaide_Hills.html" title="Adelaide Hills">Adelaide Hills</a>, which the early European settlers spotted before the Kaurna people were displaced. The main Kaurna presence was in <a href="/wiki/Tarndanyangga.html" title="Tarndanyangga">Tarndanyangga</a> near the <a href="/wiki/River_Torrens.html" title="River Torrens">River Torrens</a> and the creeks that flowed into it, an area which became the site of the Adelaide settlement. By 1852, the population of the Kaurna was in steady decline, due largely to European diseases and displacement; at this stage, a census put their numbers at 650 in the Adelaide region. The Kaurna also resided in the Burnside area: an early settler of the village of <a href="/wiki/Beaumont%2C_South_Australia.html" title="Beaumont, South Australia">Beaumont</a> described the local Kaurna: "At every creek and gully you would see their wurlies [simple Aboriginal homes made out of twigs and grass] and their fires at night ... often as many as 500 to 600 would be camped in various places ... some behind the Botanic Gardens on the banks of the river; some toward the Ranges; some on the <a href="/wiki/Waterfall_Gully%2C_South_Australia.html" title="Waterfall Gully, South Australia">Waterfall Gully</a>."<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a  title="">[2]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a  title="">[3]</a></sup></p>

<p>The village of <a href="/wiki/Kensington%2C_South_Australia.html" title="Kensington, South Australia">Kensington</a> was established in May 1839, only 17 months after the foundation of the colony. The village was primarily agricultural and had a close relationship with the nearby village of <a href="/wiki/Norwood%2C_South_Australia.html" title="Norwood, South Australia">Norwood</a>. The two villages formed one of Adelaide's first <a href="/wiki/Municipality.html" title="Municipality">municipalities</a> in 1853 as Norwood and Kensington, evolving into today's <a href="/wiki/City_of_Norwood_Payneham_St_Peters.html" title="City of Norwood Payneham St Peters">City of Norwood Payneham St Peters</a>. Parts of Kensington that are now included in Burnside are the suburbs of <a href="/wiki/Kensington_Gardens%2C_South_Australia.html" title="Kensington Gardens, South Australia">Kensington Gardens</a> and <a href="/wiki/Kensington_Park%2C_South_Australia.html" title="Kensington Park, South Australia">Kensington Park</a>. The village of <a href="/wiki/Magill%2C_South_Australia.html" title="Magill, South Australia">Makgill</a> (later Magill) was first established as the 524-acre (?? hectare) Makgill Estate, owned by two Scots—Robert Cock and William Ferguson—who met onboard the <i>Buffalo</i> en route to the newly founded colony. It was named after Cock's trustee, David M Magkgill. Ferguson, who was charged with farming the estate, built the estate's homestead in 1838. Soon after farming started, the two were short of funds, and thus Magill became the first <a href="/wiki/Adelaide_Hills.html" title="Adelaide Hills">foothills</a> village to be subdivided.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a  title="">[4]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a  title="">[5]</a></sup> The village of <a href="/wiki/Glen_Osmond%2C_South_Australia.html" title="Glen Osmond, South Australia">Glen Osmond</a> was closely associated with the discovery of silver and lead on the slopes of <a href="/wiki/Mount_Osmond%2C_South_Australia.html" title="Mount Osmond, South Australia">Mount Osmond</a> by two Cornish immigrants. Their discovery of minerals provided the colony with valuable export income, at a time when the early South Australian economy was not yet established. <a href="/wiki/Governor_of_South_Australia.html" title="Governor of South Australia">Governor</a> <a href="/wiki/George_Gawler.html" title="George Gawler">Gawler</a> visited the early discovery and the first mine, <a href="/wiki/Wheal.html" title="Wheal">Wheal</a> Gawler, was named in his honour. South Australia's first mine exported overseas throughout the 1840s, providing employment to early Cornish and then German immigrants after several mines were bought by a German businessman. The early village assumed a strong Cornish, and later a German character.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a  title="">[6]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a  title="">[7]</a></sup></p>

<p>The Anderson family was the first to settle the land that was to become the village of Burnside. They brought with them good character testimonials from Scotland, valuable farming experience and 3000 pounds; however, the farming patterns in Scotland differed greatly from those in the antipodes, and the family failed to adapt. The Andersons moved on to <a href="/wiki/Morphett_Vale%2C_South_Australia.html" title="Morphett Vale, South Australia">Morphett Vale</a> in 1847, selling their land and abandoning their homestead. The buyer of the Anderson land, William Randell, soon decided to build a village in his new property in 1849. He hired surveyor and planner Nathan Hailes to lay out the new village. Hailes was both surprised and disappointed when he found that it had already been settled and left—especially since the growth and adaption of European foliage to the area.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a  title="">[8]</a></sup> The first villages to be established in the region, those of <a href="/wiki/Glen_Osmond%2C_South_Australia.html" title="Glen Osmond, South Australia">Glen Osmond</a>, <a href="/wiki/Magill%2C_South_Australia.html" title="Magill, South Australia">Magill</a> and <a href="/wiki/Kensington%2C_South_Australia.html" title="Kensington, South Australia">Kensington</a> had existed for some time when the new village of Burnside was proclaimed. The new village was in a good position to grow; it was bounded by two major thoroughfares, <a  class="new" title="Glynburn Road, Adelaide">Burnside</a> (now Glynburn) and <a href="/wiki/Greenhill_Road%2C_Adelaide.html" title="Greenhill Road, Adelaide">Greenhill</a> roads, and had the advantage of lying on Second Creek. The village was soon invested in by many owners; some of whom were wealthy Adelaide folk building an estate in the <a href="/wiki/Adelaide_Hills.html" title="Adelaide Hills">foothills</a>, and others who were more concerned with working the land. The village was described in advertisements by Hailes in 1850 as "<i>Burnside the Beautiful</i>" with advantages of "perpetual running water, extensive and diversified view, rich garden soil and good building stone ..." with a "... direct, newly-opened and unblemished route to Adelaide".<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a  title="">[9]</a></sup></p>

</div>
<p>Originally, all the villages in what was to become the Burnside District Council were in the then <a  class="new" title="East Torrens District Council">East Torrens District Council</a> of 159 km² (100&#160;sq.&#160;miles). East Torrens bordered the <a href="/wiki/River_Torrens.html" title="River Torrens">River Torrens</a> in the north, the <a href="/wiki/Adelaide_Hills.html" title="Adelaide Hills">Adelaide Hills</a> to the east, <a href="/wiki/Adelaide-Crafers_Highway.html" title="Adelaide-Crafers Highway">Mount Barker Road</a> to the south, and the <a href="/wiki/Adelaide_Parklands.html" title="Adelaide Parklands">Adelaide Parklands</a> to the west. East Torrens was gazetted in 1853 by the <i>District Councils Act 1852</i>; the Act stipulated that there be five elected members to the council, each representing a ward. Dr David Wark (<a href="/wiki/Rostrevor%2C_South_Australia.html" title="Rostrevor, South Australia">St Bernards</a>), James Cobbledick (<a href="/wiki/Uraidla%2C_South_Australia.html" title="Uraidla, South Australia">Uraidla</a>), Charles Bonney (<a href="/wiki/Norwood%2C_South_Australia.html" title="Norwood, South Australia">Norwood</a>), Daniel Ferguson (<a href="/wiki/Glenunga%2C_South_Australia.html" title="Glenunga, South Australia">Glenunga</a>) and George Müller (<a href="/wiki/Stepney%2C_South_Australia.html" title="Stepney, South Australia">Stepney</a>) were the council's first representatives. Bonney, in addition to being a councillor, was the Commissioner of Crown Lands. The councillors met for the first time at World's End Hotel in Magill on <a href="/wiki/June_12.html" title="June 12">June 12</a>, <a href="/wiki/1853.html" title="1853">1853</a>. Initial plans were put in place to first survey and evaluate the council area and to collect licence fees and taxes as provided for by the Council's Act. TB Penfold of Magill, a former captain, was to become the first District Clerk and Collector on <a href="/wiki/January_1.html" title="January 1">January 1</a>, <a href="/wiki/1854.html" title="1854">1854</a>. On <a href="/wiki/January_4.html" title="January 4">January 4</a>, <a href="/wiki/1854.html" title="1854">1854</a> there was a vote in which ratepayers decided on how much they would pay to the council (one shilling to a pound); it was also decided at this point to exempt charitable organisations, schools and churches from rates. In 1855 the population of the council area was 3,705, higher by a thousand than the adjacent <a href="/wiki/City_of_Norwood_Payneham_St_Peters.html" title="City of Norwood Payneham St Peters">Norwood-Kensington</a>.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a  title="">[10]</a></sup> The huge East Torrens was not to prove as stable as Norwood-Kensington. Ratepayers were frustrated as to where their money was going; councillors did not have the administration or funds to operate effectively and the interests of the area were hugely varied. The area was split into three in <a href="/wiki/August_14.html" title="August 14">August 14</a>, <a href="/wiki/1856.html" title="1856">1856</a>. The District Council of Payneham separated and formed to the north-west and the District Council of Burnside was formed in the south-eastern corner in an area of 15.9 km² (10&#160;sq&#160;miles).<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a  title="">[11]</a></sup> East Torrens was further divided in 1858 with the secession of <a href="/wiki/Adelaide_Hills_Council.html" title="Adelaide Hills Council">District Council of Crafers</a>.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a  title="">[12]</a></sup></p>

<h2>Lone Burnside</h2>
<p>After shedding the burden of less profitable and unwieldy land with its angry residents, Burnside was on its own. The new Burnside District Council held its first meeting at the Greengate Inn, <a href="/wiki/Tusmore%2C_South_Australia.html" title="Tusmore, South Australia">Tusmore</a> on <a href="/wiki/August_19.html" title="August 19">August 19</a>, <a href="/wiki/1856.html" title="1856">1856</a>. Due to the time it took to elect new councillors, it was not until <a href="/wiki/December_29.html" title="December 29">29 December</a> that the council met again. Dr Christopher Penfold, chairman, met the rest of the representatives there: Daniel Ferguson of <a href="/wiki/Glenunga%2C_South_Australia.html" title="Glenunga, South Australia">Glenunga</a>, Alexander Ferguson of <a href="/wiki/Toorak_Gardens%2C_South_Australia.html" title="Toorak Gardens, South Australia">Monreith</a>, John Townsend of <a href="/wiki/Magill%2C_South_Australia.html" title="Magill, South Australia">Magill</a> and James Grylls of <a href="/wiki/Beaumont%2C_South_Australia.html" title="Beaumont, South Australia">Belle Vue</a>.<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a  title="">[13]</a></sup> It was during this time that <a href="/wiki/Kent_Town%2C_South_Australia.html" title="Kent Town, South Australia">Kent Town</a> decided against becoming a part of Burnside and instead applied to enter <a href="/wiki/City_of_Norwood_Payneham_St_Peters.html" title="City of Norwood Payneham St Peters">Norwood-Kensington</a>. The council was to meet at the Inn or at Ferguson's home right up until December 1869, when the first council chambers were built. However, it was still able to operate and fulfill its obligations under the <i>Local Government Act 1852</i>. These included the management of minor roads, the administration of abattoir licences and public houses, and the prevention of the spread of the noxious <a href="/wiki/Scotch_thistle.html" title="Scotch thistle">Scotch thistle</a>. The council was also obliged, under a different act of 1851, to encourage education. Much road and bridgework activity happened after the council had been formed—early residents were amazed at the influx of development and construction that occurred. At the same time, the council was almost overwhelmed by the sheer number of resident requests, and was forced to ask individual ratepayers for monetary assistance when building bridges in their area.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a  title="">[14]</a></sup></p>
<p>Much of Burnside's history has been observed and documented by institutions that have remained an important part of the lives of its residents: the school and the church.<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a  title="">[15]</a></sup> The first school to open in the area was in Magill during 1846, preceding a proper statewide education system. <a href="/wiki/Magill_Primary_School.html" title="Magill Primary School">Magill Primary School</a> was enlarged in November 1855, when 38 boys and 29 girls enrolled; they were taught reading, writing, arithmetic, grammar, geography, history, drawing and singing by a sole teacher.

However, even with this intellectual spirit, the adult population was still relatively disadvantaged in the sphere of education. The drive for learning continued until the <a href="/wiki/Boer_War.html" title="Boer War">Boer War</a> placed more emphasis on physical activity and merit within society.

<p>By the turn of the century, Burnside was becoming more urbanised.

Ten per cent of the £60,000 budget consisted of commercial enterprise payments, while the rest was made up of ratepayer fees.<sup id="_ref-25" class="reference"><a  title="">[26]</a></sup> The <a href="/wiki/Government_of_South_Australia.html" title="Government of South Australia">South Australian Government</a> had enacted more laws in relation to local government, in particular, the <i>Town Planning Act 1920</i> and the <i>Building Act 1923</i>. These assigned more responsibility to councils, but at a time of necessity; Adelaide was gradually <a href="/wiki/Urban_sprawl.html" title="Urban sprawl">expanding</a>. Burnside councillors advised the State Government to acquire and manage pleasure resorts; a kiosk was opened at <a href="/wiki/Waterfall_Gully%2C_South_Australia.html" title="Waterfall Gully, South Australia">Waterfall Gully</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Morialta_Conservation_Park.html" title="Morialta Conservation Park">Morialta Conservation Park</a> established on this advice.

A post-war economic and baby boom under the <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Playford_IV.html" title="Thomas Playford IV">Playford Government</a> saw Burnside grow at a spectacular rate; from a population of 27,942 in 1947, it grew to 38,768 in 1961.<sup id="_ref-35" class="reference"><a  title="">[36]</a></sup> As <a href="/wiki/Suburbs.html" title="Suburbs">suburbs</a> devoured the remaining paddocks, 1953 saw the building of a public ballroom, 1965 saw an Olympic Grandstand; both in <a href="/wiki/Kensington_Park%2C_South_Australia.html" title="Kensington Park, South Australia">Kensington Park</a>. In 1963 the Cleland Conservation Park was founded on Burnside's eastern borders.<sup id="_ref-36" class="reference"><a  title="">[37]</a></sup></p>
<p>Burnside's road system was completely bitumenised during the 1960s and 1970s through government-sponsored roadworks programmes. Plans were also laid out to replace the windy and dangerous <a href="/wiki/Adelaide-Crafers_Highway.html" title="Adelaide-Crafers Highway">Mount Barker Road</a>. One of these proposals was the Burnside-Crafers Highway, which was strongly supported by council; it envisaged leaving <a href="/wiki/Greenhill_Road%2C_Adelaide.html" title="Greenhill Road, Adelaide">Greenhill Road</a> once reaching Hazelwood Park. It was then to pass through Hazelwood Park and <a href="/wiki/Beaumont%2C_South_Australia.html" title="Beaumont, South Australia">Beaumont</a>, wind around the hills of <a href="/wiki/Waterfall_Gully%2C_South_Australia.html" title="Waterfall Gully, South Australia">Waterfall Gully</a> and then go over <a href="/wiki/Eagle_on_the_Hill%2C_South_Australia.html" title="Eagle on the Hill, South Australia">Eagle on the Hill</a> to meet <a href="/wiki/Crafers%2C_South_Australia.html" title="Crafers, South Australia">Crafers</a>. The Burnside Council put much effort into this proposal, widening Linden Avenue (which runs north-west to south-east) in preparation for the highway. The proposal was eventually rejected in favour of upgrading Mount Barker Road and Linden Avenue remained a huge out-of-place road running through an otherwise peaceful suburb.<sup id="_ref-37" class="reference"><a  title="">[38]</a></sup></p>

The swimming centre in Hazelwood Park today</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Burnside gained a public library with a collection of 7,800 books in 1961 after it was first suggested in February 1959; the cost of establishing a library for the residents was more affordable since the <i>Libraries Act 1955</i> had been passed. The Burnside Swimming Centre opened in 1966; the swimming centre was a pet project of then-Mayor George Bolton, who had a grand vision of what he wanted <a href="/wiki/Hazelwood_Park%2C_Adelaide.html" title="Hazelwood Park, Adelaide">Hazelwood Park</a>, where the centre was to be located, to become. Bolton met unprecedented public opposition in 1964 when the idea was first unveiled. The substantial elderly population of Burnside (15%) was wholly opposed to the idea, suggesting the influx of troublemakers and noise was hardly worth the effort. The cost was estimated at £75,000. While architects were resigning over the scale of the proposed development and a number of residents were up in arms, the Adelaide newspapers had a ball; cartoonists throughout 1964 spent many of their daily cartoons covering the debacle. With the failure of a poll to decide the fate of the idea on <a href="/wiki/March_24.html" title="March 24">March 24</a> the <i><a href="/wiki/The_Advertiser_%28Australia%29.html" title="The Advertiser (Australia)">Sunday Mail</a></i> published the headline "Burnside Says <b>NO</b> to Swim Pool". Mayor Bolton was not dismayed by the result; he pushed ahead with his idea and announced new plans in December. After a strong public campaign and minor changes to the project a poll in February 1965 voted strongly in favour of the idea. The Mayor had won his battle and it was christened the <i>George Bolton Swimming Centre</i> in his honour upon opening.<sup id="_ref-38" class="reference"><a  title="">[39]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Burnside Council decided on an ambitious goal in 1967: for every 1,000 in population, five hectares of reserves were to be set aside. Setting out to achieve this the council purchased <a href="/wiki/Hazelwood_Park%2C_Adelaide.html" title="Hazelwood Park, Adelaide">Hazelwood Park</a> from the State Government, the <a  class="new" title="Beaumont Common, Adelaide">Beaumont Common</a> from its residents and parts of Mount Osmond were attained from the Highways Department. Before coming into the ownership of the council, Hazelwood Park was destined to be subdivided under a government initiative. When council heard of this, motions were put into place to take ownership and the deed was transferred in 1964. The council only managed this after discussions were held with Premier Playford himself.<sup id="_ref-39" class="reference"><a  title="">[40]</a></sup></p>

<p>A community centre was built alongside the council chambers in 1982, adjoining the library.

Further upgrades took place in 2001, resulting in a modern library and community centre for residents. Burnside developed a new council logo in 1993, utilising the colours of green and purple. Green represents the lush parks and reserves in Burnside, and purple represents the prominent <a href="/wiki/Jacaranda.html" title="Jacaranda">Jacaranda</a> trees.

A portion of the population emigrates to other Australian states and cities.
