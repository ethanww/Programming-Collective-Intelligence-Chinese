<h3>Origins and the early models</h3>
<p>In the <a href="/wiki/1970s.html" title="1970s">1970s</a>, <a href="/wiki/Texas_Instruments.html" title="Texas Instruments">Texas Instruments</a> was the main supplier of <a href="/wiki/Central_processing_unit.html" title="Central processing unit">CPUs</a> for use in calculators. Many companies sold calculator designs based on their chip sets, including Commodore. However, in <a href="/wiki/1975.html" title="1975">1975</a> TI increased the price to the point where the chip set alone cost more than what TI sold their entire calculators for, and the industry they had built up was frozen out of the market.</p>
<p>Commodore responded by looking for a chip set of their own they could purchase outright, and quickly found <a href="/wiki/MOS_Technology.html" title="MOS Technology">MOS Technology, Inc.</a> who were bringing their <a href="/wiki/MOS_Technology_6502.html" title="MOS Technology 6502">6502</a> microprocessor design to market. Along with the company came <a href="/wiki/Chuck_Peddle.html" title="Chuck Peddle">Chuck Peddle</a>'s <a href="/wiki/KIM-1.html" title="KIM-1">KIM-1</a> design, a small computer kit based on the 6502. At Commodore, Peddle convinced <a href="/wiki/Jack_Tramiel.html" title="Jack Tramiel">Jack Tramiel</a> that calculators were a dead-end. Instead they should focus on making a "real" machine out of the KIM-1, and selling that for much higher profits. Tramiel demanded that Peddle and Tramiel's son Leonard create a computer in time for the upcoming trade show <a href="/wiki/COMDEX.html" title="COMDEX">COMDEX</a>, and gave them six months to do it.</p>
<p>The result was the first all-in-one home computer, the <b>PET</b>. The first model was the <b>PET 2001</b>, including either 4 <a href="/wiki/Kilobyte.html" title="Kilobyte">kB</a> (the <b>2001-4</b>) or 8 kB (<b>2001-8</b>) of 8-bit <a href="/wiki/Random_access_memory.html" title="Random access memory">RAM</a>. It was essentially the KIM-1 with a new display chip (the <a href="/wiki/MOS_Technology_6545.html" title="MOS Technology 6545">MOS 6545</a>) driving a small built-in monochrome monitor with 40×25 character graphics. The machine also included a built-in <a href="/wiki/Datassette.html" title="Datassette">Datassette</a> for data storage located on the front of the case, which left little room for the keyboard. The 2001 was announced in <a href="/wiki/1977.html" title="1977">1977</a> and started deliveries around September. However they remained back-ordered for months, and to ease deliveries they eventually cancelled the 4 kB version early the next year.</p>
<p>Although the machine was fairly successful, there were frequent complaints about the tiny keyboard, often referred to as a "chicklet keyboard" because the keys resembled the popular gum candy. This was addressed in upgraded "dash N" and "dash B" versions of the 2001, which put the cassette outside the case, and included a much larger and better feeling keyboard. Internally a newer and simpler motherboard was used, along with an upgrade in memory to 8, 16, or 32 kB, known as the <b>2001-N-8</b>, <b>2001-N-16</b> or <b>2001-N-32</b>, respectively.</p>
<p>Sales of the newer machines was strong, and Commodore then introduced the models to Europe. However there was already a machine called PET for sale in Europe from the huge Dutch <a href="/wiki/Philips.html" title="Philips">Philips</a> company, and the name had to be changed. The result was the <b>CBM 3000</b> series ('CBM' standing for Commodore Business Machines), which included the <b>3008</b>, <b>3016</b> and <b>3032</b> models. Like the 2001-N-8, the 3008 was quickly dropped.</p>

<h3>Education, business, and computer science</h3>
<p>The final version of what could be thought of as the "classic" PET was the <b>PET 4000</b> series.</p>
<p>This was essentially the later model 2000 series, but with a larger black-and-green monitor and a newer version of <a href="/wiki/Commodore_BASIC.html" title="Commodore BASIC">Commodore's BASIC</a> programming language.</p>
<p>By this point Commodore had noticed that many customers were buying the "low memory" versions of the machines and installing their own RAM chips, so the <b>4008</b> and <b>4016</b> had the sockets punched out of the motherboard.</p>
<p>The <b>4032</b> was a huge success in schools, where its tough all-metal construction and all-in-one design made it better able to stand up to the rigors of classroom use. Just as important in this role was the PET's otherwise underutilized <a href="/wiki/IEEE_488.html" title="IEEE 488">IEEE 488</a> port. Used wisely, the port could be used as a simple "network" and allowed printers and disk drives (then very expensive) to be shared among all of the machines in the classroom.</p>
<p>Two more machines were released in the PET series. The <b>CBM 8000</b> included a new display chip which drove an 80×25 character screen, but this resulted in a number of software incompatibilities with programs designed for the 40 column screen, and it appears to have been unpopular as a result.</p>
<p>The machine shipped with 32 kB standard as the <b>8032</b>, but allowed another 64 kB to be added externally. Later the upgrade was installed from the factory, creating the <b>8096</b>. Later models used an improved case with a separate keyboard and swivel mount for the monitor, known as the <b>SK'</b>s and <b>Execudesk</b>.</p>
<p>The last in the series was the <b>SP9000</b>, known as the <b>SuperPET</b> or <b><a href="/wiki/MicroMainframe.html" title="MicroMainframe">MicroMainframe</a></b>. This machine was designed at the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Waterloo.html" title="University of Waterloo">University of Waterloo</a> for teaching programming. In addition to the basic CBM 8000 hardware, the 9000 added a second <a href="/wiki/Central_processing_unit.html" title="Central processing unit">CPU</a> in the form of the <a href="/wiki/Motorola_6809.html" title="Motorola 6809">Motorola 6809</a> and included a number of programming languages including BASIC in <a href="/wiki/Read-only_memory.html" title="Read-only memory">ROM</a> for the 6502 and <a href="/wiki/APL_programming_language.html" title="APL programming language">APL</a>, COBOL, <a href="/wiki/FORTRAN.html" title="FORTRAN">FORTRAN</a>, <a href="/wiki/Pascal_programming_language.html" title="Pascal programming language">Pascal</a> and a 6809 assembler on floppies for the 6809. It also included a terminal program which allowed the machine to be used as a "smart terminal" as well, so this single machine could replace many of the boxes currently in use at the university. Additionally this machine became a remote development environment where the user could later upload their creation to a mainframe after completing development and testing on the SuperPET.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: The graphics issue">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="The_graphics_issue" id="The_graphics_issue"></a></p>
<h3>The graphics issue</h3>
<p>In the home computer market the line was soon outsold by machines that included <a href="/wiki/Bitmap.html" title="Bitmap">bitmapped</a> color graphics and sound, mainly the <a href="/wiki/Apple_II.html" title="Apple II">Apple II</a> (introduced in 1977, the same year as the PET 2001), <a href="/wiki/Atari_8-bit_family.html" title="Atari 8-bit family">Atari 400/800</a> (1979), and, in particular, Commodore's own bestselling <a href="/wiki/Commodore_VIC-20.html" title="Commodore VIC-20">VIC-20</a> (1980/81). The mainstream business computer market of the time considered colors and graphics somewhat less of an issue; a view that would change soon enough.</p>
<p>Bitmapping and colors aside, the main limitation of the PETs' graphics capabilities was that the <a href="/wiki/Character_set.html" title="Character set">character set</a> was "<a href="/wiki/Hardwired.html" title="Hardwired">hardwired</a>" in <a href="/wiki/Read-only_memory.html" title="Read-only memory">ROM</a>. On the PET range's home computer rivals, the look-up address of the character graphics could be changed and pointed to <a href="/wiki/Random_access_memory.html" title="Random access memory">RAM</a>, where new characters could be drawn by a programmer to create custom graphics shapes. From a programming point of view, this was a relatively simple method of producing good-looking graphics images, and because of this, as well as the acceptable speed obtainable by a BASIC program moving character objects on the screen compared to bitmap graphics, many programs with a certain amount of graphics, including a fair amount of games, were made this way even on bitmap-capable machines. The PETs' lack of the character set remapping feature must therefore be said to constitute a major weakness in the machines' design.</p>
<p>On the upside, the PETs' ROM-restricted character set—an ASCII-1963 deviation known as <a href="/wiki/PETSCII.html" title="PETSCII">PETSCII</a>—was one of the most varied and flexible of the era, allowing PET games with rudimentary graphics to be created, exemplified by clones of video games such as <i><a href="/wiki/Space_Invaders.html" title="Space Invaders">Space Invaders</a></i>. Also, the many popular <a href="/wiki/Interactive_fiction.html" title="Interactive fiction">text adventure</a> games of the time, some multiplatform, some created for the PET line, did not need graphics at all.</p>

<p><a name="Cursor_magazine" id="Cursor_magazine"></a></p>
<h3><i>Cursor</i> magazine</h3>
<p>In the late 1970s and early 1980s, PET users could subscribe to a regularly issued "magazine" entitled <i>Cursor</i> that was published by Ron Jeffries of The Code Works. <i>Cursor</i> consisted of a PET-compatible data cassette tape containing a half dozen or so games and utility programs written by contributing freelance programmers. Also included with each tape was a short newsletter that contained instructions for the programs on the tape and occasional notes and updates on Commodore and the rest of the personal computer industry.</p>
