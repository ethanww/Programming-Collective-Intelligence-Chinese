<p>The second stage of IBM's development belonged to Thomas J Watson's sons - Arthur K and, in particular, Tom Jr. - who 'nepotistically' succeeded their father<a  class="external autonumber" title="http://futureobservatory.dyndns.org/9034.htm">[1]</a>. Such 'nepotism' is not unique, though the dynastic aspects of the <a href="/wiki/IBM.html" title="IBM">IBM</a> transfer of power - more redolent of the Roman Empire than a business - perhaps were. Many owners of businesses pass on their mantle to the next generation. <a  class="new" title="T J Watson">T J Watson</a> was, however, not the owner in the true sense. He was a manager, an employee, with only a very small personal stockholding. Yet such was his personal domination over the company that the succession was seen as a foregone conclusion. Despite this 'handicap' it is arguable that they became the most successful, though not the most spectacular, businessmen of their generation. Dick, the younger son, built World Trade (the overseas, non‑US, element of IBM) to match the strength of the US operation.</p>

<h2>TOM WATSON JR <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://futureobservatory.dyndns.org/9034.htm">[2]</a></h2>
<p>Greatest of all, though, was his elder brother Tom Watson Jr; for he created the IBM that came to rule the world. It was he who made IBM a computer company, masterminding the two great gambles; the first when IBM invested heavily to move into computing (then a non‑existent market), and the second when it invested even more heavily to launch the S/360 (which made its position virtually unassailable until the 1990s). It was he that made the laboratories almost an equal of the sales‑force, to supply the ever increasing demand for new technologies. At the same time he developed the organisation, and the philosophies, to successfully cope with the bureaucratic challenges that inevitably face (and often destroy) entrenched market‑leaders of IBM's size. His development of some unique philosophies was at the heart of the management style that powered IBM from the 1950s to the 1980s.</p>
<p>As a result IBM grew faster than even under his father, at a staggering 30% per annum compound for the next two decades. Yet he remains a largely unsung hero, dismissed by most commentators as a son - harbouring impossible dreams and impractical ideas, riding on his father's achievements.</p>
<p>What is particularly surprising was the degree of success that was achieved by the sons, and by Tom Jr in particular. Conventional business theory, perhaps rather dogmatically, would dismiss nepotism as a means of providing sound management. Indeed it may be that the refusal of the various commentators to recognise the true greatness of Tom Jr's contributions (and to dismiss him merely as an inheritor of his father's achievements, and his ideas as impractical nonsense) may owe something to an unwillingness to countenance the idea that (morally repugnant) nepotism can still produce successful managers. Yet the sons, in the case of IBM, showed more vision and courage than any of their more conventionally recruited contemporaries. Under their guidance IBM grew to be a true computer giant; achieving a dominance that it retained until the 1990s.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: FORMATIVE YEARS">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="FORMATIVE_YEARS" id="FORMATIVE_YEARS"></a></p>
<h2>FORMATIVE YEARS</h2>
<p>Thomas Watson Jr. was born on January 14th 1914 just before his father was summarily, and so traumatically, dismissed from NCR. Then came two daughters, Jane and Helen, before the younger son, Arthur Kittredge (and rather oddly thereafter known as 'Dick') was born.</p>
<p>Both sons were immersed in IBM from a very early age; Tom Watson Jr. was later to say that IBM was always in his unconscious. He was taken on plant inspections - his first memory of such a visit (to the Dayton factory) was at the age of five - business tours to Europe and he made appearances at the Hundred Per Cent Club even before he was old enough to attend school. In the home, Thomas Senior's discipline was erratic and often harsh and irrational. Around the time he was thirteen Tom Jr. began to suffer recurring depressions. These continued for six years and - in his autobiography - he claimed that (according to the standards of later times) his behaviour then would have been seen as a symptom of clinical depression. It is accordingly always possible that a rebellion against these 'impositions' in their formative years was one of the factors that influenced both their management styles later at IBM.</p>
<p>Talking to a reporter in 1974 Tom Watson Jr described his relationship with his father; "My father and I had terrible fights.....He seemed like a blanket that covered everything. I really wanted to beat him but also make him proud of me". But this relationship was not all negative as Tom himself admitted in the same interview; "I really enjoyed the ten years (working) with him". In his own book (Father Son &amp; Co.), on the very first page, he gives his own comment of the force that drove him; "I was so intimately entwined with my father. I had a compelling desire, maybe out of honor for the old gentleman, maybe out of sheer cussedness, to prove to the world that I could excel in the same way that he did."</p>
<p>Certainly Tom Jr., handicapped by imperfect eye-hand coordination which had also adversely affected his reading[1], started out as a determinedly mediocre student. This was despite the fact that, in later years, he was clearly one of the most intelligent businessmen of his generation; a potential that only Benjamin Wood, a professor at Columbia (who tested the young Tom), seems to have detected[2] - for he seems to have managed to hide his true potential from almost everybody else! He only scraped into Brown University (and even then on his father's name); clearly showing he was not interested in most of the course while there. He was instead the young playboy (though that was the traditional employment for his also-wealthy contemporaries). In his autobiography, he stated that, when he was a boy, "....I got it into my head that the Old Man wanted to me to come into IBM, take it over and run the whole deal. The very idea made me miserable."</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: TOM WATSON AT IBM">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="TOM_WATSON_AT_IBM" id="TOM_WATSON_AT_IBM"></a></p>
<h3>TOM WATSON AT IBM</h3>
<p>Inevitably, though, in 1937 he did join IBM, and just as inevitably he was an outstanding success. He immediately was voted class president at IBM trainee school; though I (and he) could not conceive of any trainee, in the climate of that period, even considering voting for anyone else! He achieved this position despite the fact that he drank openly (a fault that would have resulted in a severe admonition, if not even instant dismissal, for others). Indeed he reportedly had a drink 'problem' which was not fully resolved until the end of his wartime service. His younger brother, Dick, had such a problem throughout his life. No doubt amateur psychologists would read into these problems a reflection of their strict upbringing; but any such problems as did exist were not of importance in the context of both their enormous contributions to IBM.</p>
<p>Both sons served in the forces during the Second World War, Dick (dropping out of Yale) as a Major in Ordnance and Tom Jr as a pilot, a Lieutenant Colonel chauffeuring top brass around the USSR. Tom Jr later admitted to journalists that the one career he really would have liked to follow was that of an airline pilot. Running IBM, which was then already a future mapped out for him, came a poor second best!</p>
<p>After the war Dick (at the insistence of his father) returned to Yale to study languages - recording a better academic performance than his brother - not joining IBM until 1948. Tom Jr in the meantime began his training, his grooming for stardom, in IBM; returning to the company at the beginning of 1946. He was then assistant to Charles A Kirk - who he saw as a competitor - but Tom Jr. was, even so, promoted to be a Vice President just six months later and was promoted to the board just four months after that, while Kirk unexpectedly died soon after, in 1947. Continuing to make record progress, he become Executive Vice-President in 1949!</p>
<p>This training programme was to take him, over the next 5 years, through many of IBM's operating groups. Tom Jr himself believed that of all the influences on him during this period the most important was Al Williams, a Chartered Accountant (CPA) who became president of IBM in 1961; it was Al Williams who said of IBM "It is not bigness we seek, it is greatness. Bigness is imposing. Greatness is enduring..."</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: THE ADVENT OF COMPUTING">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="THE_ADVENT_OF_COMPUTING" id="THE_ADVENT_OF_COMPUTING"></a></p>
<h2>THE ADVENT OF COMPUTING</h2>
<p>Tom Watson Jr's influence was first felt in IBM's move to computing. It is true that his father also fully recognised the importance of the emerging computers and was enthusiastic about them. As reported for instance in Tom Jr's autobiography, his father came back from a visit to a computer laboratory at Columbia University saying " You ought to go up there and see that. I don't know what it was, but the fellow was doing it two hundred thousand times a second!" Even so, it was Tom Jr, however, who had the foresight to put in place the engineers needed to develop the experimental 701 programme, and who initiated the crash programme to further develop this into the 702 version as a true commercial computer. This was a courageous decision, requiring a substantial investment (the first of a number of such investments that were needed as IBM computer generation succeeded generation). For the first time in three decades retained profits would not suffice. IBM would have to sell bonds, placing the company deeper in debt than ever before. This was at a time when the market for computers was anything but obvious; and some observers thought it would be limited to a handful for use by government (no‑one else would surely be able to afford them or to find a suitable use for them!).</p>
<p>In his original book, Tom Watson Jr made it clear that almost everyone in IBM opposed his decision to invest in the development of computers. In particular, IBM's technical experts condemned it. Even the supporters of the new technology underestimated the potential. It was Cuthbert Hurd (brought in from the Oak Ridge laboratory of the Atomic Energy commission) who, rather than any of the Watsons made the famous prediction (optimistic for the time) that "…he could find customers for as many as thirty machines."[4] Yet that decision, and the single-minded way Tom Watson Jr fought to make it work, was the making of IBM. Thus, the commercial development of the computer, for which IBM will be remembered, was undoubtedly Tom Jr's great achievement.</p>
<p>Behind this decision was another one, that of spending more on R &amp; D. Al Williams had pointed out to Tom Jr that IBM was only spending 3% on R &amp; D when other high technology companies were spending between 6% and 9%. Tom Jr learnt the lesson, and thereafter - at least until the 1990s (when, even then, Gerstner only dropped it to 6%) - IBM consistently spent 9%. For comparison, the equivalent figure for Japan was 5.1%, though its high technology companies exceeded even the IBM level ‑ with the 1983 spending for Canon being 14.6% and that for NEC being 13.0%.</p>
<p>Although the initiative, and as such much of the credit for the birth of the information revolution, must go to Tom Jr. considerable courage was also displayed by his then ageing father who, despite his long commitment to internal funding, backed his son to the hilt; reportedly with the words "It is harder to keep a business great than it is to build it".</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: IBM PRESIDENT">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="IBM_PRESIDENT" id="IBM_PRESIDENT"></a></p>
<h3>IBM PRESIDENT</h3>
<p>Tom Jr's position was regularised when he was made president in 1952, but the justification for his earlier decision did not come until 1954 when the first orders for the 702 were canvassed; and ultimately in 1956 when, after the launch of the more powerful 705 (which, again on Tom Jr's initiative, was developed in parallel with the 701/702), IBM regained the technological imperative from UNIVAC, and also regained its position as market leader in sales.</p>
<p>It should be noted, even so, that - until the late 1950s - it was the US Airforce SAGE computerised tracking system which accounted for more than half of IBM's computer sales. The company made little profit on these sales but, as Tom Jr. said in his autobiography "It enabled us to build highly automated factories ahead of anybody else, and to train thousands of new workers in electronics."</p>
<p>Tom Jr's decision was justified; in the longer term it redirected IBM to its later position dominating the computer market. Even in the short term it paid off; for revenues more than tripled in six years, from $214.9 million in 1950 to $734.3 million in 1956. This dramatic rate of growth almost matched the wartime years; a better than 30% compound growth rate that Tom Jr more or less maintained for the full twenty years of his leadership of IBM. It was a record that few business leaders can have matched, and even outshone that of his illustrious father.</p>
<p>Right through to 1955, despite the presence of his son, Thomas Senior still kept a firm grip on the reins. In his autobiography, Tom Jr. described the position of his father as "He wanted to make me head of IBM, but he didn't like sharing the limelight." Then, Tom Jr. took over effective control in a moment that, according to some reports, might have been worthy of a Hollywood business epic; though the formal handover took place a few months later. The occasion was the decision to sign the Consent Decree which was offered by the government after its latest anti-trust investigation. Thomas Senior resisted, for as a matter of principle he had never signed a Consent Decree; even when the alternative, in 1914, was possibly a jail sentence. His son was more of a pragmatist and saw that the Consent Decree, which sought to strip IBM of half its card-making capacity, was largely irrelevant where the future of the company was already in computers not cards. There was though another condition, that IBM had to sell machines outright as well as on lease, that was to have repercussions in the late 1960's when leasing companies recognised the financing loophole that it created.</p>
<p>According to the more dramatic version of the story, confirmed by Tom Jr himself, after having had a row with his father he called a cab and left to sign the Decree. While actually in court to sign the decree, in a touch that was worthy of the direction of Orson Welles, Tom Jr. received a note, delivered by messenger, from his father. It simply said;</p>

</pre>
<p>The father had finally handed the reins over to his son in one of the most elegant ways that business has recorded! Tom Watson Jr himself saw the moment not long afterwards when his father died, and left him alone to run IBM, as the most traumatic. In his words (from the opening sentence of his book, Father Son &amp; Co); "When my father died in 1956 - six weeks after making me head of IBM - I was the most frightened man in America. For ten years he had groomed me to succeed him, and I had been a young man in a hurry, eager to take over, cocky and impatient. Now, suddenly, I had the job - but what I didn't have was dad there to back me up".</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: DICK WATSON &amp; WORLD TRADE">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="DICK_WATSON_.26_WORLD_TRADE" id="DICK_WATSON_.26_WORLD_TRADE"></a></p>
<h2>DICK WATSON &amp; WORLD TRADE</h2>
<p>In 1949, six years earlier, Thomas Senior had resolved the dynastic problem of succession by his two sons in a truly imperial style. While the US Corporation, even now the backbone of IBM's business, was to become the personal fiefdom of the elder, the rest of the world, the newly formed World Trade, was to be the property of the younger son, Dick; thus protecting both their positions from sibling rivalry.</p>
<p>It is less easy to see the full impact of Dick's career than it is of his brother's; the person at the centre of the IBM web in Armonk always receives the credit for most of the gains. What is clear, however, is that World Trade grew immensely in stature under Dick Watson; and IBM became a true multinational.</p>
<p>International Time Recording had established an office in Paris as early as 1914. Over the next decades up to the Second World War CTR established further offices in a number of countries around the world, though the operations were still typically small in comparison with the US business. The war obviously destroyed this international side of IBM; though some companies proved immensely resistant to destruction. The Hungarian company, for example, survived the Nazi occupation, and indeed the subsequent Communist take-over; still as an independent company which was firmly part of IBM.</p>
<p>In the late 1940's the one obvious exception to IBM's world-wide coverage was the United Kingdom, together with its Commonwealth. In these areas the British Tabulating Company had an exclusive right to make and sell IBM products. With the arrival of Dick Watson at World Trade in 1949 negotiations were commenced to ensure that the whole (non-US) world was its oyster; and IBM eventually started to market for itself in the UK in 1951. The British Tabulating Company went on to become ICL, then one of IBM's lesser but not inconsiderable rivals. It too can claim to have been in effect founded by the Watsons, father and son!</p>
<p>Dick Watson's achievement was to weld the disparate companies into a global whole, which was World Trade; to become a genuinely equal partner with US Domestic (IBM's name for its US corporation). That philosophy later came of age with the development of the 360 range of computers, where World Trade shared as an equal; including, for the first time, the R &amp; D work. The World Trade of the 1990s, which was equal in size to IBM Domestic and just as profitable, became a full partner; though it has since been merged with it - and separate trading figures are no longer included in the annual report. Although subject to Armonk's directions it was to a degree autonomous and had its own manufacturing facilities for each of IBM's products; for the main products it had them in each of its regions.</p>
<p>Despite the international credentials of the Watsons, their successors have not all been so cosmopolitan. The potential problem of 'insularity' of subsequent Armonk management is best illustrated by the story told by a senior (IBM) European executive during the late 1970's. When he and his wife were attending a very impressive, and congenial, meeting hosted by a number of IBM main board members and their wives, he attempted to return the compliment by inviting one couple to a similar event in Europe. He was astonished to receive the reply, from the wife, that neither of them even possessed passports! The executive was supposedly John Akers - which may help explain some of his later problems in coming to terms with the world-wide IBM; though, to be fair, after that time he did travel the world extensively. The incident, on the other hand, highlights the very real achievement of Dick Watson - working against such an insular culture - in establishing World Trade as an equal partner within IBM.</p>
<p>Although Dick Watson was able to build World Trade in volume terms, he was not able to dramatically increase its true geographical spread; though that was never his stated intention. IBM would boast that it operates in most countries (though, since the cut-backs of the early 1990s, this is often now through agents and not the local offices IBM was previously so proud to maintain), but its volume business is still really confined to Europe (and even then to the 4 'major' countries; Germany, France, Italy and the UK) and Japan. Such concentration is inevitable in an industry whose customers have to be highly developed, both in a technical and financial sense. The third world is not, yet, a significant market for large computers.</p>

<p><a name="R.26D" id="R.26D"></a></p>
<h2>R&amp;D</h2>
<p>Of the two brothers, however, it was Tom Watson Jr. who, possibly unfairly, was seen to make the most obvious impact on IBM as a whole. As we have already seen, one of the greatest of these was his impact on the technology. Prior to his time IBM had been just about the best selling organisation in the world, with a reasonable range of products; for Thomas Senior had always insisted on sound products. Tom Jr, however, created and funded the research and development structure that is essential to modern high technology industry. It was under his supervision that the laboratories were built up, to a point where, in the late1980s, they contained a respectable number of Nobel Prize winners; and to the point where the R &amp; D function could stand on an equal footing with marketing, true to his original objective.</p>
<p>When Tom Jr started this process in 1949 IBM was reportedly two years behind its main competitor, UNIVAC. In the 1980's, it was arguably up to a decade ahead of anyone else; though its problems since seem to have destroyed much of its strength in this area. This was not so obvious to the outside world, because the new products still followed the conservative release pattern started in the 1920's (and pursued very profitably until recently). Despite the hype about 'pre-releasing' products which did not yet exist, only when the market was sufficiently developed, and a launch was financially justifiable, did IBM commit its marketing resources. In the labs though, thanks to Tom Jr, they were able to dream the dreams of decades hence; independent and untroubled by the commercial winds blowing elsewhere. It was an ideal environment for an industrial researcher, and a highly productive for IBM.</p>
<p>The first, sour, fruit of this was the STRETCH programme to develop a 'supercomputer' a hundred times more powerful than the 704; but still based on the vacuum tube. It failed, at a reported cost of $20 million. Although embarrassing in terms of the rumours that drifted to the outside world, it would not however be the last IBM computer series to be killed and the cost was small in IBM's terms; and the experience gained was invaluable. One of IBM's strengths was that - until the 1980s - it really did learn from experience. Most other companies are only too anxious to bury deep their embarrassing mistakes; and never use the invaluable information they have gained. IBM on the other hand made very good use of these particularly hard earned lessons. I cannot think of a single fiasco, and there had been quite a few in the history of IBM, that was not - in my time - used to learn lessons that have later returned a dividend many times over when incorporated in more successful plans and activities. So it was with STRETCH.</p>
<p>The three actual computer ranges that eventually emerged from 1958 onwards comprised the 7070 and 7090 (for large government business), the 1620 (for the scientific community) and the 1401 (for commercial use). Despite the fact that many observers believed that Tom Jr was frittering away the resources his father had built up, these new ranges were remarkably successful, doubling IBM's sales once more over the six years from 1958 ($1.17 billion) to 1964 ($2.31 billion), maintaining IBM's dramatic growth rate virtually undiminished at approaching 30% compound. The effect was that IBM had become independent of outside funding.</p>

<p><a name="ORGANIZATIONAL_STRUCTURES" id="ORGANIZATIONAL_STRUCTURES"></a></p>
<h2>ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURES</h2>
<p>Perhaps Tom Watson Jr's truly greatest (but largely unrecorded) contribution to IBM was in terms of organisational structure, as had his been his father's; for one new range of products, no matter how successful, carries a company for a few years only. This achievement was, however, less widely reported, and even less widely appreciated.</p>
<p>In 1956, in a move that later became a biannual event, he reorganised IBM on divisional lines, to give a decentralised organisation, with 5 major divisions (in the US). The new structure comprised;</p>
<pre>
     Field Engineering Division ‑ the most important grouping selling to (and servicing) commercial 
     customers. 
</pre>
<pre>
     Federal Systems Division ‑ selling to (and servicing) the special requirements of the US
     government (including, later, major involvement as sub‑contractors to the NASA space programme).
</pre>
<pre>
     Systems Manufacturing Division 
</pre>
<pre>
     Components Manufacturing Division
</pre>
<pre>
     Research Division 
</pre>
<p>In the wings, almost as also‑rans, were Electric Typewriter, IBM World Trade, Service Bureau Corporation and Supplies Division; as well as the Time Division (which was sold off two years later in 1958).</p>
<p>Tom Jr's own comment on the situation was "We had a superb sales organisation but lacked expert management organisation in almost everything else". He set out to rectify the lack and redirected IBM into an organised bureaucracy capable of absorbing the shocks of change; and indeed eventually designed to even create its own shock wave of change.</p>
<p>He also introduced the concept of line and staff. In his own words[5] "By the mid-50s just about every big corporation had adopted the so-called staff-and-line structure. It was modeled on military organizations going back to the Prussian army in Napoleonic times."</p>

<p><a name="MANAGEMENT_BY_OBJECTIVES.28MBO.29" id="MANAGEMENT_BY_OBJECTIVES.28MBO.29"></a></p>
<h3>MANAGEMENT BY OBJECTIVES(MBO)</h3>
<p>Somewhat ahead of his time, for MBO was very much the flavor of the 1960s to come, the other great strength of his reorganization was that, again in Tom Watson's own words[6] "…it provided IBM executives with the clearest possible goals. Each operating man was judged strictly on his unit's results, and each staff man on his effort toward making IBM the world leader in his specialty."</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: ARMONK">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="ARMONK" id="ARMONK"></a></p>
<h2>ARMONK</h2>
<p>Perhaps the final element of formal organisational change was the isolation of headquarters staff in Armonk, in up‑state New York. This was said by him to be in order to be near his family. He lived close by in Connecticut, where taxes were lower; but kept his staff across the border in New York State so, it has been suggested, that IBM would not be seen as similarly evading taxes! Cynics have indeed said it was his fear of nuclear warfare (he was the owner of a fall‑out shelter). I suspect that such cynical views miss the point, for (whatever the reason) the physical separation of Armonk, I believe, contributed to subsequent senior management's ability to survey the world IBM scene more dispassionately; a degree of detachment that it used to particularly good effect in its strategic planning. This was the case, at least, until the 1980s when Armonk's isolation may have worked against the interests of IBM, by reinforcing the problems of 'groupthink' which then seemed to emerge.</p>
<p>IBM chose to isolate its senior management geographically, which is a particularly effective approach, but I have also worked with a third world government which just as effectively stopped the lobbyists from obtaining access to its council of ministers in the capital by cultural means!</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: RESPECT FOR THE INDIVIDUAL">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="RESPECT_FOR_THE_INDIVIDUAL" id="RESPECT_FOR_THE_INDIVIDUAL"></a></p>
<h2>RESPECT FOR THE INDIVIDUAL</h2>
<p>Perhaps his most important organisational contribution was, however, in the area of ideology.</p>
<p>He had a very clear moral and ethical sense, just as strong as his father's but more in line with the twentieth century. He extended the IBM practice of protecting its employees, even though they were already protected and preserved under the philosophy that 'people' were IBM's finest asset. The Open Door policy (which we will see later in the chapter on Human Resource Management) originally started by his father was continued, but he introduced a whole series of new programmes that added up to IBM's 'Respect for the Individual', which was at the core of its later personnel policies; described at some length later in this book. For the first time he directed managers to hire Negroes and members of minority groups to every extent possible. He was a liberal, in a liberal era; following the tradition set by his father he promoted the careers of the Kennedys (and as with his father's experience, this still did not protect IBM from the inevitable anti‑trust suit!).</p>
<p>He was also a disciple of individualism, and this led to the 'controlled anarchy' which was , I believe, at the heart of IBM's continuing success (though I doubt he would have subscribed to the description of 'anarchy'!); and which was one of the casualties of the failing IBM. He deliberately set out to destroy the patriarchal worship and evangelising that was a feature of his father's reign. He had all the IBM song books banned, and indeed destroyed; so that those illicit copies that survived had a rarity value when allowed back in again a decade later! He was even seen wearing a striped shirt; the foundations of the old IBM really were being rocked!</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: &quot;WILD DUCK&quot;">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name=".22WILD_DUCK.22"></a></p>
<h3>"WILD DUCK"</h3>
<p>At the heart of this philosophy was the 'wild duck'. In the 1950's Tom Jr. (or perhaps one of his speech writers) had read a fable in one of Kierkegaard's books (not Ibsen, as reported by a number of writers, but still surely the most unlikely of models for a modern multinational!). In the fable, which is also featured in Tom Watson Jr's own first book (A Business and Its Beliefs), but which - interestingly - is not even mentioned in his later autobiography, some villagers took pity on wild ducks flying south and fed them with corn. Unfortunately those that became tame and depended on the corn didn't continue south and died in the winter; only those which remained wild were able to continue their flight south. The moral was that it is easy to tame a wild duck, but impossible to return a tame duck to the wild. Tom Jr genuinely believed in a cult of individualism, and could express real contempt for what he saw as conformity.</p>
<p>Promoting the message of the 'wild duck' at every opportunity he said "As you stand up and are counted you will first run into the group who equate newness with wrongness....Second you're sure to meet cynics, people who believe anyone who sticks his neck out is a fool....Follow the path of the unsafe independent thinker....Speak your mind and fear less the label of crackpot than the stigma of conformity".</p>
<p>It was heady stuff for any large corporation; and particularly for one of the calibre of IBM.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: BELIEFS">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="BELIEFS" id="BELIEFS"></a></p>
<h2>BELIEFS</h2>
<p>He took the beliefs sufficiently seriously to incorporate them in 1962 in 'Principles and Beliefs' in the McKinsey Foundation Lecture Series; published in 1963 by McGraw Hill under the title 'A Business and its Beliefs. The Ideas that Helped Build IBM'.</p>
<p>In it he said that he believed a corporation like IBM "...owes its resiliency not to its form of organisation or administrative skills, but to the power of what we call beliefs and the appeal these beliefs have for its people.....In other words the basic philosophy, spirit and drive of an organisation have far more to do with its relative achievements than do technological or economic resources, organisational structure, innovation and timing.....IBM is still very much the company it has always been and what we intend it always shall be. For while everything else has altered, our beliefs remain unchanged."</p>
<p>Such philosophical, indeed near religious, thoughts were seen by most IBM watchers as hypocritical nonsense. William Rodgers in 'THINK', for example, dismisses them as "While Tom railed against conformity IBM enforced, it was a clear example of an intellectual, or perhaps emotional, disposition to honour what corporate policy stifled". An old colleague of Tom Jr was found who said "Tom doesn't believe it; he probably just wishes it was true. Life would be simpler and better that way. And who wouldn't like that?"</p>
<p>Undoubtedly there was an element of hope outstripping experience in his pronouncements. Equally, I imagine, a number of IBM's more die‑hard managers merely paid lip‑service to the new climate, but otherwise continued to enforce conformity in their ranks.</p>
<p>But ultimately, I believe, the cynics were wrong to dismiss all the evidence offered by Tom Jr's many pronouncements across more than a decade and a half. It was no temporary fad and a prolonged 'climate', promoted (and indeed enforced) over such a long period by as strong a manager as undoubtedly was Tom Watson Jr, has to have some significant impact The evidence in the later IBM - at least until the later 1980s - indicated that Tom Jr's efforts were not wasted and he succeeded in his ambition.</p>
<p>Mind you TJW Jr. was especially lucky in that the ethical nature of IBM that he promoted, paradoxically, was strongly reinforced by the (anti-trust) threats of the US Justice Department!</p>
<p>Rather strangely, in view of his preoccupation with these philosophies whilst running IBM, they do not feature strongly in his auto-biography; which stresses the more conventional elements of his reign! Perhaps the pressure to conform eventually effects the most adventurous of managers!</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: PERSONNEL POLICIES">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="PERSONNEL_POLICIES" id="PERSONNEL_POLICIES"></a></p>
<h3>PERSONNEL POLICIES</h3>
<p>While, the apex of the pyramid, global control was exercised by a very small group of people, the Central Management Committee (CMC) located at Armonk, at the other were the 400,000 or so workers at the "sharp end", whose implementation of the policies was never been less than impecc­able.</p>
<p>Recruitment…as with any company, and particularly with a Theory Z company, the greatest strength of IBM ultimately was the outstanding quality of the latter group. IBM was able to, and often did, employ as "workers" people who would qualify as directors in many other organisations; and could afford to pay them as such. The quality was evidenced by the number of graduates in the workforce. In the UK, for example, even in 1982 they accounted for 30% of the total workforce, where only 27% of it had less than 5 "O" levels. This was just one indicator though; for IBM, as an avowedly "single status" company, held no special brief for grad­uates, and the figure was merely a reflection of the quality of its recruits in general. It was reported that IBM then received in excess of 100 applications for each job it sought to fill from outside the company - the sort of ratio which Microsoft now enjoys instead! Natura­lly it could choose the cream, and it could even afford to indulge the most idiosyncratic choices of its managers without seriously diluting the overall quality. The Japanese corporations were in the same fortunate position.</p>
<p>To reach even the stage of the first interview they had to show a sound employment track record. They would, of course, have had to demonstrate the degree of charm that is an essential prerequisite to passing through a number of such interviews, whatever the company doing the recruiting. Despite Buck Rodgers' claim that "only first‑line managers do the actual hiring in IBM", in practice a whole range of staff and management (usually including relatively senior management if it was sales‑force recruitment) interviewed potential recruits; IBM took the process very seriously. There was, however, one relatively unique requirement that, with very few exceptions, they had to meet and that was passing an aptitude test. In theory this merely ensured a minimal numerate ability, in order that they may be able to understand the complexi­ties of computing. In practice it was really a rigorous intel­ligence test that ensured that all key personnel entering IBM had a high intellectual capabil­ity. IBM was just as prone as any other company to recruit its staff on the basis of the rationalized intuit­ive hunches of its managers but, despite this, the aptitude test ensured that in the end the odds were heavily weighted in IBM's favor; in terms of achieving a high caliber of personnel, even when afflicted by the worst vagaries of the recruitment process. The benefit of this one simple screening should not be underestimated as a contributor to the undoubt­ed high quality of the key personnel within IBM.</p>
<p>It is interesting to note that Tom Watson Jr claimed that 'The part of my work I loved best was picking and choosing men.' Once again, the lead came from the top.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: TRAINING">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="TRAINING" id="TRAINING"></a></p>
<h3>TRAINING</h3>
<p>Having recruited the highest caliber of personnel IBM then trained, and retrained, them. It was recognized that all personnel new to IBM must receive suitable induction train­ing no matter what their job. This was no new fad, for one of the very first things T J Watson estab­lished on arriving at IBM (then still CTR) were training schools for its staff; and in particular for its salesmen. The one year plus that this training took for field personnel was just one extreme version of this. It was recognized, in addition, that staff training was an ongoing commitment and all staff were expected to attend regular courses, adding up to an average of 5% of overall staff time and typically as much as a month a year in the case of the field force. At its peak, during 1984, internal education cost IBM some $600 million in direct costs alone.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: THE CULT OF INDIVIDUALISM">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="THE_CULT_OF_INDIVIDUALISM" id="THE_CULT_OF_INDIVIDUALISM"></a></p>
<h2>THE CULT OF INDIVIDUALISM</h2>
<p>The Cult of Individualism…by the end of the 1970s IBM had, over its three quarters of a century of existence, deve­loped a resource of some 400,000 very high caliber and especially well trained personnel. The final element in the structure that then maximized the effective use of this resource was a commitment to delegation, to the maximum degree poss­ible, at all levels. This came about mainly as a result of the caliber of personnel involved, since they were independent minded enough not to settle for anything less. It was, though, also enshrined in IBM's personnel policies. Every employee had, as of right, the maximum delegated responsibility and authority for his or her own particular func­tion. To a degree in theory, and to a large extent in prac­tice, management was asked first to provide support for the individual rather than control them. Thomas J Watson's approach was reported by his son: "Dad always preached the idea that executives and managers should see themselves not as bosses of employees but as their 'assistants'."</p>
<p>Following this lead, IBM had to a very large degree managed to break down its operations into cells that could be auton­omously run by one individual. This reached its peak in the field force where the sales-person was uniquely responsible for all IBM's activities affecting their customers. He or she was the single point of contact co-ordinating the many facets of IBM's activities, and they carried the prime responsibility for ensuring that the customers needs were suit­ably met, and sales accordingly maximized; IBM's policies usually had a secure basis in pragmatic self‑interest. More important was that he or she was also given the comparable authority to guarantee that all this could happen. Perhaps uniquely among most industrial companies they were given the privilege of deciding the best policy for his customers, even if nece­ssary over their own management's views. They had the right to set such policy, and management had to have their agreement to any changes; though it has to be admitted that it was a brave, or foolish, individual who risked their career by insisting on their rights in this way. Yet again, the field force was but an extreme example of the general degree of delegation that applied throughout IBM. Once more the position since that time was confused, but sales force delegation probably is less well practiced - not least because it is now difficult to control the overlap of responsibilities with dealers and agents.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: HORIZONTAL COMMUNICATIONS">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="HORIZONTAL_COMMUNICATIONS" id="HORIZONTAL_COMMUNICATIONS"></a></p>
<h3>HORIZONTAL COMMUNICATIONS</h3>
<p>The difficulties inherent in any attempt to manage such anarchy are obvious. IBM's formal response might have been in the first instance to deny the merest possi­bility of any anarchy; and then to point out that it employed a very high ratio of management to staff; it aimed to have no more than seven staff reporting to a manager, to guarantee effective personnel management - the level that it is, now, accepted is necessary to manage 'professionals' working on non-routine tasks. There was indeed at least an intention to this effect and, albeit to a lesser extent than claimed by IBM, such a massive investment in management must always have had some practical impact. Recently, with the emphasis on traditional management theory, this might even have become the main mode of management. At its peak, however, more important (though unrecognized by many in IBM) were the very strong cultural factors that encouraged co-operation between the many disparate frag­ments of the organisation. For it was the horizontal communication, between individuals at the workface, that was IBM's particular strength. It may also be a strength of Microsoft; but for the very different reason that it has far fewer staff, spread across fewer 'disciplines' and limited to one main campus - so there is nothing to stop you talking face to face with anyone else!</p>
<p>Despite is global structure, the degree of horizontal communication in IBM was indeed very high and, although the inevitable political games were played, these were less likely to be the most debilitating "zero‑sum" confrontations. At the heart of the unusual willingness to co-oper­ate was a degree of individual security and self confidence, based, most notably, on 'lifetime employment'; one reason why the later revoking of this caused such catastrophic long-term effects! This also reflected on the one hand the caliber of the individuals, and their secure grasp of their own speciality, and on the other the widely recognized rights of the individ­ual to be respon­sible for his or her own special territory; unthreatened by incursions from others. From this strong position it was easy for individuals to build the communication links that were essential to make their part of the organisation work.</p>
<p>This cross boundary communication was made easier because inter‑departmental taboos were largely absent, once more partly as a result of the culture. In addition it was, at least in part, a result of the "single status" policy, which tended to break down the barriers between management and the other ranks to a much greater degree than in other companies. An IBM manager was seen in some respects as just another specialist. In the main though it was a func­tion of the personnel recruited, who tended to be good communicators with a natural desire to communicate with others.</p>
<p>The main communication within IBM, therefore, was horizontal between; peers. This was tacitly recognized, and encouraged, by each individual having their own terminal linked into a world-wide network, even in the early 1980s. On this network the individual even then could communicate at electronic speed with any other individ­ual in the organisation. Interestingly, long before the widespread acceptance of email, the IBM experience showed that it was this person to person communic­ation that was the main currency of such a network, rather than the use of the large centralized databases that was then predicted by many information researchers. This horizontal communication, be it face to face or more frequently by tele­phone (or now increasingly through the Web), is another factor that still diff­erentiates IBM from many other companies. On paper the structure is the usual pyramid, but this hides the fact that the most important layer is at the bottom and horizontal; with the upper layers in many respects uninvolved in most of the day to day communications. Such one or two dimensional representation though does not do justice to the richness of peer group contacts of the average IBM'er.</p>

<p><a name="CORPORATE_MODESTY" id="CORPORATE_MODESTY"></a></p>
<h2>CORPORATE MODESTY</h2>
<p>Indeed, one element of philosophy that applied only to Armonk, but was - until the later CEOs began to believe their own propaganda - a critical factor of IBM's longevity as a dominant feature in the most volatile of markets, was an acute awareness of its own fallibility. This was derived from the Watsons. Tom Jr, for example, in 1974 revealed to a reporter that "The secret I learned early on from my father was to run scared and never think I had it made....I never felt I was completely adequate to the job and always ran scared...The fundamental for our (IBM) success was running scared. I've seen us go by companies whose chief executives used to make me shake in awe".</p>
