			<p><b>Illegal immigration to the United States</b> refers to the migration of people across the <a href="/wiki/Border.html" title="Border">national borders</a> of the <a href="/wiki/United_States.html" title="United States">United States</a> that is in violation of U.S. <a href="/wiki/Immigration_law.html" title="Immigration law">immigration</a> and <a href="/wiki/United_States_nationality_law.html" title="United States nationality law">nationality law</a>. The terms <i>illegal alien, illegal immigrant, undocumented alien, undocumented immigrant</i>, and <i>undocumented worker</i>, are common terms used to refer to persons residing in the United States without either U.S. <a href="/wiki/Citizenship.html" title="Citizenship">citizenship</a> or a valid immigration status. <sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a  title="">[1]</a></sup>. In the United States the term ‘’undocumented alien’’ typically refers to a foreign national who entered the country without valid travel documents or who overstayed the limited period of time granted upon entry. For example, a tourist who enters with a valid [B1 visa] and is granted a stay of 15 days and remains in-country for 30 days is an ‘’undocumented alien’’. The holder of a valid B1 (tourist) visa is barred from accepting employment. By accepting employment this hypothetical tourist becomes an ‘’undocumented worker’’ (whether he is an ‘’undocumented alien’’ or not). Technically, those who do not work are not "undocumented workers"; however, the term is often used to encompass all unauthorized individuals, including children, the elderly, and those who cannot or do not work.</p>

<h3>Illegal immigration overview</h3>
<p>According to a 2002 Zogby International poll, "58 percent of Mexicans agree with the statement, "The territory of the United States' southwest rightfully belongs to Mexico." Zogby said 28 percent disagreed, while another 14 percent said they weren't sure. Meanwhile, a similar number – 57 percent – agreed that "Mexicans should have the right to enter the U.S. without U.S. permission," while 35 percent disagreed and 7 percent were unsure. " <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=27941">[4]</a> In the 2001-2006 National Development Plan the <a href="/wiki/Politics_of_Mexico.html" title="Politics of Mexico">Mexican Government</a> says they want to support the 18 million Mexicans who live outside Mexico. There is no information on this report on the source of the data or on the number of those immigrants living in the United States<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a  title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Welfare reform stimulated no mass exodus of unauthorized migrants, and there was no let-up in the massive wave of new immigration occurring in the second half of the 1990s. Despite over 60% of the American public claiming they want to curb illegal immigration Congress is unable to agree on doing anything.</p>
<p>Professor Wayne A. Cornelius, (U.C. Davis) summed up the problems of illegal <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://polisci.ucsd.edu/faculty/cornelius.htm">[5]</a> U. S, immigration <a  class="external text" title="http://www.cri.uci.edu/pdf/JEMS--final.pdf">(Controlling ‘Unwanted’ Immigration)</a> “Consequences predicted by advocates of the concentrated border enforcement strategy have not yet materialized: there is no evidence that unauthorized migration is being deterred at the point of origin; that would-be illegal entrants are being discouraged at the border after multiple apprehensions by the Border Patrol and returning home; that their employment prospects in the US have been curtailed; or that the resident population of undocumented immigrants is shrinking”</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Size of illegal immigrant population">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Size_of_illegal_immigrant_population" id="Size_of_illegal_immigrant_population"></a></p>
<h3>Size of illegal immigrant population</h3>
<p>The actual number of illegal immigrants is uncertain because of the difficulty of actually counting illegal immigrants who often do not want to be counted. There are no national surveys, administrative data, or other sources of information that directly provide accurate estimates of this population<a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.csmonitor.com/2006/0516/p01s02-ussc.html">[6]</a><sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a  title="">[3]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Investigative journalists Donald L. Barlett and James B. Steele, state in Time magazine in its September 12, 2004 issue, "It's fair to estimate, based on a Time magazine investigation, that the number of illegal aliens flooding into the U.S. this year will total 3 million/year - enough to fill 22,000 Boeing 737-700 airliners, or 60 flights every day for a year."<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a  title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>One method of estimating this population is called the “residual methodology” where the reported census number of self proclaimed foreign born people in the U.S. census is subtracted from the known number of legal immigrants to obtain the illegal immigrant (residual) population<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a  title="">[5]</a></sup>. This methodology is used by the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Homeland_Security.html" title="United States Department of Homeland Security">US Department of Homeland Security</a>, <a href="/wiki/Pew_Hispanic_Center.html" title="Pew Hispanic Center">Pew Hispanic Center</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Census_Bureau.html" title="Census Bureau">Census Bureau</a> and others. Since illegal immigrants have many reasons for not answering the census correctly and no penalties for answering the census incorrectly a direct subtraction has a well known source of under count error and has to be corrected. All known users of this methodology correct the foreign born population (~ 35-50 million) by 10-40% (3-12 million) to account for this under count effect. Critics claim this correction is in error--whatever size correction is used.</p>
<p>Using the residual methodology with a minimal 10% foreign born undercount correction (reason for correction size unstated) for the 2000 Census and a 700,000 net illegal immigrant increase/year assumption and data from the March 2004 Current Population Survey [CPS Survey] (U.S. Census Bureau and Department of Labor) Pew came up with 10.3 million illegal immigrants in 2004. Assuming the same rate of growth Pew estimates this population reached at least 11 million as of March 2005 <sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a  title="">[6]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The Pew Hispanic Center <a  class="external text" title="http://pewhispanic.org/files/reports/44.pdf">(Estimating the Size and Characteristics of the Undocumented Population; Figure 3)</a> estimates that in the 1980’s net illegal immigration was at the 130,000 per year increasing to 450,000 /year from 1990-94, and further increasing to 750,000 /year from 1995-1999 and staying at 700-850,000+ /year since about 2000. Illegal Mexican immigration amounts to about 500,000 /year of this influx since about 1999. According to the same <a href="/wiki/Pew_Hispanic_Center.html" title="Pew Hispanic Center">Pew Hispanic Center</a> study as of March 2005, the illegal immigrant population had reached 11 million or more including more than 6.5 million illegal Mexicans (~60% of all illegals). Assuming the same rate of growth as in recent years gives about 12,000,000 illegal immigrants in the United States as of January 2006, increasing at 700-850,000 per year with illegal Mexicans amounting to about 60%+ (~7+ million) of the total by 2006 and an ever increasing percentage as time progresses. By September 2006 the illegal population is thought to be about 13 million. About one-sixth of the illegal immigrant population--about 2.0 million people--is under 18 years of age.</p>
<p>The number of Mexican immigrants legal and illegal in the United States has grown quite rapidly over the past 35 years, increasing almost 15-fold from about 760,000 in the 1970 Census to more than 11 million in 2004—an average annual growth rate of more than 8 percent, maintained over more than 3 decades. This remarkable growth has been largely driven by illegal immigration. On average the net Mexican population living in the United States has grown by at least a half million people a year over the past decade. About 80 to 85 percent of the immigration from Mexico and Central America in recent years has been illegal. <a  class="external text" title="http://pewhispanic.org/files/reports/44.pdf">(Pew report Figure 4 and page 2)</a></p>
<p>After 2000 the estimation of the growth of the illegal population becomes more difficult because of a lack of good information. The rate of growth of the illegal population is estimated with the Consumer Price Survey data [2004] which suffers from the same under counting problems of the Census plus the problem of a much smaller statistical sample used of only 10-20,000. Its accuracy may well be suspect for lack of a truly representative "random" sample and well known non-random distribution of the illegal populations. Using these techniques Pew comes up with from 12+ million illegal immigrants in January 2006 with a estimated growth rate of 700,000 to 850,000 net illegal immigrants per year . This is the so called "consensus" number used by most reporters. The unstated cumulative error in total illegal immigrants by 2006 could easily be an additional 8 million illegal immigrants or more and the error in the growth rate since 2000 could also be very large but again is unstated by Pew and others. There is a high probability of the illegal immigrant population's size in 2006 being significantly larger than the 12 million predicted as all additional information points to a significant increase (300+ %) in illegal immigration rates after 2000 not a reduction as initially predicted by Pew.</p>
<p>In 2006 legal immigrants to the United States now number approximately 1,000,000 legal immigrants per year of which about 600,000 are Change of Status immigrants who already are in the U.S. Legal immigrants to the United States are now at their highest level ever at over 35,000,000. Net Illegal immigration has also soared from about 130,000 per year in the 1970's, to 300,000+ per year in the 1980's to over 500,000 per year in the 1990's to over 700,000 per year in the 2000's. Total illegal immigration may be as high as 1,500,000 per year [in 2006] with a net of at least 700,000 more illegal immigrants arriving each year to join the 12,000,000 to 20,000,000 that are already here. (Pew Hispanic Data Estimates<a  class="external autonumber" title="http://pewhispanic.org/files/reports/44.pdf">[7]</a>, <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.city-journal.org/html/16_3_immigrants_economy.html">[8]</a>)</p>
<p><br />
The Office of Immigration Statistics in the Department of Homeland Security using U.S. Census estimates (that nearly all researchers believe are too low) that 10.5 million illegal immigrants were living in the United States in January 2005 and that the number grew at a national average of 408,000 a year. Every time they have revised their numbers it is to a significantly higher estimate.</p>

They made the assumption that the amount of <a href="/wiki/Remittances.html" title="Remittances">remittances</a> (money sent back to Mexico) is directly proportional to the number of Mexican immigrants in the United States. Other data used for their estimates are the increases of households and school enrollment in Mexican immigrant communities. They conclude that the number of illegal immigrants in the United States may well be twice the official number put out by the U.S. Census of 9 million and may be 20 million people or higher. Information from <a href="/wiki/Banco_de_Mexico.html" title="Banco de Mexico">The Mexican Central Bank</a> and (U.S. Federal Reserve Banks) details the remittances and shows their growth <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://siteresources.worldbank.org/EXTPAYMENTREMMITTANCE/Resources/BancodeMexicoRicardoMedina.pdf">[12]</a>. According to that data, remittances stayed fairly stable until 2000 when a steady and dramatic increase began. The change in remittances between 1998 and 1999 is most likely a problem in accounting — the two year average is still about 450 thousand consistent with other data. The agreement with the Pew estimate is reasonably good up to 2001 where there is a significant difference — just where the Pew and Census data becomes harder to extrapolate because of lack of good data. Using this technique Bear Sterns investigators come up with a possible illegal population of 20 million or greater. (See figure for calculation) Other data confirming their estimates are the dramatic increases of households and school enrollment in Mexican immigrant communities (read their report for more details). Border Arrest data do not show this dramatic increase in apprehensions, so how could all these new illegal immigrants have gotten here? A possible answer is simple — many of them simply drove to the United States on shopping trips that included new jobs and a new home and "forgot" to return to Mexico. According to the Bureau and Transportation statistics [<a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bts.gov/programs/international/border_crossing_entry_data/us_mexico/index.html">[13]</a>there are over 200,000,000 "legal" border crossing from Mexico each year, ~80% by automobile. If only one percent kept on going plus the numbers that walk across the border and its easy to get the number of illegal immigrants projected and the lack of interior enforcement says they have a good chance of getting away with it.</p>
<p>The number of illegal immigrants emigrating [leaving] the U.S. is estimated at about 240,000 /year (~20% of illegal population) <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cbo.gov/showdoc.cfm?index=6019&amp;sequence=0#box2">[14]</a></p>

<p>That Pew Hispanic article goes on to state, "The rest of the unauthorized migrant population, somewhat more than half, entred the country illegally. Some evaded customs and immigration inspectors at ports of entry by hiding in vehicles such as cargo trucks. Others tracked through the Arizona desert, waded across the Rio Grande or otherwise eluded the U.S. Border patrol which has jurisdiction over all the land areas away from the ports of entry on the borders with Mexico and Canada." <a  class="external text" title="http://pewhispanic.org/files/factsheets/19.pdf">Available online (PDF)</a> meaning that they crossed a border without passing possible criminal or health inspection or having a valid passport and <a href="/wiki/Visa_%28document%29.html" title="Visa (document)">visa</a> inspected by an immigration officer at a Port of Entry (POE).

The main effect has been to drive illegal immigration to less well defended parts of the border and drive the cost of illegal immigration up as more and more illegal immigrants employ expensive “Coyotes” and their criminal associates. Some of the traffic has spread away from the dangerous Tucson districts deserts where over a hundred illegal immigrants have died so far this year compared to 153 in 2005. <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.signonsandiego.com/uniontrib/20060722/images/border.pdf">[22]</a> In 2006 the number of apprehensions on the border is almost the same as last year through 16 July 2006 at 936,000 <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/mexico/tijuana/20060722-9999-1n22crossers.html">[23]</a>. However, according to many US Border Patrol agents, they were instructed by their leadership to "keep new arrests to an "absolute minimum" to offset the effect of the Minuteman vigil, adding that patrols along the border have been severely limited" as one US Border Patrol agent put it <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.washtimes.com/national/20050513-122032-5055r.htm">[24]</a>.</p>
<p>Each state in the United States has a <a href="/wiki/United_States_National_Guard.html" title="United States National Guard">National Guard</a> organization that could, in principal, be placed on the border at a state governor's discretion to assist with border security; many states also have a backup to the National Gurard called the <a href="/wiki/State_Defense_Force.html" title="State Defense Force">State Defense Force</a> that could, in an emergency, also be activated for this purpose. Arizona and New Mexico have currently declared the counties that border <a href="/wiki/Mexico.html" title="Mexico">Mexico</a> to be under serious duress caused by uncontrolled illegal immigrant traffic, thereby enabling governors to deploy National Guardsmen to the international border. Arizona has exercised this option but New Mexico has not.</p>
<p>In an article published by Renew America, a website which defines itself as a "Alan Keyes' website for grassroots activism -- designed to foster a nationwide movement to restore America to its founding ideals", former US Border Patrol Supervisor David Stoddard asserts that "The whole U.S.-Mexico border could be sealed with as few as 100 helicopters equipped with FLIR (forward looking infrared) scopes, and a few hundred men equipped with state of the art sensors, scopes and other electronics..." <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.renewamerica.us/columns/zieve/060713">[25]</a></p>
<p>In 2006 the Senate approved 370 miles of new double- and triple-layered fencing and 500 miles of vehicle barriers and then refused to fund them. In December, the House voted for 700 miles of new barriers. Neither was able to reach a compromise bill. There is no assurance that if built, these new layers of protection will reduce the flow of illegal migrants from Mexico.</p>
<p>It is estimated that over a million people cross the border illegally each year, most of whom are of Mexican origin{fact}. The rest are labeled "Other Than Mexicans" (OTM), of whom a majority are <a href="/wiki/Central_America.html" title="Central America">Central Americans</a>{fact}.</p>

<p>Immigrants from nations that do not have automatic visa agreements, or who would not otherwise qualify for a visa, sometimes cross the borders illegally.

<h4>Visa or Border Crossing Card overstayers</h4>
<p>A visa overstayer is someone who has entered the United States legally and then illegally overstayed his or her visa or violated the restrictions on Border Crossing Card (BCC) or laser visa. Fraudulent and forged visa and BCC passes are included in this category. An estimated average 40-60% of all illegal immigrants to the U.S. entered this way. The number of overstayers varies considerably from country to country depending on the location of the country, the cultural, political, social and economic conditions in a given country in a given time. The PEW Hispanic institute reported <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://pewhispanic.org/files/factsheets/19.pdf">[28]</a> that the INS had developed statistics that showed 3.2% of all Central and South America visas are overstayed. A U.S. General Accounting Office (GAO) study gives estimates for all countries showing that China, India, Korea, and the Philippines had violation rates as high as 8%.<a  class="external autonumber" title="http://tinet.ita.doc.gov/view/f-2004-201-001/index.html">[29]</a> In general the poorer the country they came from the more likely the foreign visitor was to violate their visa.</p>
<p>GAO estimated that 40-60% of all Mexican illegal immigrants got here by violating their border crossing document's conditions. <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d04170t.pdf">[30]</a> In operation Tarmac where ICE and DHS checked airport employees for legal employment they found 27% of the over 4900 violators found were visa or BCC violators. In one of the rare ICE check ups on a grocery chain they found that over 57% of the several hundred violators were visa overstayers or BCC violators (<a  class="external text" title="http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d04170t.pdf|">Overstay Tracking Is a Key Component of a Layered Defense</a>) patrol officials believe Visa violator numbers would increase if it became more difficult to illegally sneak across the border as illegal border crossers switched techniques. About 33% of all Central American illegal immigrants came by overstaying their visa with the rest traveling through Mexico to reach the border and then crossing illegally. At lest 95+% of all illegal South American, European, and Asians got here by overstaying their visa. (The other ~5% represent illegal immigrants smuggled by ship or plane) An increasing number of illegal immigrants are now flying to Mexico or Canada and then crossing the border illegally by foot or car. The ICE agents on the border report a 52% increase in border violators caught that are Other Than Mexican (OTM). The two main sources of illegal visa violators are Mexico and Canada which the U.S. has a large amount of cross border traffic with. Other estimates done by the GAO show that the overstayers and BCC violators from Mexico alone in the year 2001 may exceed 2,000,000 /year. <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d04170t.pdf">[31]</a> The Bureau of Transportation Statistics <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bts.gov/programs/international/border_crossing_entry_data/us_mexico/index.html">[32]</a> reported that in 2003 (the last year of available statistics) there were 79,000,000 and 245,000,000 border crossings between Canada and Mexico respectively and the US. The tourist bureau shows that there were less Mexicans (as reported by their government) doing all this traffic than their were Canadians (as reported by their government).<a  class="external autonumber" title="http://tinet.ita.doc.gov/view/f-2004-201-001/index.html">[33]</a> Mexico has roughly three times the population of Canada. The latest ICE statistics show that they captured 30,000 Brazilians after they crossed the U.S. Mexican border illegally for the first time in 2004. Two of the terrorists behind the <a href="/wiki/September_11%2C_2001_attacks.html" title="September 11, 2001 attacks">September 11, 2001 attacks</a> were visa overstayers. The federal government historically has not extensibly checked up on visa holders once they are in the country; but visa checks has been used extensively after 9 September 2001 to check up on illegal immigrants from countries with large populations sympathic to terrorists. Several hundred visa violators were deported and several thousand more left voluntarily rather than face deportation hearings. <sup title="The text in the vicinity of this tag needs citation." class="noprint">[<a  title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><i>citation&#160;needed</i></a>]</sup></p>
<p>To help improve the lack of good information on visa overstayers the new US-VISIT program collects and retains biographic, travel, and biometric information, such as photographs and fingerprints, of foreign nationals seeking entry into the United States as well as requiring electronic readable passports containing this information. Information collected is checked against lookout databases to ensure that known or suspected terrorists, criminals, and previous U.S. immigration law violators are not admitted. <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.dhs.gov/interweb/assetlibrary/OIG_05-11_Feb05.pdf">[34]</a> and then checked against their eventual departure. US-VISIT entry procedures have been operational in the secondary inspection areas of the 50 busiest land border ports of entry since December 29, 2004, and are also in place at 115 airports and 15 seaports.<a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.dhs.gov/dhspublic/display?content=4858">[35]</a> Early in 2007 the DHS is hoping to replace the laser visa or boundary crossing cards with People Access Security Service (PASS) card, as a secure identity document for people traveling to or from Canada or Mexico. <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.thebta.org/syndicate/news/archives/cat_us-visit.html">[36]</a> These would include Radio Frequency Identification Data (RFID) for ease of transit and security.</p>
<p>Visa overstayers violators tend to be somewhat more educated and be better off financially than those who walked crossed the border illegally. <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.csmonitor.com/2002/0205/p01s03-usju.html">[37]</a> The financial and education status of the thousands of BCC or laser visa violators is unknown; but is probably very similar to the illegal border crossers who walked across since they both come from the same population base.</p>
<p>One common means of visa overstaying is coming to the U.S. on a student visa and not going to school or not leaving the country after finishing school. <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://ktla.trb.com/la-me-visa22may22,0,2677069.story?coll=ktla-home-3">[38]</a> The number of foreign students in the United States is over 600,000.</p>

<h2>Government Response</h2>
<p>Staffing levels and priorities of finding illegal employers clearly reflect the low priority assigned to workplace enforcement by the Immigration services. Since 1986 the United States has had legislation that penalizes employers who knowingly hire unauthorized foreign workers, but enforcement of employer sanctions has always been at a token level. The provision of the 1986 law that provides sanctions for ‘knowingly’ hiring unauthorized immigrants contains no requirement that employers verify the authenticity of documents presented by job applicants. To reduce the magnet of US jobs, more vigorous worksite enforcement aimed at larger employers would have to be coupled with systematic efforts to remove unauthorized immigrants found to be employed by such firms from the labor market and the country. Without such ‘removal’ efforts, targeted workplace enforcement simply scatters unauthorized workers to other employers and industries. <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cri.uci.edu/pdf/JEMS--final.pdf">[39]</a></p>
<p>Both through the appropriations process and in its reluctance to close a giant loophole in the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act on acceptable employment documents that virtually precludes successful prosecutions of employers, the US Congress has sent very clear signals to the executive branch that what truly matters in the immigration control game is border enforcement—not interior enforcement. <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cri.uci.edu/pdf/JEMS--final.pdf">[40]</a></p>
<p>McCarthy and Vernez believe that many of the immigrants settling in the state of California are not likely to be integrated successfully, and that the policy of the federal government need to change. Their book, that was sponsored by the <a href="/wiki/Department_of_Defense.html" title="Department of Defense">Department of Defense</a> and several foundations, concludes with three recommendations for the federal government:</p>
<ol>
<li>reduce total immigration from the current ~2 million per year (~1 million legal and ~1 million illegal) to between 300,000 and 800,000 a year;</li>
<li>expand the number of legal immigration slots available for Mexicans, in exchange for Mexican help to reduce illegal immigration; and</li>
<li>encourage immigrants to learn English and to naturalize.</li>
</ol>
<p>The report also recommends that the state of California do more to help immigrants succeed in school, to encourage English learning and naturalization, and to establish a state office of immigrant affairs to help residents understand immigration better.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a  title="">[11]</a></sup></p>

<p>Critics of the NPR/NSF panel say they addressed only the economic effects of immigration mostly in terms of labor, prices and economic growth and should have included an environmental impact statement including a lot wider spectrum of specialists like environmentalists, fisherery experts, biologists, educators, ethicists, labor experts etc. The report did find that the least skilled Americans have suffered the most from the competition with immigrants and that African-Americans and legalized Hispanices with their lower average levels of education have been harmed the most, but it dismissed that as a serious problem because less than a majority of U.S. citizens are directly affected. The NSF panel did find that immigration may lower some prices (~0.1% on average) but lower prices require the assumption of generally lower wages for some or of higher investment levels in industry which is precisely what cheap wage immigration discourages. Many studies escape from this dilemma, if that is the word, by resorting to the familiar argument that immigrants fill "jobs American won't take." They ignored the fact that, nationwide, all the job categories: even farm workers, service industries, construction etc. are still filled largely by Americans. The so called shortage of labor to fill some of them and the reason that hourly U.S. real wages have been falling almost every year since 1975 is that desperate immigrants will work for wages that Americans don't want to work for. Even the NSF study seems to assume that increased GDP is a net good ignoring the fact that the lower wages and lower taxes collected from the typical illegal immigrant result in a lower GDP/capita. The reason that many like illegal immigrants is that they typically work cheaper than natives, have few legal rights, are pliant and much of their "real" costs can be spread out to anonymous taxpayers. All these effects of most immigration is not most Americans idea of "...Beneficial to U.S.". <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.npg.org/forum_series/wrong_people.htm">[55]</a></p>

<h3>Other Economic Studies</h3>
<p>Previous studies (and many subsequent) of the fiscal impacts of immigration were found to have serious deficiencies. In 1995, only a handful of existing empirical studies were available. According to an article in The National Academies Press, these studies "[...]represented not science but advocay from both sides of the immigration debate, often offered an incomplete accounting of either the full list of taxpayer costs and benefits by ignoring some programs and taxes while including others", and that the "foundation of this research was rarely explicitly stated, offering opportunities to tilt the research toward the desired result" <sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a  title="">[14]</a></sup></p>
<ul>
<li>In an article that appeared in the <i>World Policy Journal</i> (1994), Peter Andreas asserts that constraining the flow of illegal immigration in states such as California, may result in economic stagnation. <sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a  title="">[15]</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>A study by the <a href="/wiki/Rand.html" title="Rand">Rand</a> Corporation, conducted by Kevin McCarthy and Georges Vernez, came to the conclusion that immigrants do not have a negative effect on the earnings and the employment opportunities of native-born Americans. <sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a  title="">[16]</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Francine Lipman's opinion is that the belief that undocumented migrants are exploting the US economy and that they cost more in services than they contribute to the economy, is "undeniable false". Lipman asserts that illegal immigrants provide a net positive benefit to federal coffers, because of the tax law's treatment of those in the country illegally and those who are married to illegal immigrants: they are ineligible for the <a href="/wiki/Earned_Income_Credit.html" title="Earned Income Credit">Earned Income Credit</a> and the Child Tax Credit, and that 85% of eminent economists surveyed have concluded that undocumented immigrants have had a positive impact on the U.S. economy <sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a  title="">[17]</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The CIS claims that many illegal immigrants use the U.S. welfare program with false identification. <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cis.org/articles/2003/back503.html">[56]</a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The Identity Theft Resource Center states that one of the two most frequent purchasers of the identify information of minors (for identity theft) is illegal immigrants <sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a  title="">[18]</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Another study put the cost to the federal government at $2,700/household <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cis.org/articles/2004/fiscalexec.html">[57]</a> On average, the costs that illegal households impose on federal government are less than half that of other households, but their tax payments are only one-fourth that of other households.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Still another study put the net costs to California residents at $433/household for European/Canadian immigrants, $1,240/household for Asian immigrants and $8,182/household for Latin American workers <a  class="external text" title="http://darwin.nap.edu/books/0309059984/html/161.html">TABLE 4-7a Net Fiscal Impacts by Nativity of Householder</a> pg 160-1. These are the costs calculated for all immigrants legal and illegal.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Madeleine Cosman contends that the requirement of hospitals to offer service to illegal aliens regardless of the alien's ability to pay has led to many hospitals running a deficit and being forced to close.<a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.jpands.org/vol10no1/cosman.pdf">[58]</a> Also, free public education is extended to all children in the U.S. regardless of their citizen status. The matricula consular and passports are usually considered legal identification by many police agencies and governments.</li>
</ul>
<p>Nearly all modern developed societies like Sweden, Canada and the United States heavily subsidize the cost of all government services for low income people by heavily taxing the higher income people. In the United states the effective federal tax rate considering all federal taxes as calculated by the Congressional Budget office runs from 4.8% for the bottom quintile [0-20%](avg. income = $34k) to 25% for the last quintile [80-100%] of income households. The bottom two income quintiles, with exemptions, are nearly exempt from all income tax and social security taxes are heavily subsidized. Many illegal workers claim they have income tax witheld not bothering to mention it is nearly always negligibly small.<a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cbo.gov/showdoc.cfm?index=5746&amp;sequence=1#table2">[59]</a> The state's tax systems vary more but nearly always tax the higher income people much more than the lower income people.</p>

<h2>Other Effects of immigration, illegal and legal</h2>
<p>A complete study of immigration would have to include more than economists and include an environmental impact study by scientists who study the environment, biology, fisheries, crops, energy consumption, population growth, education, employment, etc.. Looking at the numbers, one of the things that becomes obvious is immigrants (and their higher birth rates) is the leading cause of population growth in the United States resulting invevitably in increased pressure on and damage to the environment of the United States. In addition to the obvious damage done to fragile deserts by hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants tramping through them are many other significant negative environmental impacts of expanded population. The use of increasingly scarce resources like, tax money, schools, uncrowded roads, land, water supplies, fisheries, forests, minerals and energy supplies not to mention increased pollution all endanger or reduce the quality of the environment. <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.npg.org/forum_series/wrong_people.htm">[60]</a> As in most other developed nations, the net growth rate of the native population in the United States without immigration has been close to a stable plateau since 1972 <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.susps.org/">[61]</a>. Driven mainly by immigration the population of the Unites states is projected to exceed 600 million in the next 100 years. Ironically Mexico's population (the main source of legal and illegal immigration) with a reported fertility rate of about 2.3 births per couple (and decreasing) should soon stabilize. More people in the United States means more people living in one of the world's most resource-consuming cultures. Immigration driven, rapid U.S. population growth causes massive environmental problems. One environmental group, the <a href="/wiki/Sierra_Club.html" title="Sierra Club">Sierra Club</a>, while admitting that population growth was a serious environmental problem, voted in 2004 that the subject of immigration (which is causing most population growth) to the United States (where nearly all Sierra Club members live) was “too controversial and divisive” to take a position on. <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.groundswellsierra.org/immigration_nov2004.php">[62]</a> Critics inside the Sierra Club claimed that one of the reasons their leadership was reluctant to become involved became clear in 2004 when it was revealed that David Gelbaum had given the Sierra Club a donation of $100 million (about one years budget) on the condition they refused to come out with anti-immigration policies <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.susps.org/">[63]</a>.</p>

<h4>Sex and bribes in return for immigration</h4>
<p>In September 2005, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service reported that there were over 2,500 cases of their employees facing misconduct charges involving exchanging immigration benefits for sex, bribery, and influences by foreign governments to assist in violations of U.S. border security. In addition, another 50 such cases are being added weekly. These include cases turned over to the CIS and might not be the complete list according to sources speaking to the Washington Times <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.washingtontimes.com/national/20051003-122319-3501r.htm">[64]</a>.

<p>Before passage of the <a href="/wiki/Fourteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution.html" title="Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution">Fourteenth Amendment</a>, in 1865 after the conclusion of the <a href="/wiki/American_Civil_War.html" title="American Civil War">Civil War</a>, the United States commonly granted citizenship on the basis of <a href="/wiki/Jus_soli.html" title="Jus soli">jus soli</a>. The Fourteenth Amendment was originally passed to protect newly emancipated <a href="/wiki/Freedmen.html" title="Freedmen">former slaves</a>, and in keeping with the jus soli tradition of the Republic has been interpreted by the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Supreme_Court.html" title="United States Supreme Court">United States Supreme Court</a>, in precedent set by <i><a href="/wiki/United_States_v._Wong_Kim_Ark.html" title="United States v. Wong Kim Ark">United States v. Wong Kim Ark</a></i> in 1898, to cover everyone born in the U.S. regardless of the citizenship of the parents, with the exception of the children of diplomats. The decision in <i>Wong Kim Ark</i> upheld the <i>jus soli</i> which had often been practiced before the adoption of the 14th Amendment. In short, the Court found that the 14th Amendment re-affirmed <i>jus soli</i>. <i>Wong Kim Ark</i> did not overturn or weaken <i>Elk v. Wilkins</i>; it simply defined <i>jus soli</i>. The Court found that Wong Kim Ark, having been born to Chinese citizens, who were lawfully residing within the United States, and with the intention of amicably obeying its laws, was a citizen of the United States. Under these two rulings, the following persons born in the United States are explicitly not citizens:</p>
<ul>
<li>Children born to foreign diplomats</li>
<li>Children born to enemy forces in hostile occupation of the United States</li>
<li>Children born to <a href="/wiki/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States.html" title="Native Americans in the United States">Native Americans</a> who are members of tribes not taxed (these were later given full citizenship by the <a href="/wiki/Indian_Citizenship_Act_of_1924.html" title="Indian Citizenship Act of 1924">Indian Citizenship Act of 1924</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>The following persons born in the United States are explicitly citizens:</p>
<ul>
<li>Children born to US citizens</li>
<li>Children born to aliens who are lawfully inside the United States (resident or visitor), with the intention of amicably interacting with its people, and obeying its laws.</li>
</ul>
<p>Under these rulings, the citizenship status of the U.S.-born children of <a href="/wiki/Illegal_immigrant.html" title="Illegal immigrant">illegal immigrants</a> is in the same gray area as people born in foreign countries of foreign parents - that is, neither ruling explicitly denies or grants them citizenship. Various aspects of both <i>Elk v. Wilkins</i> and <i>Wong Kim Ark</i> lend reasoning that such children are not US citizens. <i>Wong Kim Ark</i> is often cited as granting the children of illegal aliens US citizenship, but the ruling is explicit in that it applies to the children of aliens who are legally within the United States. Some may even argue that it implicitly denies them citizenship by doing so. However, in terms of Supreme Court rulings, or the rulings of any court, implicit is meaningless. The <i>status quo</i> is that the children of illegal aliens are US citizens, and it will remain that way until government policy changes or is challenged, and the Supreme Court inevitably makes an explicit ruling.</p>
<p>Some legislators, reacting to illegal immigration, have proposed that this be changed, either through legislation or a <a href="/wiki/Constitutional_amendment.html" title="Constitutional amendment">constitutional amendment</a>. The proposed changes are usually one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The child should have at least one parent who is a U.S. citizen. (requires amendment)</li>
<li>The child should have at least one parent who is a U.S. citizen or <a href="/wiki/Permanent_resident.html" title="Permanent resident">permanent resident</a> (requires amendment)</li>
<li>The child should have at least one parent who is lawfully present in the United States (requires an Act of Congress, probably challenged to the Supreme Court).</li>
</ul>

Similarly, Representative <a href="/wiki/Ron_Paul.html" title="Ron Paul">Ron Paul</a> of <a href="/wiki/Texas.html" title="Texas">Texas</a> has introduced a constitutional amendment that would explicitly deny automatic citizenship to U.S.-born children unless at least one parent is a citizen or permanent resident <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d109:hr698:">[66]</a>. Neither of these measures has come to a vote. Even if Rep. Deal's legislation were passed by Congress, it would likely be struck down by the courts based on the precedent established in <i>U.S. v. Wong Kim Ark</i>, which allows for the US born children of lawful visitors to be citizens as well. The issue remains controversial, reflecting both tensions about immigration and disputes about the appropriate balance of power between the courts and the Congress.</p>
<p>Children of families where at least one parent is an illegal immigrant are sometimes referred to as <i><a href="/wiki/Anchor_baby.html" title="Anchor baby">anchor babies</a></i> because once the illegal family's mother gives birth to the baby inside the U.S., the baby is said to "anchor" them to the U.S.. Legally the illegal parent or parents can still be deported so the anchor is more perceived than real. However, some illegal immigrant advocates and some of the children with parents of mixed legal immigration status feel the term "Anchor Baby" is <a href="/wiki/Pejorative.html" title="Pejorative">pejorative</a>.</p>
<p>According to the Center for Immigration Studies, "383,000, or 42 percent, of births to immigrants are to illegal alien mothers.

<p>The <a href="/wiki/Immigration_Reform_and_Control_Act_of_1986.html" title="Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986">Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986</a> (IRCA) made the hiring of an individual without documents an offense for the first time. Enforcement has been lax, but major businesses have often been found to use illegal immigrants. The act is somewhat redundant since the forging of government documents (fake immigration documents or providing falsified social security numbers) is already a felony, and for most companies such documents must be provided to the government in its tax filings. However, the government does not notify those whose identities have been stolen for the falsified social security numbers, thus making it difficult to estimate the extent of the problem. <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6814673/">[68]</a></p>

<p><a name="Immigration_with_and_without_quotas" id="Immigration_with_and_without_quotas"></a></p>
<h3>Immigration with and without quotas</h3>
<p>The immigration quota system was first expanded with the <a href="/wiki/Emergency_Quota_Act.html" title="Emergency Quota Act">Emergency Quota Act</a> of 1921 which was used to reduce the influx of East and Southern European immigrants who were coming to the country in large numbers from the turn of the century. This immigration was further reduced by the <a href="/wiki/Immigration_Act_of_1924.html" title="Immigration Act of 1924">Immigration Act of 1924</a> which was structured to maintain the cultural and ethnic traditions of the United States.</p>
<p>There has never been a quota for Jews or any other religious group, only for people from specific countries. The waiting list for the few available immigration spots grew enormously in the 1930s in the U.S. and throughout the free world that was accepting any immigration. In the 1930's the number of Jewish immigrant applicants seeking visa to the U.S. alone exceeded the quota for all of Germany. <a href="/wiki/Adolf_Hitler.html" title="Adolf Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> started his <a href="/wiki/Holocast.html" title="Holocast">Holocast</a> program in the 1930's that ultimately led to the death of over 10,000,000 people including 6,000,000 Jews. The <a href="/wiki/Franklin_D._Roosevelt.html" title="Franklin D. Roosevelt">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a> administration had nearly shut down immigration during the decade of the <a href="/wiki/Great_Depression_of_1929.html" title="Great Depression of 1929">Great Depression of 1929</a>. In 1929 there were 279,678 immigrants recorded and in 1933 there were only 23,068 <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.uscis.gov/graphics/shared/statistics/">[69]</a>. By 1939 recorded immigrants had crept back up to 82,998 but then the advent of World War II drove it back down to 23,725 in 1943 increasing slowly to 38,119 by 1945 <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.uscis.gov/graphics/shared/statistics/">[70]</a>. After 1946 about 600,000 of Europe's Displaced Person (DP's) refugees were admitted under special laws outside the country quotas, and in the 1960s and 1970s large numbers of Cuban and Vietnamese refugees <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.uscis.gov/graphics/shared/statistics/">[71]</a> were admitted under special laws outside all quotas. Congress passed the <a href="/wiki/Immigration_and_Nationality_Services_Act_of_1965.html" title="Immigration and Nationality Services Act of 1965">Immigration and Nationality Services Act of 1965</a> which esssentially removed all nation-specific quotas, while retaining an overall quota, and included immigrants from Mexico and the Western Hemisphere for the first time with their own quotas. It also put a large part of immigration, so-called family reunification, outside the quota system. This dramatically changed the number, type and composition of the new arrivals from mostly European, to predominantly poor <a href="/wiki/Latino.html" title="Latino">Latino</a> and <a href="/wiki/Asian.html" title="Asian">Asian</a>. It also dramatically increased the number of illegal immigrants as many poorer people now had family or friends in the U.S. that attracted them there. <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.city-journal.org/html/16_3_immigrants_economy.html">[72]</a> In 1986, the <a href="/wiki/Immigration_Reform_and_Control_Act.html" title="Immigration Reform and Control Act">Immigration Reform and Control Act</a> (IRCA) was passed, creating amnesty for about 3,000,000 illegal immigrants already in the United States. Critics believe IRCA just intensified the illegal immigration flow as those granted amnesty illegally brought more of their friends and family into the U.S.. <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.city-journal.org/html/16_3_immigrants_economy.html">[73]</a></p>
<p>Without quotas on large segments of the immigration flow, legal immigration to the U.S. surged and soon became largely family based "Chain immigration" where familys brought in a never ending chain of off quota new immigrant family members. The number of legal immigrants rose from about 2.5 million in the 1950s to 4.5 million in the 1970s to 7.3 million in the 1980s to about 10 million in the 1990s. In 2006 legal immigrants to the United States now number approximately 1,000,000 legal immigrants per year of which about 600,000 are Change of Status immigrants who already are in the U.S. (Pew Hispanic Data Estimates<a  class="external autonumber" title="http://pewhispanic.org/files/reports/44.pdf">[74]</a>, <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.city-journal.org/html/16_3_immigrants_economy.html">[75]</a>) (Pew Hispanic Data Estimates<a  class="external autonumber" title="http://pewhispanic.org/files/reports/44.pdf">[76]</a>, <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.city-journal.org/html/16_3_immigrants_economy.html">[77]</a>)</p>

<h2>Historical context</h2>
<p>Every wave of immigration into the United States has faced fear and hostility, especially during times of economic hardship, political turmoil, or war: in 1882, Congress passed the <a href="/wiki/Chinese_Exclusion_Act_%28United_States%29.html" title="Chinese Exclusion Act (United States)">Chinese Exclusion Act</a>, one of our nation's first immigration laws, to keep out all people of Chinese origin; during the "Red Scare" of the 1920s, thousands of foreign-born people suspected of political radicalism were arrested and brutalized; many were deported without a hearing; and in 1942, 120,000 Americans of Japanese descent were interned in camps until the end of World War II.</p>

<p>In 1882 the Chinese Exclusion Act had cut off nearly all <a href="/wiki/China.html" title="China">Chinese</a> immigration. The first laws creating a <a href="/wiki/Quota.html" title="Quota">quota</a> for immigrants were passed in the 1920s, in response to a sense that the country could no longer absorb large numbers of unskilled workers, despite pleas by big business that it wanted the new workers. Ngai (2003) shows that the new laws were the beginning of mass illegal immigration, because they created a new class of persons — illegal aliens — whose inclusion in the nation was at once a social reality and a legal impossibility. This contradiction challenged received notions of sovereignty and democracy in several ways. First, the increase in the number of illegal entries created a new emphasis on control of the nation's borders — especially the long Canadian border. Second, the application of the deportation laws gave rise to an oppositional political and legal discourse, which imagined "deserving" and "undeserving" illegal immigrants and, therefore, just and unjust deportations. These categories were constructed out of modern ideas about crime, sexual morality, the family, and race. In the 1930s federal deportation policy became the object of legal reform to allow for administrative discretion in deportation cases. Just as restriction and deportation "made" illegal aliens, administrative discretion "unmade" illegal aliens. Administrative law reform became an unlikely site where problems of national belonging and inclusion played out.</p>

<h3>History of border security</h3>
<p>For a period of time in the 1990s U.S. Army personnel were stationed along the U.S.-Mexico border to help stem the flow of illegal aliens and drug smugglers. These military units brought their specialized equipment such as FLIR infrared devices, and helicopters. In conjunction with the U.S. Border Patrol, they would deploy along the border and, for a brief time, there would be no traffic across that border which was actively watched by "coyotes" paid to assist border crossers. The smugglers and the alien traffickers ceased operations over the one hundred mile sections of the border sealed at a time. Sher Zieve claims this was very effective but temporary as the illegal traffic resumed as soon as the military withdrew.<a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.renewamerica.us/columns/zieve/060713">[78]</a>. After the <a href="/wiki/September_11%2C_2001_attack.html" title="September 11, 2001 attack">September 11, 2001 attacks</a> the United States looked at the feasibility of placing soldiers along the U.S.-Mexico border as a security measure. <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/front/4018573.html">[79]</a>], <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://newsfromtheborder.blogspot.com/2006/07/del-rio-border-influx-drops.html">[80]</a>, <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2006/06/national-guard-presence-cutting-number.php">[81]</a></p>
<p>In December, 2005, the U.S. House of Representatives voted to build a <a href="/wiki/Separation_barrier.html" title="Separation barrier">separation barrier</a> along parts of the border not already protected by a separation barriers. A later vote in the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Senate.html" title="United States Senate">United States Senate</a> on <a href="/wiki/May_17.html" title="May 17">May 17</a>, <a href="/wiki/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>, included a plan to blockade 860 miles of the border with vehicle barriers and triple-layer fencing along with granting amnesty to the 12 million illegal immigrants in the U.S. and roughly doubling legal immigration. <a href="/wiki/Bay_Buchanan.html" title="Bay Buchanan">Bay Buchanan</a>, head of <a href="/wiki/Team_America.html" title="Team America">Team America</a>, an <a href="/wiki/Immigration_reduction.html" title="Immigration reduction">immigration reduction</a> <a href="/wiki/Political_action_committee.html" title="Political action committee">political action committee</a>, estimated that it would take less than six months to build a 2,000 mile, triple-layer fence and would cost roughly $1.5—3 billion. On the same show, Buchanan claimed that the 1990s-era border security program <a href="/wiki/Operation_Gatekeeper.html" title="Operation Gatekeeper">Operation Gatekeeper</a> cut down unauthorized immigration by 90%. The actual numbers are not quite that high with 565,581 apprehensions in San Diego district in fiscal year 1992 before Operation Gatekeeper and its enhanced border fencing and policing to a low of 100,681 apprehensions in in 2002 — an 82% reduction. Apprehensions in 2006 are at 138,608 or a 75% reduction. <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ccis-ucsd.org/news/SDUT-4-16-06.pdf">[82]</a> Apprehensions have gone up in other areas as border security was enhanced in San Diego and El Paso which saw a similar drop in apprehensions.</p>

"The sad irony is that the most important constraint on the flow of illegal immigrants may be continued economic stagnation in states such as California. In periods of recession, labor markets tighten, reducing em- ployment opportunities--both legal and illegal. Economic recovery, on the other hand--propelled in no small part by the hard work of illegal laborers already here-- would expand opportunities in the labor market, encouraging continued illegal immigration."</li>

The widespread belief is that illegal aliens cost more in government services than they contribute to the economy. This belief is undeniably false. [E]very empirical study of illegals' economic impact demonstrates the opposite . . .: undocumenteds actually contribute more to public coffers in taxes than they cost in social services. Moreover, undocumented immigrants contribute to the U.S. economy through their investments and consumption of goods and services; filling of millions of essential worker positions resulting in subsidiary job creation, increased productivity and lower costs of goods and services; and unrequited contributions to Social Security, Medicare and unemployment insurance programs. Eighty-five percent of eminent economists surveyed have concluded that undocumented immigrants have had a positive (seventy-four percent) or neutral (eleven percent) impact on the U.S. economy."</li>

"What is required is a permanent independent review commission to investigate complaints of Border Patrol abuse. An independent review commission would ensure impartial and thorough investigations, and it would hold Border Patrol agents accountable for their actions. The internal nature of the Justice Department's current complaint review procedure keeps most Americans uneducated about the problems of abuse that exist at the border. This in turn creates an attitude of indifference when a few of the incidents reach the media. Creating an independent citizen review board would make the American public aware of the serious problem of abuse that exists at the border by making this review process public. Illegal immigrants deserve the same constitutionally-mandated humane treatment expected by American citizens and legal residents. Border Patrol abuse of illegal immigrants must end."</li>
<li id="_note-25"><b><a  title="">^</a></b> Huspek, Michael, Jimenez, Leticia, Martinez, Roberto <i>Violations of Human and Civil Rights on the U.S.-Mexico Border, 1995 to 1997: A Report</i>, Social Justice, Vol. 25, 1998. "The data compiled in this report suggest that law enforcement in the southwest region of the United States may be verging on lawlessness. This statement receives fuller support from announcements emanating from the INS. In December 1997, John Chase, head of the INS Office of Internal Audit (OIA), announced at a press conference that public complaints to the INS had risen 29% from 1996, with the "vast majority" of complaints emanating from the southwest border region. Over 2,300 complaints were filed in 1997 as opposed to the 1,813 complaints filed in 1996. Another 400 reports of "minor misconduct" were placed in a new category. Chase was quick to emphasize, however, that the 243 "serious" allegations of abuse and use of excessive force that could warrant criminal prosecution were down in 1997, as compared with the 328 in 1996. These "serious" cases are considered to be distinct from less serious complaints, such as "verbal abuse, discrimination, extended detention without cause."</li>
