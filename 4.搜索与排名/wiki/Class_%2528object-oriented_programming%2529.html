			<p>In <a href="/wiki/Object-oriented_programming.html" title="Object-oriented programming">object-oriented programming</a>, <b>classes</b> are used to group related variables and functions. A class describes a collection of <a href="/wiki/Information_hiding.html" title="Information hiding">encapsulated</a> <a href="/wiki/Instance_variable.html" title="Instance variable">instance variables</a> and <a href="/wiki/Method_%28object-oriented_programming%29.html" title="Method (object-oriented programming)">methods</a> (functions), possibly with implementation of those types together with a constructor function that can be used to create objects of the class.</p>
<p>A class is a <a href="/wiki/Cohesion_%28computer_science%29.html" title="Cohesion (computer science)">cohesive</a> package that consists of a particular kind of compile-time <a href="/wiki/Metadata.html" title="Metadata">metadata</a>. It describes the rules by which <a href="/wiki/Object_%28object-oriented_programming%29.html" title="Object (object-oriented programming)">objects</a> behave; these objects are referred to as "<a href="/wiki/Instance.html" title="Instance">instances</a>" of that class. A class specifies the structure of data which each instance contains as well as the <a href="/wiki/Method_%28computer_science%29.html" title="Method (computer science)">methods</a> (<a href="/wiki/Function_%28computer_science%29.html" title="Function (computer science)">functions</a>) which manipulate the data of the object and perform tasks; such methods are sometimes described as "<a href="/wiki/Behavior.html" title="Behavior">behavior</a>". A method is a function with a special property that it has access to data stored in an object. A class is the most specific <a href="/wiki/Datatype.html" title="Datatype">type</a> of an object in relation to a specific <a href="/wiki/Layer.html" title="Layer">layer</a>. A class may also have a representation (<a href="/wiki/Metaobject.html" title="Metaobject">metaobject</a>) at run-time, which provides run-time support for manipulating the class-related <a href="/wiki/Metadata.html" title="Metadata">metadata</a>.</p>
<p>Instances of a class will have certain aspects (aka: features, attributes or properties) in common. A class '<a href="/wiki/Person.html" title="Person">Person</a>' for example would describe the properties common to all instances of the 'Person' class. One of the benefits of programming with classes is that all instances of a particular class will follow the defined behaviour of the class they instantiate. Each person is generally alike; but varies in such properties as "height" and "weight". The class would list types of such instance variables; and also define, via methods, the <a href="/wiki/Action_%28philosophy%29.html" title="Action (philosophy)">actions</a> which humans can perform: "run", "jump", "sleep", "throw object", etc.</p>

<p><a name="Interfaces" id="Interfaces"></a></p>
<h2>Interfaces</h2>
<p>A class can "implement" (or "realize") multiple <a href="/wiki/Interface_%28computer_science%29.html" title="Interface (computer science)">interfaces</a>, each of which specify one or more abstract method signatures (name and type of the method and its parameters) which must be defined (overridden) in that class.</p>
<p>Unlike <a href="/wiki/Multiple_inheritance.html" title="Multiple inheritance">multiple inheritance</a> where actual code is inherited (along with naming and logical conflicts) interfacing allows to define a behaviour-interface (methods) all implementing classes should be able to fulfill. Partial implementations of interfaces are not allowed, that is, every specified method has to have an implementation. However some languages do not require that every parameter combination needs to be supported.</p>
<p>Each interface of the class is associated with a type of <a href="/wiki/Object_reference.html" title="Object reference">object references</a> referring to the interface, through which methods of objects can be invoked. Each reference points to a single instance of the class. Each reference has a <a href="/wiki/Lifetime.html" title="Lifetime">lifetime</a>, which specifies how long the reference can be used, usually bound to the time when some specific operations are invoked via the interface. It is assumed that there is a mechanism for accessing the object with a valid object reference. However, while the object reference is a reference to a specific location at any one time, over time the same object can be located at different places.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Object-oriented_programming.html" title="Object-oriented programming">object-oriented programming</a> methodology is designed in such a way that the operations of any interface of a class are usually chosen to be independent of each other. This means that an interface places no requirements for clients to invoke the operations of one interface in any particular order. This approach has the benefit that client code can rely that the operations of an interface are available for use whenever the client holds a valid reference to the object. This will also result in a <a href="/wiki/Client-server.html" title="Client-server">client-server</a> (or layered) design where servers do not depend in any way on the clients.</p>
<p>The methods that are not in any of the interfaces of a class are private to the class, and not intended to be depended on by other classes.</p>
<p>The "set of all interfaces of a class" is sometimes called the interface of the class.</p>
<p>The internal data structures defined as part of a class are not considered to be part of its interface. Rather, public <i>accessor</i> methods can be used to inspect or alter object data. The various <a href="/wiki/Object-oriented.html" title="Object-oriented">object-oriented</a> programming languages enforce this to various degrees. For example, <a href="/wiki/Java_programming_language.html" title="Java programming language">Java</a> does not allow the programmer to access the private data of a class at all, whereas in languages like <a href="/wiki/Objective-C.html" title="Objective-C">Objective-C</a> or <a href="/wiki/Perl.html" title="Perl">Perl</a> the programmer can do what they want. In <a href="/wiki/C%2B%2B.html" title="C++">C++</a>, private methods are visible but not accessible in the interface; however they are commonly made invisible by explicitly declaring fully abstract classes that represent the interfaces of the class.</p>

<h2>Structure of a class</h2>
<div class="thumb tright">
<div style="width:163px;"><a  class="internal" title="UML notation for classes"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/18/Oop-uml-class-example.png" alt="UML notation for classes" width="161" height="206" longdesc="/wiki/Image:Oop-uml-class-example.png" /></a>
<div class="thumbcaption"><a href="/wiki/Unified_Modeling_Language.html" title="Unified Modeling Language">UML</a> notation for classes</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>A class contains a description of structure of data ("<a href="/wiki/State_%28computer_science%29.html" title="State (computer science)">state</a>") stored in the objects of the class. The state of an object is stored in some resource, such as memory or a file. The storage is assumed to be located in a specific location, such that it is possible to access the object via <a href="/wiki/Reference_%28computer_science%29.html" title="Reference (computer science)">references</a> to the <a href="/wiki/Identity_%28object-oriented_programming%29.html" title="Identity (object-oriented programming)">identity</a> of the objects. However, the actual storage location associated with an object may change with time. In such situations, the identity of the object does not change. The state is encapsulated and every access to the state occurs via methods of the class. Specific data items in the state, such as xsize and ysize in the example, are sometimes called class attributes or class properties.</p>
<p>A class implements its interfaces by specifying methods that describe what operations can be performed on the data stored in the objects of the class. Each method specifies only tasks that are related to the stored data. <a href="/wiki/Multimethod.html" title="Multimethod">Multimethods</a> can be used when a single task requires access to many objects' data.</p>
<p>A class also describes a set of <a href="/wiki/Invariant_%28computer_science%29.html" title="Invariant (computer science)">invariants</a> that are preserved by every method in the class. An invariant is a constraint on the state of an object that should be satisfied by every object of the class. The main purpose of the invariants is to establish what objects belong to the class. An invariant is what distinguishes <a href="/wiki/Datatype.html" title="Datatype">datatypes</a> and classes from each other, that is, a class does not allow use of all possible values for the state of the object, only those that are well-defined by the semantics of the intended use of the datatype. The set of supported methods often implicitly establishes an invariant. Some programming languages support specification of invariants as part of the definition of the class, and enforce them via the type system. Encapsulation of state is necessary for being able to enforce the invariants of the class.</p>
<p>An implementation of a class specifies <a href="/wiki/Constructor.html" title="Constructor">constructor</a> and <a href="/wiki/Destructor_%28computer_science%29.html" title="Destructor (computer science)">destructor</a> functions that allow creation and destruction of objects of the class. A constructor that takes arguments can be used to create an object from <a href="/wiki/Data.html" title="Data">data</a>. The main purpose of a constructor is to establish the invariant of the class, failing if the invariant isn't valid. The main purpose of a destructor is to destroy the identity of the object, invalidating any references in the process. A destructor that returns a value can be used to obtain a public <a href="/wiki/Representation.html" title="Representation">representation</a> (transfer encoding) of an object of a class and simultaneously destroy the copy of the object stored in current thread's memory [If supported by the programming language used]. Constructors and destructors are also sometimes used to reserve and release resources associated with the object.</p>
<p>A class can also implement a set of auxiliary <a href="/wiki/Function_%28programming%29.html" title="Function (programming)">functions</a>, sometimes called class functions or static methods. Static methods are often used to find, create or destroy objects of the class. Constructors and destructors are sometimes specified as static methods. Often, mechanisms for sending an object to another location or changing the class of an object are specified as static methods.</p>
<p>The class members can be designated as <i>public</i>, <i>private</i> or <i>protected</i>. The public <a  class="new" title="Access specifier">access specifier</a> means that all clients can access the member by its name. The private access specifier restricts the access to the class itself. The protected access specifier allows the class itself and all its subclasses to access the member. In addition, some languages, such as C++, support a mechanism where a function explicitly declared as <i>friend</i> of the class may access the members designated as private or protected. Access specifiers do not control visibility, in that even private members may be visible to client code. An inaccessible but visible member may be referred to at run-time (e.g. pointer to it can be returned from member functions), but all attempts to use it by referring to the name of the member from client code will be prevented by the type checker. Object-oriented design uses the access specifiers in conjunction with careful design of public method implementations to enforce class invariants. Access specifiers are intended to protect against accidental use of members by clients, but are not suitable for run-time protection of object's data. <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/">[1]</a></p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Associations between classes">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Associations_between_classes" id="Associations_between_classes"></a></p>
<h2>Associations between classes</h2>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/Object-oriented_design.html" title="Object-oriented design">object-oriented design</a> an <a href="/wiki/Association_%28object-oriented_programming%29.html" title="Association (object-oriented programming)">association</a> between two classes is a type of a link between the corresponding objects. A (two-way) association between classes A and B describes a relationship between each object of class A and some objects of class B, and vice versa. Associations are often named with a verb, such as "subscribes-to".</p>
<p>An association role describes the role of an instance of a class when the instance participates in an association. An association role is related to each end of the association. The role describes an instance of a class from the point of view of a situation in which the instance participates in the association. For example, a "subscriber" role describes instances of the class "Person" when it participates in a "subscribes-to" relationship with the class "Magazine". Also, a "Magazine" has the "subscribed magazine" role when the subscribers subscribe-to it.</p>
<p>Association role multiplicity describes how many instances correspond to each instance of the other class(es) of the association. Common multiplicities are "0..1", "1..1", "1..*" and "0..*", where the "*" specifies any number of instances.</p>
<p>There are some special kinds of associations between classes. <a href="/wiki/Composition_%28object-oriented_programming%29.html" title="Composition (object-oriented programming)">Composition</a> between class A and class B describes a "part-of" relationship where instances of class B have shorter lifetime than the lifetime of the corresponding instances of the enclosing class. Class B is said to be a part of class A. This is often implemented in programming languages by allocating the data storage of instances of class A to contain a representation of instances of class B. <a href="/wiki/Aggregation_%28object-oriented_programming%29.html" title="Aggregation (object-oriented programming)">Aggregation</a> is like composition in that it describes that instances of a class are part of instances of the other class, but the constraint on lifetime of the instances is not required. The implementation of aggregation is often via a pointer or reference to the contained instance. In both cases, method implementations of the enclosing class can invoke methods of the part class.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Local classes">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Local_classes" id="Local_classes"></a></p>
<h2>Local classes</h2>
<p>When a class is declared inside a function it is called a local class. It has some unique properties like it can use global as well as static variables of the function declared before the class but can't access automatic variables. Global variables should be used with scope(::) operator.</p>
<p>There are some restriction on its use they can't have static data members and member functions must be defined inside the class only enclosing fuction can't access private members of the class but they can be made to do so by declaring them Friend to that local class.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Partial classes">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Partial_classes" id="Partial_classes"></a></p>
<h2>Partial classes</h2>
<dl>
<dd>
<div class="noprint"><i>Main article: <a href="/wiki/Partial_classes.html" title="Partial classes">Partial classes</a></i></div>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Partial classes are classes that can be split over multiple files, making it easier to deal with large quantities of code. At <a href="/wiki/Compiler.html" title="Compiler">compile</a> time the partial classes are grouped together, thus logically make no difference to the output. An example of the use of partial classes may be the separation of user interface logic and processing logic. A primary benefit of partial classes is allowing different programmers to work on different parts of the same class at the same time. They also make automatically generated code easier to interpret, as it is separated from other code into a partial class. Partial classes have been around in <a href="/wiki/SmallTalk.html" title="SmallTalk">SmallTalk</a> under the name of <i>Class Extensions</i> for considerable time. In pre-beta versions of Visual Studio 2005 the partial keyword was known as "expands" in Visual Basic. With the arrival of the <a href="/wiki/.NET_Framework.html" title=".NET Framework">.NET framework 2</a> <a href="/wiki/Microsoft.html" title="Microsoft">Microsoft</a> then introduced partial classes (see <a href="/wiki/Partial_type.html" title="Partial type">partial types</a>), supported in both <a href="/wiki/C_Sharp.html" title="C Sharp">C# 2.0</a> and <a href="/wiki/Visual_Basic_.NET.html" title="Visual Basic .NET">Visual Basic 2005</a>.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Subclasses and superclasses">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Subclasses_and_superclasses" id="Subclasses_and_superclasses"></a></p>
<h2>Subclasses and superclasses</h2>
<p>Classes are often related in some way. The most popular of these relations is <a href="/wiki/Inheritance_%28computer_science%29.html" title="Inheritance (computer science)">inheritance</a>, which involves <b>subclasses</b> and <b>superclasses</b>, also known respectively as <b>child classes</b> (or <b>derived classes</b>) and <b>parent classes</b> (or <b>base classes</b>). If [car] was a class, then [Jaguar] and [Porsche] might be two sub-classes. If [Button] is a subclass of [Control], then all buttons are controls. Subclasses usually consists of several kinds of modifications (customizations) to their respective superclasses: addition of new instance variables, addition of new methods and <a href="/wiki/Overriding.html" title="Overriding">overriding</a> of existing methods to support the new instance variables.</p>
<p>Conceptually, a superclass should be considered as a common part of its subclasses. This factoring of commonality is one mechanism for providing <a href="/wiki/Reuse.html" title="Reuse">reuse</a>. Thus, extending a superclass by modifying the existing class is also likely to narrow its applicability in various situations. In <a href="/wiki/Object-oriented_design.html" title="Object-oriented design">Object-oriented design</a>, careful balance between applicability and functionality of superclasses should be considered. Subclassing is different from <a href="/wiki/Subtyping.html" title="Subtyping">subtyping</a> in that subtyping deals with common behaviour whereas subclassing is concerned with common structure.</p>
<p>Some <a href="/wiki/Programming_language.html" title="Programming language">programming languages</a> (for example <a href="/wiki/C%2B%2B.html" title="C++">C++</a>) allow <a href="/wiki/Multiple_inheritance.html" title="Multiple inheritance">multiple inheritance</a> -- they allow a child class to have more than one parent class. This technique has been criticized by some for its unnecessary complexity and being difficult to implement efficiently, though some projects have certainly benefited from its use. <a href="/wiki/Java_programming_language.html" title="Java programming language">Java</a>, for example has no multiple inheritance, as its designers felt that it would add unnecessary complexity.</p>
<p>Sub- and superclasses are considered to exist within a <a href="/wiki/Hierarchy_%28object-oriented_programming%29.html" title="Hierarchy (object-oriented programming)">hierarchy</a> defined by the inheritance relationship. If multiple inheritance is allowed, this hierarchy is a <a href="/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph.html" title="Directed acyclic graph">directed acyclic graph</a> (or DAG for short), otherwise it is a <a href="/wiki/Tree_%28graph_theory%29.html" title="Tree (graph theory)">tree</a>. The hierarchy has classes as nodes and inheritance relationships as links. The levels of this hierarchy are called <a href="/wiki/Layer.html" title="Layer">layers</a> or <a href="/wiki/Level_of_abstraction.html" title="Level of abstraction">levels of abstraction</a>. Classes in the same level are more likely to be <a href="/wiki/Association_%28object-oriented_programming%29.html" title="Association (object-oriented programming)">associated</a> than classes in different levels.</p>
<p>There are two slightly different points of view as to whether subclasses of the same class are required to be disjoint. Sometimes, subclasses of a particular class are considered to be completely disjoint. That is, every instance of a class has exactly one <i>most-derived class</i>, which is a subclass of every class that the instance has. This view does not allow dynamic change of object's class, as objects are assumed to be created with a fixed most-derived class. The basis for not allowing changes to object's class is that the class is a compile-time type, which does not usually change at runtime, and polymorphism is utilised for any dynamic change to the object's behaviour, so this ability is not necessary. And design that does not need to perform changes to object's type will be more robust and easy-to-use from the point of view of the users of the class.</p>
<p>From another point of view, subclasses are not required to be disjoint. Then there is no concept of a most-derived class, and all types in the inheritance hierarchy that are types of the instance are considered to be equally types of the instance. This view is based on a dynamic classification of objects, such that an object may change its class at runtime. Then object's class is considered to be its <i>current</i> structure, but changes to it are allowed. The basis for allowing object's class to change is performance. It's more efficient to allow changes to object's type, since references to the existing instances do not need to be replaced with references to new instances when the class of the object changes. However, this ability is not readily available in all programming languages. The performance analysis depends on the proposition that dynamic changes to object structure are common. This may or may not be the case in practice.</p>

<p><a name="Reasons_for_implementing_classes" id="Reasons_for_implementing_classes"></a></p>
<h2>Reasons for implementing classes</h2>
<p>Classes, when used properly, can accelerate development by reducing redundant code entry, testing and bug fixing. If a class has been thoroughly tested and is known to be a solid work, it stands to reason that implementing that class or extending it will reduce if not eliminate the possibility of bugs propagating into the code. In the case of extension new code is being added so it also requires the same level of testing before it can be considered solid.</p>
<p>Another reason for using classes is to simplify the relationships of interrelated data. Rather than writing code to repeatedly draw a GUI window on the terminal screen, it is simpler to represent the window as an object and tell it to draw itself as necessary. With classes, GUI items that are similar to windows (such as dialog boxes) can simply inherit most of their functionality and data structures from the window class. The programmer then need only add code to the dialog class that is unique to its operation. Indeed, GUIs are a very common and useful application of classes, and GUI programming is generally much easier with a good class framework.</p>

<h2>Categories of classes</h2>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Abstract and concrete classes">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Abstract_and_concrete_classes" id="Abstract_and_concrete_classes"></a></p>
<h3>Abstract and concrete classes</h3>
<p>An <b>abstract class</b>, or <i>abstract base class</i> (ABC), is one that is designed <i>only</i> as a <a href="/wiki/Class_%28object-oriented_programming%29.html" title="Class (object-oriented programming)">parent class</a> and from which <a href="/wiki/Class_%28object-oriented_programming%29.html" title="Class (object-oriented programming)">child classes</a> may be derived, and which is not itself suitable for <a href="/wiki/Instance.html" title="Instance">instantiation</a>. Abstract classes are often used to represent <a href="/wiki/Abstraction.html" title="Abstraction">abstract</a> concepts or entities. The incomplete features of the abstract class are then shared by a group of sibling sub-classes which add different variations of the missing pieces. In C++, an abstract class is defined as a class having at least one pure virtual method, i.e., an <a href="/wiki/Abstract_method.html" title="Abstract method">abstract method</a>, which may or may not possess an implementation.</p>
<p>Abstract classes are superclasses which contain <a href="/wiki/Abstract_method.html" title="Abstract method">abstract methods</a> and are defined such that concrete subclasses are to extend them by implementing the <a href="/wiki/Method_%28computer_science%29.html" title="Method (computer science)">methods</a>. The <a href="/wiki/Behavior.html" title="Behavior">behaviors</a> defined by such a class are <i>"generic"</i> and much of the class will be <a href="/wiki/Definition.html" title="Definition">undefined</a> and unimplemented. Before a class derived from an abstract class can be instantiated, it must implement particular methods for all the abstract methods of its parent classes.</p>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/Computing.html" title="Computing">computing</a>, when specifying an <b>abstract class</b>, the programmer is referring to a <strong class="selflink">class</strong> which has elements that are meant to be implemented by inheritance. The <a href="/wiki/Abstraction_%28computer_science%29.html" title="Abstraction (computer science)">abstraction</a> of the class <a href="/wiki/Method_%28computer_science%29.html" title="Method (computer science)">methods</a> to be implemented by the sub-classes is meant to simplify <a href="/wiki/Software_development.html" title="Software development">software development</a>.</p>
<p>A <b>concrete class</b>, however, is a <strong class="selflink">class</strong> for which entities (instances) may be created. This contrasts with abstract classes which can not be <a href="/wiki/Instance.html" title="Instance">instantiated</a> because it defeats its purpose of being an 'abstract'.</p>
<p>Most <a href="/wiki/Object-oriented_programming_language.html" title="Object-oriented programming language">object oriented programming languages</a> allow the <a href="/wiki/Programmer.html" title="Programmer">programmer</a> to specify which classes are considered abstract and will not allow these to be instantiated (in <a href="/wiki/Java_programming_language.html" title="Java programming language">Java</a>, for example, the keyword <i>abstract</i> is used). This also enables the programmer to focus on planning and design. The actual implementation of course is to be done in the derived classes.</p>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/C%2B%2B.html" title="C++">C++</a>, an abstract class is a class having at least one pure virtual function. They can not be instantiated and will generate an error if an attempt is made. They are meant to function as stubs, allowing the programmer to identify what modules of functions (behaviour or methods) are needed without having to actually implement them. This is in line with <a href="/wiki/Object-oriented_programming.html" title="Object-oriented programming">OOP</a>'s philosophy of allowing the programmer to concentrate on how an object should behave without going into the actual detail.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Metaclasses">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Metaclasses" id="Metaclasses"></a></p>
<h3>Metaclasses</h3>
<p>Metaclasses are classes whose instances are classes. A metaclass describes a common structure of a collection of classes. A metaclass can implement a <a href="/wiki/Design_pattern_%28computer_science%29.html" title="Design pattern (computer science)">design pattern</a> or describe a shorthand for particular kinds of classes. Metaclasses are often used to describe <a href="/wiki/Framework.html" title="Framework">frameworks</a>.</p>
<p>In some languages such as <a href="/wiki/Smalltalk.html" title="Smalltalk">Smalltalk</a> and <a href="/wiki/Ruby_programming_language.html" title="Ruby programming language">Ruby</a>, a class is also an object; thus each class is an instance of the unique metaclass, which is built in the language. For example, in <a href="/wiki/Objective-C.html" title="Objective-C">Objective-C</a>, each object and class is an instance of <a  class="new" title="NSObject">NSObject</a>. <a href="/wiki/CLOS.html" title="CLOS">CLOS</a> (Common Lisp Object System) provides <a href="/wiki/Metaobject_protocol.html" title="Metaobject protocol">metaobject protocols</a> (MOP) to implement those classes and metaclasses.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Non-class-based programming">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Non-class-based_programming" id="Non-class-based_programming"></a></p>
<h2>Non-class-based programming</h2>
<p>To the surprise of some familiar with the use of classes in OOP, it has been shown that one can design fully fledged object-oriented languages that do not have builtin supports of classes. Those languages are usually designed with the motive to address the problem of tight-coupling between implementations and interfaces due to the use of classes. For example, the <a href="/wiki/Self_programming_language.html" title="Self programming language">Self</a> language was designed to show that the role of a class can be substituted by using an extant object which serves as a prototype to a new object, and the resulting language is as expressive as <a href="/wiki/Smalltalk.html" title="Smalltalk">Smalltalk</a> with more generality in creating objects. See <a href="/wiki/Class-based_OOP.html" title="Class-based OOP">class-based OOP</a> for the criticism of class-based programming and <a href="/wiki/Object-based_languages.html" title="Object-based languages">object-based languages</a> for such non-class-based languages.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Run-time representation of classes">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Run-time_representation_of_classes" id="Run-time_representation_of_classes"></a></p>
<h3>Run-time representation of classes</h3>
<p>As a datatype, a class is usually considered as a compile-time construct. A language may also support <a href="/wiki/Prototype.html" title="Prototype">prototype</a> or <a href="/wiki/Factory_method_pattern.html" title="Factory method pattern">factory</a> <a href="/wiki/Metaobject.html" title="Metaobject">metaobjects</a> that represent run-time information about classes, or even represent metadata that provides access to <a href="/wiki/Reflection_%28computer_science%29.html" title="Reflection (computer science)">reflection</a> facilities and ability to manipulate data structure formats at run-time. Many languages distinguish this kind of <a href="/wiki/Run-time_type_information.html" title="Run-time type information">run-time type information</a> about classes from a class on the basis that the information is not needed at run-time. Some dynamic languages do not make strict distinctions between run-time and compile-time constructs, and therefore may not distinguish between metaobjects and classes.</p>
<p>For example: if <a href="/wiki/Human.html" title="Human">humans</a> is a <a href="/wiki/Metaobject.html" title="Metaobject">metaobject</a> representing the class Person, then instances of class Person can be created by using the facilities of the human <a href="/wiki/Metaobject.html" title="Metaobject">metaobject</a>.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Classes without inheritance">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Classes_without_inheritance" id="Classes_without_inheritance"></a></p>
<h2>Classes without inheritance</h2>
<p>Not every language that both supports objects and classes is generally seen as object-oriented. Examples are earlier versions of <a href="/wiki/Visual_Basic.html" title="Visual Basic">Visual Basic</a>, which lack the support for inheritance. The lack of inheritance severely impairs the full practice of object-oriented programming. Those languages, sometimes called "object-based languages", do not provide the structural benefits of statically type checked interfaces for objects. This is because in object-based languages it is possible to use and extend data structures and attach methods to them at run-time. This precludes the compiler or interpreter from being able to check the type information specified in the source code as the type is built dynamically and not defined statically. Most of these languages allow for <i>instance behaviour</i> and complex <i>operational polymorphism</i> (see <a href="/wiki/Dynamic_dispatch.html" title="Dynamic dispatch">dynamic dispatch</a> and <a href="/wiki/Polymorphism_%28computer_science%29.html" title="Polymorphism (computer science)">polymorphism</a>).</p>

<p><a name="Instantiation" id="Instantiation"></a></p>
<h2>Instantiation</h2>
<p>As explained above, classes can be used to create new objects by instantiating them. In most languages, the structures as defined by the class determine how the memory used by its instances will be laid out. This technique is known as the <i>cookie-cutter model</i>.</p>
<p>The alternative to the cookie-cutter model is that of for instance <a href="/wiki/Python_programming_language.html" title="Python programming language">Python</a>, where objects are structured as associative key-value containers. In such models, objects that are instances of the same class could contain different instance variables, as state can be dynamically added to the object. This may resemble <a href="/wiki/Prototype-based_languages.html" title="Prototype-based languages">Prototype-based languages</a> in some ways, but it is not equivalent.</p>
