<h2>First generation - "GC"/"GM"</h2>
<p>Introduced in November 1992, the Impreza was offered in either <a href="/wiki/Front_wheel_drive.html" title="Front wheel drive">front wheel drive</a> (FWD) or <a href="/wiki/All_wheel_drive.html" title="All wheel drive">all wheel drive</a> (AWD) versions and as a four-door <a href="/wiki/Sedan.html" title="Sedan">sedan</a>/saloon or five-door <a href="/wiki/Station_wagon.html" title="Station wagon">station wagon</a>/estate. In late 1995, a two-door <a href="/wiki/Coupe.html" title="Coupe">coupe</a> was introduced. The Impreza, like all Subaru-built cars, was equipped with a <a href="/wiki/Flat_engine.html" title="Flat engine">flat engine</a>, a distinguishing Subaru characteristic. Initial engine choices included 1.5L and 1.8L <a href="/wiki/Naturally-aspirated_engine.html" title="Naturally-aspirated engine">naturally-aspirated</a> engines as well as the <a href="/wiki/Turbocharger.html" title="Turbocharger">turbocharged</a> and <a href="/wiki/Intercooler.html" title="Intercooler">intercooled</a> 2.0L engine. The basic turbocharged motor, the <b>EJ20</b>, produced from 240 to 280PS in Japanese market <a href="/wiki/Subaru_Impreza_WRX.html" title="Subaru Impreza WRX">WRX</a> trim depending on model and year. Outside Japan, the turbocharged model was initially rated at 211PS (208 hp) and known variously as the Turbo 2000, GT, GT Turbo, or WRX.</p>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/1994.html" title="1994">1994</a>, Subaru introduced <a href="/wiki/Subaru_Tecnica_International.html" title="Subaru Tecnica International">Subaru Tecnica International</a> (STi) versions of the Impreza in the Japanese Domestic Market (JDM) and European Domestic Market (EDM). These models were upgraded from the WRX in many categories, including blueprinted performance-tuned engines, transmissions, and suspensions. The <a href="/wiki/Subaru_Impreza_WRX_STi.html" title="Subaru Impreza WRX STi">STi</a> versions of the Impreza were immensely successful in rallies and popular among street racers. The first STi models featured higher power ratings than the WRX, while later versions of both WRX and STi were rated at 280PS due to the Japanese manufacturers' informal agreements around power ratings. Its top <a href="/wiki/Speed.html" title="Speed">speed</a> was electronically limited at 250&#160;km/h (155&#160;mph) and it had a 0–100&#160;km/h time of 4.7&#160;seconds. RA (race altered) versions of the WRX and STi were also available in the Japanese market. Targeted for race and rally, the RA versions were generally lighter in weight; featuring reduced soundproofing, manual windows, no air conditioning, and added desirable features such as more robust engines, driver controlled center differentials, and shorter gearing.</p>
<p>Special editions of the Impreza were very common in Japan and Europe, many coinciding with a significant World Rally Championship victory. These editions included the Series McRae, 555, Catalunya, Terzo, RB5, P1, and 22B, the latter still considered by many to be the ultimate Impreza of all time with its wide arched rally style body.</p>
<p>In the same time Subaru made a limited edition of Impreza Wagon called CasaBlanca.</p>
<p>The Impreza received an external facelift for the 1997 model year, followed by an interior redesign in 1998.</p>
<p>The story of the North American Impreza is much different than the rest of the world. North American markets never received a turbocharged version of the first generation Impreza (it was heavily rumored in 1998 and 1999). Subaru had never had much of a performance image in North America. As such, Subaru initially offered the Impreza with the 1.8L engine, with 2.2L engine and AWD as options. In 1995, Subaru's North American divisions decided to move to the niche market of only AWD cars, subsequently all Subarus (including the Impreza) came equipped with AWD standard.</p>
<p>However, there was a minority that knew of the Impreza's accomplishments overseas and was very interested in having a high performance Impreza. To cater to these enthusiasts' demands and to test the waters for a full-fledged turbo model, the 2.5RS performance model was introduced in 1998. A <a href="/wiki/Naturally-aspirated_engine.html" title="Naturally-aspirated engine">naturally-aspirated</a> 165 hp 2.5L DOHC engine and larger brakes, borrowed from the <a href="/wiki/Subaru_Legacy.html" title="Subaru Legacy">Legacy</a>, were fitted into the coupe body with large 16" gold five-spoke wheels. The 2.5RS also featured several external cues from its overseas bretheren such as hood vents, a hood scoop, and a rally inspired rear spoiler. The 1999 model featured several changes: The newly designed "Phase II" SOHC version of the same 2.5L engine featured a slightly higher peak torque (166 ft·lbf vs. 162 ft·lbf), retained the same wheel design but colored silver, an updated interior, and US versions became visually similar to its Japanese contemporaries with an updated front bumper. 2000 and 2001 (North America didn't see the GD model until model year 2002) 2.5RS models became available in <a href="/wiki/Sedan.html" title="Sedan">sedan</a> form with more features and options each succeeding year. The highest production numbers for the 2.5RS was in 2000.</p>
<p>The Outback Sport model was introduced in 1995 as an updated L Sport Wagon. Subaru found success with this model and that of the larger <a href="/wiki/Subaru_Legacy.html" title="Subaru Legacy">Legacy</a>-based <a href="/wiki/Subaru_Outback.html" title="Subaru Outback">Outback</a>. It offered similar ride height changes, body colors and trim levels to the larger model.</p>

Subaru Impreza (2001) manufactured for Japanese market</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Subaru introduced the so-called "New Age" Impreza to the world market in 2001. The second generation Impreza was intended to be larger, safer, stiffer, more refined, and more responsive. For many enthusiasts, the changes in the new car made it less desirable because it was heavier and slower with less of a raw edge to it. The WRX Sedan had a 20 mm wider track than its predecessor to aid handling, while the wagon remained the same. The coupe model was no longer available. The ovoid headlamp "bug-eyed" styling of the New Age Impreza was polarizing, but the improvements to the car brought greater mainstream acceptance.</p>
<p>In the United States, release of the basic 227&#160;hp 2.0&#160;L turbocharged Impreza, the WRX, did not occur until the <a href="/wiki/2002.html" title="2002">2002</a> model year, and the Impreza WRX STi was delayed until the <a href="/wiki/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a> model year. The US version of the STi includes various departures from the Japanese and European counterparts, such as a turbocharged 2.5&#160;L <b>EJ25</b> engine (not to be confused with the <a href="/wiki/Naturally-aspirated_engine.html" title="Naturally-aspirated engine">naturally-aspirated</a> engine used in the 2.5RS which is also called EJ25), rather than the <a  class="new" title="Twin-scroll turbo">twin-scroll turbo</a> 2.0&#160;L engine sold elsewhere. All 2006 American Imprezas use some form of the 2.5&#160;L EJ25 engine since natrually aspirated and turbo charged are available.</p>
<p>Some customers' and the press' negative reaction to the New Age Impreza's styling forced Subaru to facelift the car by <a href="/wiki/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a>, with more conventional, squarer headlamps. All <a href="/wiki/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> Imprezas, including the performance models, have been redesigned again with the controversial "jet intake and wings" grille first debuted on the <a href="/wiki/Subaru_B9_Tribeca.html" title="Subaru B9 Tribeca">Subaru B9 Tribeca</a> <a href="/wiki/SUV.html" title="SUV">SUV</a>, along with new headlights, taillights, and bumpers. Opinion on this style is split, but is generally regarded as better applied on the Impreza than the Tribeca.</p>
<p>The most basic Impreza is <b>TS</b> with 1.6 liter SOHC engine. It's offered in Singapore and other Asian countries. Models offered in <a href="/wiki/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australia</a> in 2005 included the GX (2.0&#160;L engine, this model has become the baseline Impreza in Australia), RV (2.0&#160;L engine, styled for active lifestyles), RS (2.5&#160;L engine, sport model) along with the WRX and STi version thereof. The RX model has been abandoned in Australia, and its position in the Impreza line-up has been subsumed by the GX (which had formerly been a sparsely outfitted budget model).</p>
<p>In late 2005 a new range was released; including the entry-level 2.0i (formerly GX), RV, 2.0R (formerly RS), WRX and WRX STi models. The 2.0R changed from a 2.5 L engine to a slightly more powerful 2.0 L engine; while the turbocharged WRX changed from a 2.0 L engine to a 2.5 L engine. The <a href="/wiki/Automatic_transmission.html" title="Automatic transmission">automatic transmission</a> was dropped from the WRX despite the popularity of the sports shift automatic in other Subarus such as the <a href="/wiki/Subaru_Outback.html" title="Subaru Outback">Outback</a>. Side airbags were added as standard across the range.</p>

<p>The Impreza chassis rose to prominence in <a href="/wiki/Rally.html" title="Rally">rally racing</a> more effectively than Subaru's previous contenders. Prior to the introduction of the Impreza into WRC in 1993, Subaru had fielded its larger <a href="/wiki/Mid-size_car.html" title="Mid-size car">mid-size</a> <a href="/wiki/Subaru_Legacy.html" title="Subaru Legacy">Legacy</a> for rally purposes. However, as rally competition shifted toward smaller and lighter chassis, Subaru needed a smaller and faster car—a role in which the Impreza was immediately successful and in which the Impreza continues to compete effectively, albeit in more powerful versions than were initially introduced. To jumpstart its rally efforts, Subaru had initially teamed with <a href="/wiki/Prodrive.html" title="Prodrive">Prodrive</a> in 1989, a very successful partnership that has lasted to this day. Prodrive also provided input during the Impreza's development to help it become a better rally car.</p>
<p>After winning its first <a href="/wiki/World_Rally_Championship.html" title="World Rally Championship">World Rally Championship</a> event in the <a href="/wiki/Subaru_Legacy.html" title="Subaru Legacy">Legacy</a> at Rally New Zealand, <a href="/wiki/Ari_Vatanen.html" title="Ari Vatanen">Ari Vatanen</a> finished second in the debut rally of the new WRC Impreza. Carlos Sainz brought the Impreza its inaugural victory in the 1994 Acropolis Rally.</p>
<p>The Impreza brought <a href="/wiki/Subaru.html" title="Subaru">Subaru</a> three consecutive WRC titles (<a href="/wiki/1995.html" title="1995">1995</a>–<a href="/wiki/1997.html" title="1997">7</a>) and a driver's championship for <a href="/wiki/Colin_McRae.html" title="Colin McRae">Colin McRae</a> in 1995, the late <a href="/wiki/Richard_Burns.html" title="Richard Burns">Richard Burns</a> in 2001, and <a href="/wiki/Petter_Solberg.html" title="Petter Solberg">Petter Solberg</a> in 2003. While its rivals have come and gone, Subaru and the Impreza have remained one of the only consistent contenders in WRC during the last 13 years.</p>
