The <a href="/wiki/Human_genome.html" title="Human genome">human genome</a> is believed to contain about 25,000 genes. In addition to studying <a href="/wiki/Chromosomes.html" title="Chromosomes">chromosomes</a> to the level of individual genes, genetic testing in a broader sense includes <a href="/wiki/Biochemical.html" title="Biochemical">biochemical</a> tests for the presence or absence of key <a href="/wiki/Proteins.html" title="Proteins">proteins</a> that signal aberrant versions of certain genes.</p>
<p>Genetic testing identifies changes in <a href="/wiki/Chromosomes.html" title="Chromosomes">chromosomes</a>, genes, or proteins. Most of the time, testing is used to find changes that are associated with inherited disorders. The results of a genetic test can confirm or rule out a suspected genetic condition or help determine a person's chance of developing or passing on a <a href="/wiki/Genetic_disorder.html" title="Genetic disorder">genetic disorder</a>.

<p>Genetic testing usually involves examining a person's <a href="/wiki/DNA.html" title="DNA">DNA</a> - taken from <a href="/wiki/Cell_%28biology%29.html" title="Cell (biology)">cells</a> in a sample of <a href="/wiki/Blood.html" title="Blood">blood</a> or, occasionally, from other body fluids or tissues - for some anomaly that flags a disease or disorder. The DNA change can be relatively large: a missing or added piece of a chromosome - even an entire chromosome - that is visible under a <a href="/wiki/Microscope.html" title="Microscope">microscope</a>. Or it can be extremely small, as little as one extra, missing, or altered chemical base. Genes can be overexpressed (too many copies), inactivated, or lost altogether. Sometimes, pieces of chromosomes become switched, or transposed, so that a gene ends up in a location where it is permanently and inappropriately turned on or off.</p>

<p><a name="Types" id="Types"></a></p>
<h2>Types</h2>
<p>Genetic testing is "the analysis of human DNA, <a href="/wiki/RNA.html" title="RNA">RNA</a>, chromosomes, proteins, and certain <a href="/wiki/Metabolites.html" title="Metabolites">metabolites</a> in order to detect heritable disease-related <a href="/wiki/Genotype.html" title="Genotype">genotypes</a>, <a href="/wiki/Mutation.html" title="Mutation">mutations</a>, <a href="/wiki/Phenotype.html" title="Phenotype">phenotypes</a>, or <a href="/wiki/Karyotype.html" title="Karyotype">karyotypes</a> for clinical purposes " (Holtzman &amp; Watson 1997). It can provide information about a person's genes and chromosomes throughout life. Available types of testing include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/wiki/Newborn_screening.html" title="Newborn screening">Newborn screening</a>: Newborn screening is used just after birth to identify genetic disorders that can be treated early in life. The routine testing of infants for certain disorders is the most widespread use of genetic testing—millions of babies are tested each year in the United States. All states currently test infants for <a href="/wiki/Phenylketonuria.html" title="Phenylketonuria">phenylketonuria</a> (a genetic disorder that causes <a href="/wiki/Mental_retardation.html" title="Mental retardation">mental retardation</a> if left untreated) and <a href="/wiki/Congenital.html" title="Congenital">congenital</a> <a href="/wiki/Hypothyroidism.html" title="Hypothyroidism">hypothyroidism</a> (a disorder of the <a href="/wiki/Thyroid.html" title="Thyroid">thyroid</a> gland). Some states also test for other genetic disorders.</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Diagnostic_testing.html" title="Diagnostic testing">Diagnostic testing</a>: Diagnostic testing is used to diagnose or rule out a specific genetic or chromosomal condition. In many cases, genetic testing is used to confirm a diagnosis when a particular condition is suspected based on physical signs and symptoms. Diagnostic testing can be performed at any time during a person's life, but is not available for all genes or all genetic conditions. The results of a diagnostic test can influence a person's choices about health care and the management of the disorder.</li>
<li><a  class="new" title="Carrier testing">Carrier testing</a>: Carrier testing is used to identify people who carry one copy of a gene mutation that, when present in two copies, causes a genetic disorder. This type of testing is offered to individuals who have a family history of a genetic disorder and to people in ethnic groups with an increased risk of specific genetic conditions. If both parents are tested, the test can provide information about a couple's risk of having a child with a genetic condition.</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Prenatal_testing.html" title="Prenatal testing">Prenatal testing</a>: Prenatal testing is used to detect changes in a <a href="/wiki/Fetus.html" title="Fetus">fetus</a>'s genes or chromosomes before birth. This type of testing is offered to couples with an increased risk of having a baby with a genetic or chromosomal disorder. In some cases, prenatal testing can lessen a couple's uncertainty or help them make decisions about a pregnancy. It cannot identify all possible inherited disorders and <a href="/wiki/Birth_defect.html" title="Birth defect">birth defects</a>, however.</li>
<li>Predictive and presymptomatic testing: Predictive and presymptomatic types of testing are used to detect gene mutations associated with disorders that appear after birth, often later in life. These tests can be helpful to people who have a family member with a genetic disorder, but who have no features of the disorder themselves at the time of testing. Predictive testing can identify mutations that increase a person's risk of developing disorders with a genetic basis, such as certain types of <a href="/wiki/Cancer.html" title="Cancer">cancer</a>. For example, an individual with a mutation in <i><a href="/wiki/BRCA1.html" title="BRCA1">BRCA1</a></i> has a 65% cummulative risk of <a href="/wiki/Breast_cancer.html" title="Breast cancer">breast cancer</a> <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=12677558">[1]</a>. Presymptomatic testing can determine whether a person will develop a genetic disorder, such as <a href="/wiki/Hemochromatosis.html" title="Hemochromatosis">hemochromatosis</a> (an iron overload disorder), before any signs or symptoms appear. The results of predictive and presymptomatic testing can provide information about a person’s risk of developing a specific disorder and help with making decisions about medical care.</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Forensic_genetics.html" title="Forensic genetics">Forensic testing</a>: Forensic testing uses DNA sequences to identify an individual for legal purposes. Unlike the tests described above, forensic testing is not used to detect gene mutations associated with disease. This type of testing can identify crime or catastrophe victims, rule out or implicate a crime suspect, or establish biological relationships between people (for example, paternity).</li>
<li>Research testing: Research testing include finding unknown genes, learning how genes work and advancing our understanding of genetic conditions. The results of testing done as part of a research study are usually not available to patients or their healthcare providers.</li>
</ul>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Medical procedure">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Medical_procedure" id="Medical_procedure"></a></p>
<h2>Medical procedure</h2>
<p>Genetic testing is often done as part of a genetic consultation. Once a person decides to proceed with genetic testing, a medical geneticist, genetic counsellor, primary care doctor, or specialist can order the test after obtaining <a href="/wiki/Informed_consent.html" title="Informed consent">informed consent</a>.</p>
<p>Genetic tests are performed on a sample of <a href="/wiki/Blood.html" title="Blood">blood</a>, <a href="/wiki/Hair.html" title="Hair">hair</a>, <a href="/wiki/Skin.html" title="Skin">skin</a>, <a href="/wiki/Amniotic_fluid.html" title="Amniotic fluid">amniotic fluid</a> (the fluid that surrounds a fetus during pregnancy), or other tissue. For example, a procedure called a <b>buccal smear</b> uses a small brush or cotton swab to collect a sample of cells from the inside surface of the cheek. The sample is sent to a laboratory where technicians look for specific changes in chromosomes, DNA, or proteins, depending on the suspected disorder. The laboratory reports the test results in writing to a person's doctor or genetic counselor.</p>
<p>Routine newborn screening tests are done on a small blood sample, which is taken by pricking the baby's heel. Unlike other types of genetic testing, a parent will usually only receive the result if it is positive.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Interpreting results">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Interpreting_results" id="Interpreting_results"></a></p>
<h3>Interpreting results</h3>
<p>The results of genetic tests are not always straightforward, which often makes them challenging to interpret and explain. When interpreting test results, healthcare professionals consider a person’s medical history, family history, and the type of genetic test that was done.</p>
<p>A positive test result means that the laboratory found a change in a particular <a href="/wiki/Gene.html" title="Gene">gene</a>, <a href="/wiki/Chromosome.html" title="Chromosome">chromosome</a>, or <a href="/wiki/Protein.html" title="Protein">protein</a> of interest. Depending on the purpose of the test, this result may confirm a diagnosis, indicate that a person is a carrier of a particular genetic mutation, identify an increased risk of developing a disease (such as <a href="/wiki/Cancer.html" title="Cancer">cancer</a>) in the future, or suggest a need for further testing. Because family members have some genetic material in common, a positive test result may also have implications for certain blood relatives of the person undergoing testing. It is important to note that a positive result of a predictive or presymptomatic genetic test usually cannot establish the exact risk of developing a disorder. Also, health professionals typically cannot use a positive test result to predict the course or severity of a condition.</p>
<p>A negative test result means that the laboratory did not find a dangerous copy of the gene, chromosome, or protein under consideration. This result can indicate that a person is not affected by a particular disorder, is not a carrier of a specific genetic mutation, or does not have an increased risk of developing a certain disease. It is possible, however, that the test missed a disease-causing genetic alteration because many tests cannot detect all genetic changes that can cause a particular disorder. Further testing may be required to confirm a negative result.</p>
<p>In some cases, a negative result might not give any useful information. This type of result is called uninformative, indeterminate, inconclusive, or ambiguous. Uninformative test results sometimes occur because everyone has common, natural variations in their DNA, called <a href="/wiki/Polymorphism_%28biology%29.html" title="Polymorphism (biology)">polymorphisms</a>, that do not affect health. If a genetic test finds a change in DNA that has not been associated with a disorder in other people, it can be difficult to tell whether it is a natural polymorphism or a disease-causing mutation. An uninformative result cannot confirm or rule out a specific diagnosis, and it cannot indicate whether a person has an increased risk of developing a disorder. In some cases, testing other affected and unaffected family members can help clarify this type of result.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Cost and time">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Cost_and_time" id="Cost_and_time"></a></p>
<h2>Cost and time</h2>
<p>The cost of genetic testing can range from under $100 to more than $2,000, depending on the nature and complexity of the test. The cost increases if more than one test is necessary or if multiple family members must be tested to obtain a meaningful result. In countries with private health insurance, in many cases, health insurance plans will cover the costs of genetic testing when it is recommended by a person's doctor.</p>
<p>From the date that a sample is taken, it may take a few weeks to several months to receive the test results. Results for prenatal testing are usually available more quickly because time is an important consideration in making decisions about a pregnancy.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Benefits">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Benefits" id="Benefits"></a></p>
<h2>Benefits</h2>
<p>Genetic testing has potential benefits whether the results are positive or negative for a gene mutation. Test results can provide a sense of relief from uncertainty and help people make informed decisions about managing their health care. For example, a negative result can eliminate the need for unnecessary checkups and screening tests in some cases. A positive result can direct a person toward available prevention, monitoring, and treatment options. Some test results can also help people make decisions about having children. Newborn screening can identify genetic disorders early in life so treatment can be started as early as possible.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Risks and limitations">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Risks_and_limitations" id="Risks_and_limitations"></a></p>
<h2>Risks and limitations</h2>
<p>The physical risks associated with most genetic tests are very small, particularly for those tests that require only a blood sample or buccal smear (a procedure that samples cells from the inside surface of the cheek). The procedures used for prenatal testing carry a small but real risk of losing the pregnancy (miscarriage) because they require a sample of amniotic fluid or tissue from around the fetus.</p>
<p>Many of the risks associated with genetic testing involve the emotional, social, or financial consequences of the test results. People may feel angry, depressed, anxious, or guilty about their results. In some cases, genetic testing creates tension within a family because the results can reveal information about other family members in addition to the person who is tested. The possibility of <a href="/wiki/Genetic_discrimination.html" title="Genetic discrimination">genetic discrimination</a> in employment or insurance is also a concern.</p>
<p>Genetic testing can provide only limited information about an inherited condition. The test often can't determine if a person will show symptoms of a disorder, how severe the symptoms will be, or whether the disorder will progress over time. Another major limitation is the lack of treatment strategies for many genetic disorders once they are diagnosed.</p>
<p>A genetics professional can explain in detail the benefits, risks, and limitations of a particular test. It is important that any person who is considering genetic testing understand and weigh these factors before making a decision.</p>
<p>Many people are also concerned about the privacy implications of genetic testing. In the <a href="/wiki/United_States.html" title="United States">United States</a>, federal law requires that this kind of medical information is kept confidential.</p>
