<p>The history of <b>Scotland in the High Middle Ages</b> concerns itself with <a href="/wiki/Scotland.html" title="Scotland">Scotland</a> in the era between the death of <a href="/wiki/Donald_II_of_Scotland.html" title="Donald II of Scotland">Domnall II</a> in 900 AD and the death of king <a href="/wiki/Alexander_III_of_Scotland.html" title="Alexander III of Scotland">Alexander III</a> in 1286, which led indirectly to the <a href="/wiki/Scottish_Wars_of_Independence.html" title="Scottish Wars of Independence">Scottish Wars of Independence</a>.</p>
<p>In the tenth and eleventh centuries, northern <a href="/wiki/Great_Britain.html" title="Great Britain">Great Britain</a> was increasingly dominated by <a href="/wiki/Gaels.html" title="Gaels">Gaelic</a> culture, and by a Gaelic <a href="/wiki/Kingdom.html" title="Kingdom">regal lordship</a> known in <a href="/wiki/Goidelic_languages.html" title="Goidelic languages">Gaelic</a> as "<a href="/wiki/Alba.html" title="Alba">Alba</a>", in <a href="/wiki/Latin.html" title="Latin">Latin</a> as either "Albania" or "<a href="/wiki/Scotia.html" title="Scotia">Scotia</a>", and in <a href="/wiki/English_language.html" title="English language">English</a> as "Scotland". From a base in eastern Scotland north of the <a href="/wiki/River_Forth.html" title="River Forth">River Forth</a>, the kingdom acquired control of the lands lying to the south. It had a flourishing culture, comprising part of the larger <a href="/wiki/Gaels.html" title="Gaels">Gaelic-speaking world</a>.</p>
<p>After the <a href="/wiki/12th_century.html" title="12th century">twelfth-century</a> reign of <a href="/wiki/King_David_I.html" title="King David I">King David I</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Scottish_monarchs.html" title="Scottish monarchs">Scottish monarchs</a> are better described as <a href="/wiki/Scoto-Norman.html" title="Scoto-Norman">Scoto-Norman</a> than Gaelic, preferring <a href="/wiki/French_culture.html" title="French culture">French culture</a> to native Scottish culture. They fostered and attached themselves to a kind of Scottish "<a href="/wiki/Norman_Conquest.html" title="Norman Conquest">Norman Conquest</a>". The consequence was the spread of French institutions and social values. Moreover, the first towns, called <a href="/wiki/Burgh.html" title="Burgh">burghs</a>, began in the same era, and as these burghs spread, so did the <a href="/wiki/Middle_English_language.html" title="Middle English language">Middle English language</a>. To a certain degree these developments were offset by the acquisition of the <a href="/wiki/Norse-Gaels.html" title="Norse-Gaels">Norse-Gaelic</a> west, and the <a href="/wiki/Gaelicization.html" title="Gaelicization">Gaelicization</a> of many of the great families of <a href="/wiki/French_people.html" title="French people">French</a> and <a href="/wiki/Normans.html" title="Normans">Anglo-French</a> origin, so that the period closes with what has been called a "Gaelic revival", and an integrated <a href="/wiki/Scottish_national_identity.html" title="Scottish national identity">Scottish national identity</a>. Although there remained a great deal of continuity with the past, by 1286 these economic, institutional, cultural, religious and legal developments had brought Scotland closer to its neighbours in <a href="/wiki/England.html" title="England">England</a> and <a href="/wiki/Continental_Europe.html" title="Continental Europe">the Continent</a>. By 1286 the <a href="/wiki/Kingdom_of_Scotland.html" title="Kingdom of Scotland">Kingdom of Scotland</a> had political boundaries that closely resemble those of modern Scotland.</p>

<h2>Historiography</h2>
<p>Scotland is relatively well-studied in this period. New works come out every year, and the field of Scottish medievalism is a vibrant and changing one. Scottish medievalists can generally be grouped into two categories: Celticists and Normanists. The former, such as <a href="/wiki/David_Dumville.html" title="David Dumville">David Dumville</a>, <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Owen_Clancy.html" title="Thomas Owen Clancy">Thomas Owen Clancy</a> and <a href="/wiki/Dauvit_Broun.html" title="Dauvit Broun">Dauvit Broun</a>, are interested in the native cultures of the country, and often have linguistic training in the <a href="/wiki/Celtic_languages.html" title="Celtic languages">Celtic languages</a>. Normanists are concerned with the French and Anglo-French cultures as they were introduced to Scotland after the <a href="/wiki/Eleventh_century.html" title="Eleventh century">eleventh century</a>. The most prominent of such scholars is <a href="/wiki/G.W.S._Barrow.html" title="G.W.S. Barrow">G.W.S. Barrow</a>, who has devoted his life to studying <a href="/wiki/Feudalism.html" title="Feudalism">feudalism</a> in Britain and Scotland in the High Middle Ages. The change-continuity debate that derives from this division is currently one of the most active topics of discussion. For much of the twentieth century, scholars tended to stress the cultural change that took place in Scotland in the Norman era. However, many scholars, for instance <a href="/wiki/Cynthia_Neville.html" title="Cynthia Neville">Cynthia Neville</a> and <a href="/wiki/Richard_Oram.html" title="Richard Oram">Richard Oram</a>, while not ignoring cultural changes, are arguing that continuity with the Gaelic past was just as, if not more, important.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a  title="">[1]</a></sup></p>

<p>During the period of occupation by the <a href="/wiki/Roman_Empire.html" title="Roman Empire">Roman Empire</a>, the province of <a href="/wiki/Roman_Britain.html" title="Roman Britain">Britannia</a> formally ended at <a href="/wiki/Hadrian%27s_Wall.html" title="Hadrian's Wall">Hadrian's Wall</a>. Between this wall and the <a href="/wiki/Antonine_Wall.html" title="Antonine Wall">Antonine Wall</a>, the Romans fostered a series of <a href="/wiki/Buffer_states.html" title="Buffer states">buffer states</a> separating the Roman-occupied territory from the territory of the <a href="/wiki/Picts.html" title="Picts">Picts</a>. The development of "Pictland" itself, according to the historical model developed by Peter Heather, was a natural response to Roman imperialism.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a  title="">[2]</a></sup> Around 400 the buffer states became the <a href="/wiki/Brythonic_languages.html" title="Brythonic languages">Brythonic</a> kingdoms of "<a href="/wiki/Y_Gogledd_Hen.html" title="Y Gogledd Hen">The Old North</a>", and by 900 the Kingdom of the Picts had developed into the <a href="/wiki/Gaels.html" title="Gaels">Gaelic</a> <a href="/wiki/Kingdom_of_Alba.html" title="Kingdom of Alba">Kingdom of Alba</a>.</p>
<p>In the <a href="/wiki/Tenth_century.html" title="Tenth century">tenth century</a>, the Scottish elite began to develop a conquest myth to explain their Gaelicization, a myth often known as <a href="/wiki/MacAlpin%27s_treason.html" title="MacAlpin's treason">MacAlpin's Treason</a>, in which <a href="/wiki/Kenneth_I_of_Scotland.html" title="Kenneth I of Scotland">Cináed mac Ailpín</a> is supposed to have annihilated the Picts in one fell takeover. The earliest versions include the <i><a  class="new" title="Life of St Cathróe of Metz">Life of St Cathróe of Metz</a></i><sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a  title="">[3]</a></sup> and royal <a href="/wiki/Genealogy.html" title="Genealogy">genealogies</a> tracing their origin to <a href="/wiki/Fergus_M%C3%B3r_mac_Eirc.html" title="Fergus Mór mac Eirc">Fergus Mór mac Eirc</a>, <sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a  title="">[4]</a></sup>. In the reign of <a href="/wiki/Malcolm_III_of_Scotland.html" title="Malcolm III of Scotland">Máel Coluim III</a>, the <i><a href="/wiki/Duan_Albanach.html" title="Duan Albanach">Duan Albanach</a></i> formalised the myth in Gaelic poetic tradition.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a  title="">[5]</a></sup> In the <a href="/wiki/Thirteenth_century.html" title="Thirteenth century">thirteenth</a> and <a href="/wiki/Fourteenth_century.html" title="Fourteenth century">fourteenth</a> centuries, these mythical traditions were incorporated into the documents now in the <a href="/wiki/Poppleton_Manuscript.html" title="Poppleton Manuscript">Poppleton Manuscript</a>, and in the <i><a href="/wiki/Declaration_of_Arbroath.html" title="Declaration of Arbroath">Declaration of Arbroath</a></i>.

<p>King <a href="/wiki/Donald_II_of_Scotland.html" title="Donald II of Scotland">Domnall II</a> was the first man to have been called <i>rí Alban</i> (i.e. <i>King of Alba</i>) when he died at <a href="/wiki/Dunnottar_Castle.html" title="Dunnottar Castle">Dunnottar</a> in 900 <sup id="_ref-albacitation_1" class="reference"><a  title="">[12]</a></sup> - this meant king of Britain or Scotland. All his predecessors bore the style of either <i>King of the Picts</i> or <i>King of Fortriu</i>. Such an apparent innovation in the Gaelic chronicles is occasionally taken to spell the birth of Scotland, but there is nothing special about his reign that might confirm this. Domnall had the nickname <i>dásachtach</i>. This simply meant a madman, or, in early Irish law, a man not in control of his functions and hence without legal culpability.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a  title="">[15]</a></sup> In fact, the long reign (900–942/3) of Domnall's successor <a href="/wiki/Constantine_II_of_Scotland.html" title="Constantine II of Scotland">Causantín</a> is more often regarded as the key to formation of the High Medieval Kingdom of Alba.<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a  title="">[16]</a></sup> Despite some setbacks, it was during his half-century reign that the Scots saw off any danger that the <a href="/wiki/Vikings.html" title="Vikings">Vikings</a> would expand their territory beyond the <a href="/wiki/Outer_Hebrides.html" title="Outer Hebrides">Western</a> and <a href="/wiki/Northern_Isles.html" title="Northern Isles">Northern Isles</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Caithness.html" title="Caithness">Caithness</a> area.</p>
<p>The period between the accession of <a href="/wiki/Malcolm_I_of_Scotland.html" title="Malcolm I of Scotland">Máel Coluim I</a> and <a href="/wiki/Malcolm_II_of_Scotland.html" title="Malcolm II of Scotland">Máel Coluim II</a> was marked by good relations with the <a href="/wiki/Wessex.html" title="Wessex">Wessex</a> <a href="/wiki/Kings_of_England.html" title="Kings of England">rulers of England</a>, intense internal dynastic disunity and, despite this, relatively successful expansionary policies. In 945, king Máel Coluim I received <a href="/wiki/Kingdom_of_Strathclyde.html" title="Kingdom of Strathclyde">Strathclyde</a> as part of a deal with King <a href="/wiki/Edmund_I_of_England.html" title="Edmund I of England">Edmund of England</a>, an event offset somewhat by Máel Coluim's loss of control in Moray.<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a  title="">[17]</a></sup> Sometime in the reign of king <a href="/wiki/Indulf_of_Scotland.html" title="Indulf of Scotland">Idulb</a> (954–962), the Scots captured the fortress called <i>oppidum Eden</i>, i.e. <a href="/wiki/Edinburgh.html" title="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a>.<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a  title="">[18]</a></sup> Scottish control of Lothian was strengthened with Máel Coluim II's victory over the Northumbrians and the Battle of Carham (1018). The Scots had probably had some authority in Strathclyde since the later part of the <a href="/wiki/Ninth_century.html" title="Ninth century">ninth century</a>, but the kingdom kept its own rulers, and it is not clear that the Scots were always strong enough to enforce their authority.<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a  title="">[19]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The reign of King <a href="/wiki/Duncan_I_of_Scotland.html" title="Duncan I of Scotland">Donnchad I</a> from 1034 was marred by failed military adventures, and he was defeated and killed by the <a href="/wiki/Mormaer_of_Moray.html" title="Mormaer of Moray">Mormaer of Moray</a>, <a href="/wiki/Macbeth_of_Scotland.html" title="Macbeth of Scotland">Mac Bethad mac Findláich</a>, who became king in 1040.<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a  title="">[20]</a></sup> Mac Bethad ruled for seventeen years, so peacefully that he was able to leave to go on <a href="/wiki/Pilgrimage.html" title="Pilgrimage">pilgrimage</a> to <a href="/wiki/Rome.html" title="Rome">Rome</a>. However, he was overthrown by <a href="/wiki/Malcolm_III_of_Scotland.html" title="Malcolm III of Scotland">Máel Coluim</a>, the son of Donnchad who eighteen months later defeated Mac Bethad's successor Lulach to become king Máel Coluim III. In subsequent medieval <a href="/wiki/Propaganda.html" title="Propaganda">propaganda</a> Donnchad's reign was portrayed positively, while Mac Bethad was vilified. <a href="/wiki/William_Shakespeare.html" title="William Shakespeare">William Shakespeare</a> followed this distorted history in describing both men in his play <a href="/wiki/Macbeth.html" title="Macbeth">Macbeth</a>.</p>

</div>
<p>It was Máel Coluim III, not his father Donnchad, who did more to create the <a href="/wiki/House_of_Dunkeld.html" title="House of Dunkeld">dynasty</a> that ruled Scotland for the following two centuries, successfully compared to some. Part of the resource was the large number of children he had, perhaps as many as a dozen, through marriage to the widow or daughter of <a href="/wiki/Thorfinn_Sigurdsson%2C_Earl_of_Orkney.html" title="Thorfinn Sigurdsson, Earl of Orkney">Thorfinn Sigurdsson, Earl of Orkney</a> and afterwards to the Anglo-Hungarian princess <a href="/wiki/Saint_Margaret_of_Scotland.html" title="Saint Margaret of Scotland">Margaret</a>, granddaughter of <a href="/wiki/Edmund_Ironside.html" title="Edmund Ironside">Edmund Ironside</a>. However, despite having a royal <a href="/wiki/Anglo-Saxons.html" title="Anglo-Saxons">Anglo-Saxon</a> wife, Máel Coluim spent much of his reign conducting <a href="/wiki/Slavery.html" title="Slavery">slave</a> raids against the English, adding to the woes of that people in the aftermath of the <a href="/wiki/Norman_Conquest_of_England.html" title="Norman Conquest of England">Norman Conquest of England</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Harrying_of_the_North.html" title="Harrying of the North">Harrying of the North</a>. <a href="/wiki/Marianus_Scotus.html" title="Marianus Scotus">Marianus Scotus</a> tells us that "the Gaels and French devastated the English; and [the English] were dispersed and died of hunger; and were compelled to eat human flesh".<sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a  title="">[21]</a></sup></p>
<p>Máel Coluim's raids and attempts to further the claims for his successors to the <a href="/wiki/Kingdom_of_England.html" title="Kingdom of England">English kingdom</a> prompted interference by the Norman rulers of England in the Scottish kingdom. He had married the sister of the native English claimant to the English throne, Edgar Ætheling, and had given most of his children by this marriage Anglo-Saxon royal names. In 1080, King <a href="/wiki/William_I_of_England.html" title="William I of England">William the Conqueror</a> sent his son on an invasion of Scotland, and Máel Coluim submitted to the authority of the king, giving his oldest son Donnchad as a hostage. King Máel Coluim himself died in one of the raids, in 1093.</p>
<p>Tradition would have made his brother <a href="/wiki/Donald_III_of_Scotland.html" title="Donald III of Scotland">Domnall Bán</a> Máel Coluim's successor, but it seems that Edward, his eldest son by Margaret, was his chosen heir. With Máel Coluim and Edward dead in the same battle, and his other sons in Scotland still young, Domnall was made king. However, <a href="/wiki/Duncan_II_of_Scotland.html" title="Duncan II of Scotland">Donnchad II</a>, Máel Coluim's eldest son by his first wife, obtained some support from <a href="/wiki/William_II_of_England.html" title="William II of England">William Rufus</a> and took the throne, but according to the <a href="/wiki/Anglo-Saxon_Chronicle.html" title="Anglo-Saxon Chronicle">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</a> his English and French followers were massacred,<sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a  title="">[22]</a></sup>, and Donnchad II himself was killed later in the same year (1094) by Domnall's ally <a href="/wiki/M%C3%A1el_Petair_of_Mearns.html" title="Máel Petair of Mearns">Máel Petair of Mearns</a>. However, in 1097, William Rufus sent another of Máel Coluim's sons, <a href="/wiki/Edgar_of_Scotland.html" title="Edgar of Scotland">Edgar</a>, to take the kingship. The ensuing death of Domnall Bán secured the kingship for Edgar, and there followed a period of relative peace. The reigns of both Edgar and his successor <a href="/wiki/Alexander_I_of_Scotland.html" title="Alexander I of Scotland">Alexander</a> are obscure in comparison with their successors. The former's most notable act was to send a <a href="/wiki/Camel.html" title="Camel">camel</a> (or perhaps an <a href="/wiki/Elephant.html" title="Elephant">elephant</a>) to his fellow Gael <a href="/wiki/Muircheartach_Ua_Briain.html" title="Muircheartach Ua Briain">Muircheartach Ua Briain</a>, <a href="/wiki/High_King_of_Ireland.html" title="High King of Ireland">High King of Ireland</a>.<sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a  title="">[23]</a></sup> When Edgar died, Alexander took the kingship, while his youngest brother David became Prince of "Cumbria" and ruler of Lothian.</p>

<p>The period between the accession of <a href="/wiki/David_I_of_Scotland.html" title="David I of Scotland">David I</a> and the death of <a href="/wiki/Alexander_III_of_Scotland.html" title="Alexander III of Scotland">Alexander III</a> was marked by dependency upon and relatively good relations with the Kings of the English. As long as one remembers the continuities, the period can also be regarded as one of great historical transformation, part of a more general phenomenon which has been called the "Europeanisation of Europe".<sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a  title="">[24]</a></sup> As a related matter, the period witnessed the successful imposition of royal authority across most of the modern country. After David I, and especially in the reign of <a href="/wiki/William_I_of_Scotland.html" title="William I of Scotland">William I</a>,<sup id="_ref-williamcitation_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[25]</a></sup> Scotland's Kings became ambivalent about the culture of most of their subjects. As <a href="/wiki/Walter_of_Coventry.html" title="Walter of Coventry">Walter of Coventry</a> tells us that "The modern kings of Scotland count themselves as Frenchmen, in race, manners, language and culture; they keep only Frenchmen in their household and following, and have reduced the Scots [=Gaels] to utter servitude."<sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a  title="">[26]</a></sup></p>
<p>The ambivalence of the kings was matched to a certain extent by the Scots themselves. In the aftermath of William's capture at <a href="/wiki/Alnwick.html" title="Alnwick">Alnwick</a> in 1174, the Scots turned on the small number of <a href="/wiki/Middle_English.html" title="Middle English">Middle English</a>-speakers and French-speakers among them. <a href="/wiki/William_of_Newburgh.html" title="William of Newburgh">William of Newburgh</a> related that the Scots first attacked the Scoto-English in their own army, and Newburgh reported a repetition of these events in Scotland itself.<sup id="_ref-24" class="reference"><a  title="">[27]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Walter_Bower.html" title="Walter Bower">Walter Bower</a>, writing a few centuries later albeit, wrote about the same events, and confirms that "there took place a most wretched and widespread persecution of the English both in Scotland and Galloway".<sup id="_ref-25" class="reference"><a  title="">[28]</a></sup></p>

</div>
<p>Opposition to the Scottish kings in this period was indeed hard. The first instance is perhaps the revolt of <a href="/wiki/%C3%93engus_of_Moray.html" title="Óengus of Moray">Óengus</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Mormaer_of_Moray.html" title="Mormaer of Moray">Mormaer of Moray</a>.

The MacWilliams appear to have rebelled for no less a reason than the Scottish throne itself. The threat was so grave that, after the defeat of the MacWilliams in 1230, the Scottish crown ordered the public execution of the infant girl who happened to be the last of the MacWilliam line. This was how the <i>Lanercost Chronicle</i> related the fate of this last MacWilliam:</p>
<div class="notice spoilerbox">

<div class="toccolours spoilercontents">
<p>"the same Mac-William's daughter, who had not long left her mother's womb, innocent as she was, was put to death, in the burgh of Forfar, in view of the market place, after a proclamation by the public crier.

</div>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
<p>Many of these resistors collaborated, and drew support not just in the peripheral Gaelic regions of Galloway, Moray, Ross and Argyll, but also from eastern "Scotland-proper", and elsewhere in the Gaelic world. However, by the end of the <a href="/wiki/Twelfth_century.html" title="Twelfth century">twelfth century</a>, the Scottish kings had acquired the authority and ability to draw in native Gaelic lords outside their previous zone of control in order to do their work, the most famous examples being <a href="/wiki/Lochlann%2C_Lord_of_Galloway.html" title="Lochlann, Lord of Galloway">Lochlann, Lord of Galloway</a> and <a href="/wiki/Fearchar%2C_Earl_of_Ross.html" title="Fearchar, Earl of Ross">Ferchar mac in tSagairt</a>. Cumulatively, by the reign of Alexander III, the Scots were in a strong position to annex the remainder of the western seaboard, which they did in 1265, with the <a href="/wiki/Treaty_of_Perth.html" title="Treaty of Perth">Treaty of Perth</a>. The conquest of the west, the creation of the Mormaerdom of Carrick in 1186 and the absorption of the <a href="/wiki/Lords_of_Galloway.html" title="Lords of Galloway">Lordship of Galloway</a> after the Galwegian revolt of <a href="/wiki/Gille_Ruadh.html" title="Gille Ruadh">Gille Ruadh</a> in 1235 meant that the number and proportion of Gaelic speakers under the rule of the Scottish king actually increased, and perhaps even doubled, in the so-called Norman period. It was the Gaels and Gaelicised warriors of the new west, and the power they offered, that enabled King <a href="/wiki/Robert_I_of_Scotland.html" title="Robert I of Scotland">Robert I</a> (himself a Gaelicised <a href="/wiki/Scoto-Norman.html" title="Scoto-Norman">Scoto-Norman</a> of <a href="/wiki/Carrick%2C_Scotland.html" title="Carrick, Scotland">Carrick</a>) to emerge victorious during the <a href="/wiki/Scottish_Wars_of_Independence.html" title="Scottish Wars of Independence">Wars of Independence</a>, which followed soon after the death of Alexander III.</p>

In fact, until the Norman era, and perhaps even until the reign of Alexander II, the Scottish king controlled only a minority of the people who lived inside the boundary of modern Scotland, in the same way as the <a href="/wiki/French_monarchs.html" title="French monarchs">French monarchs</a> of the Middle Ages only had control of patches of what is now modern <a href="/wiki/France.html" title="France">France</a>. The <a href="/wiki/Mormaer_of_Moray.html" title="Mormaer of Moray">ruler of Moray</a> was called not only <i>king</i> in both Scandinavian sources, but before <a href="/wiki/M%C3%A1el_Snechtai_of_Moray.html" title="Máel Snechtai of Moray">Máel Snechtai</a>, <i>king of Alba/Scotland</i>.<sup id="_ref-28" class="reference"><a  title="">[31]</a></sup> After Máel Snechtai, Irish sources call them merely kings of <a href="/wiki/Moray.html" title="Moray">Moray</a>. The rulers of Moray in fact took over the entire Scottish kingdom in 1040, under the famous <a href="/wiki/Macbeth_of_Scotland.html" title="Macbeth of Scotland">Mac Bethad mac Findláich</a> (1040–<a href="/wiki/1057.html" title="1057">1057</a>) and his successor <a href="/wiki/Lulach_of_Scotland.html" title="Lulach of Scotland">Lulach mac Gillai Coemgáin</a> (1057–<a href="/wiki/1058.html" title="1058">1058</a>). However, Moray was subjugated by the Scottish kings after 1130, when the last native ruler, <a href="/wiki/%C3%93engus_of_Moray.html" title="Óengus of Moray">Óengus of Moray</a> was defeated in an attempt to seize the Scottish throne.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Galloway.html" title="Galloway">Galloway</a>, likewise, was a Lordship with some regality. In a Galwegian charter dated to the reign of <a href="/wiki/Fergus_of_Galloway.html" title="Fergus of Galloway">Fergus</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Galwegian_Gaelic.html" title="Galwegian Gaelic">Galwegian</a> ruler styled himself <i>rex Galwitensium</i>, King of Galloway.<sup id="_ref-29" class="reference"><a  title="">[32]</a></sup> We know that Irish chroniclers continued to call Fergus' successors <i>King</i>. Although the Scots obtained greater control after the death of <a href="/wiki/Gille_Brigte%2C_Lord_of_Galloway.html" title="Gille Brigte, Lord of Galloway">Gilla Brigte</a> and the installation of <a href="/wiki/Lochlann%2C_Lord_of_Galloway.html" title="Lochlann, Lord of Galloway">Lochlann/Roland</a> in 1185, Galloway was not in fact fully absorbed by Scotland until 1235, after the <a href="/wiki/Gilla_Ruadh_the_Galwegian.html" title="Gilla Ruadh the Galwegian">rebellion of the Galwegians</a> was crushed.</p>
<p>Galloway and Moray were not the only other territories whose rulers had regal status. Both the rulers of <a href="/wiki/Isle_of_Man.html" title="Isle of Man">Mann</a> &amp; the <a href="/wiki/Hebrides.html" title="Hebrides">Isles</a>, and the rulers of Argyll had the status of kings, even if some southern Latin writers called them merely <i>reguli</i> (i.e. "kinglets"). The <a href="/wiki/Mormaer_of_Lennox.html" title="Mormaer of Lennox">Mormaers of Lennox</a> referred to their predecessors as Kings of <a href="/wiki/Balloch.html" title="Balloch">Balloch</a>, and indeed many of the Mormaerdoms had been kingdoms at an earlier stage. Another kingdom, <a href="/wiki/Kingdom_of_Strathclyde.html" title="Kingdom of Strathclyde">Strathclyde</a> (or <i>Cumbria</i>), had been incorporated into Scotland in a slow process that started in the <a href="/wiki/Ninth_century.html" title="Ninth century">ninth century</a> and was not fully realized until the <a href="/wiki/Eleventh_century.html" title="Eleventh century">eleventh</a>.</p>

<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Neither the political nor the theoretical boundaries of Scotland in this period, as both <a href="/wiki/Alba.html" title="Alba">Alba</a> and <a href="/wiki/Scotia.html" title="Scotia">Scotia</a>, corresponded exactly to modern Scotland. The closest approximation came at the end of the period, when the <a href="/wiki/Treaty_of_York.html" title="Treaty of York">Treaty of York</a> (1237) and <a href="/wiki/Treaty_of_Perth.html" title="Treaty of Perth">Treaty of Perth</a> (1266) fixed the boundaries between the Kingdom of the Scots with England and <a href="/wiki/Norway.html" title="Norway">Norway</a> respectively; although in neither case did this border exactly match the modern one, <a href="/wiki/Berwick.html" title="Berwick">Berwick</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Isle_of_Man.html" title="Isle of Man">Isle of Man</a> being eventually lost to England, and <a href="/wiki/Orkney.html" title="Orkney">Orkney</a> and <a href="/wiki/Shetland.html" title="Shetland">Shetland</a> later being gained from Norway.</p>
<p>Until the <a href="/wiki/Thirteenth_century.html" title="Thirteenth century">thirteenth century</a>, Scotland referred to the land to the north of the <a href="/wiki/River_Forth.html" title="River Forth">river Forth</a>, and for this reason historians sometimes use the term "Scotland-proper". By the middle of the thirteenth century, Scotland could include all the lands ruled by the King of Scots, but the older concept of Scotland remained throughout the period.</p>
<p>For legal and administrative purposes, the Kingdom of the Scots was divided into three, four or five zones: Scotland-proper (north and south of the <a href="/wiki/Grampians.html" title="Grampians">Grampians</a>), <a href="/wiki/Lothian.html" title="Lothian">Lothian</a>, <a href="/wiki/Galloway.html" title="Galloway">Galloway</a> and, earlier, <a href="/wiki/Strathclyde.html" title="Strathclyde">Strathclyde</a>. Like Scotland, neither Lothian nor Galloway had its modern meaning. Lothian could refer to the entire <a href="/wiki/Middle_English.html" title="Middle English">Middle English</a>-speaking south-east, and latterly, included much of Strathclyde. Galloway could refer to the entire Gaelic-speaking south-west. Lothian was divided from Scotland-proper by the river Forth.

<p>Most of Scotland's agricultural wealth in this period came from <a href="/wiki/Pastoralism.html" title="Pastoralism">pastoralism</a>, rather than <a href="/wiki/Arable_land.html" title="Arable land">arable farming</a>.

<p>Pre-Davidian Scotland had no towns.

Scotland, outside Lothian at least, was populated by scattered hamlets, and outside that area, lacked the continental style nucleated village. David I established the first burghs in Scotland, initially only in <a href="/wiki/Middle_English_language.html" title="Middle English language">English</a>-speaking Lothian. David I copied the burgher charters and <i>Leges Burgorum</i> (rules governing virtually every aspect of life and work in a burgh) almost verbatim from the English customs of <a href="/wiki/Newcastle-Upon-Tyne.html" title="Newcastle-Upon-Tyne">Newcastle-Upon-Tyne</a>.<sup id="_ref-39" class="reference"><a  title="">[42]</a></sup> Early burgesses were usually <a href="/wiki/Flemings.html" title="Flemings">Flemish</a>, <a href="/wiki/English_people.html" title="English people">English</a>, <a href="/wiki/French_people.html" title="French people">French</a> and <a href="/wiki/Germans.html" title="Germans">German</a>, rather than Gaelic Scots.

</div>
</div>
<p>The population of Scotland in this period is unknown. Not until 1755 do we get reliable information about the population of Scotland, when it was 1,265,380. However, best estimates put the Scottish population in this period between 500,000 and 1,000,000 people, growing from a low point to a high point.<sup id="_ref-42" class="reference"><a  title="">[45]</a></sup> This population was much more evenly spread than today. We can estimate that between 60 and 80% of people lived north of the Forth river, with the remainder being divided between Galloway, Strathclyde and Lothian. Bishopric and Justiciar distribution suggests a relatively even divide between these three zones.</p>
<p>Linguistically, the vast majority of people within Scotland throughout this period spoke the <a href="/wiki/Middle_Irish_language.html" title="Middle Irish language">Gaelic</a> language, then simply called <i>Scottish</i>, or in Latin, <i>lingua Scotica</i>.<sup id="_ref-43" class="reference"><a  title="">[46]</a></sup> Other languages spoken throughout this period were Norse and English, with the <a href="/wiki/Cumbric_language.html" title="Cumbric language">Cumbric language</a> disappearing somewhere between 900 and 1100. Pictish may have survived into this period, but there is little evidence for this. After the accession of <a href="/wiki/David_I_of_Scotland.html" title="David I of Scotland">David I</a>, or perhaps before, Gaelic ceased to be the main language of the royal court. From his reign until the end of the period, the Scottish monarchs probably favoured the French language, as evidenced by reports from contemporary chronicles, literature and translations of administrative documents into the French language. English, with French and Flemish, became the main language of Scottish towns (<a href="/wiki/Burgh.html" title="Burgh">burghs</a>), which were created for the first time under David I. However, burghs were, in Barrow's words, “scarcely more than villages … numbered in hundreds rather than thousands”,<sup id="_ref-44" class="reference"><a  title="">[47]</a></sup> and Norman knights were a similarly tiny in number when compared with the Gaelic population of Scotland outside of Lothian.</p>

<p>Medieval Scottish society was stratified. We know more about <a href="/wiki/Status.html" title="Status">status</a> in early Gaelic society than perhaps any other early medieval European society, owing primarily to the large body of legal texts and tracts on status which are extant.<sup id="_ref-45" class="reference"><a  title="">[48]</a></sup> The legal tract that has come down to us as the <i>Laws of Brets and Scots</i>, lists five grades of man: King, <a href="/wiki/Mormaer.html" title="Mormaer">mormaer</a>/<a href="/wiki/Earl.html" title="Earl">earl</a>, <i>toísech</i>/thane, <i>ócthigern</i> and serf.<sup id="_ref-46" class="reference"><a  title="">[49]</a></sup> For pre-<a href="/wiki/Twelfth_century.html" title="Twelfth century">twelfth century</a> Scotland, we should add slave to this category. The standard differentiation in medieval European society between the <i>bellatores</i> ("those who fight", i.e. aristocrats), the <i>oratores</i> ("those who pray", i.e. clergy) and the <i>laboratores</i> ("those who work", i.e. peasants) was useless for understanding Scottish society in the earlier period, but becomes more useful in the post-Davidian period.</p>
<p>Most of the territory subject to the King of Scots <a href="/wiki/Scotia.html" title="Scotia">north of the Forth</a> was directly under a lord who in <a href="/wiki/Middle_Irish_language.html" title="Middle Irish language">medieval Scottish</a> was called a <a href="/wiki/Mormaer.html" title="Mormaer">Mormaer</a>. The term was translated into Latin as <i>comes</i>, and is misleadingly translated into modern English as <a href="/wiki/Earl.html" title="Earl">Earl</a>. These secular lords exercised secular power and religious patronage like kings in miniature. They kept their own warbands and followers, issued charters and supervised law and internal order within their provinces. When actually under the power of the Scottish king, they were responsible for rendering to the king <i>cain</i>, a tribute paid several times a year, usually in cattle and other barter goods. They also had to provide for the king <i>conveth</i>, a kind of hospitality payment, paid by putting-up the lord on a visit with food and accommodation, or with barter payments in lieu of this. In the Norman era, they provided the <i>servitum Scoticanum</i> ("Gaelic service", "Scottish service" or simply <i>forinsec</i>) and led the <i>exercitus Scoticanus</i> , the Gaelic part of the king's army that made up the vast majority almost any national <a href="/wiki/Hosting.html" title="Hosting">hosting</a> (<i>slógad</i>) in the period.</p>

<p>A <i>toísech</i> ("chieftain") was like a mormaer, providing for his lord the same services that a mormaer provided for the king. The Latin word usually used is <i>thanus</i>, which is why the office-bearers are often called "thanes" in English. The formalization of this institution was largely confined to eastern Scotland north of the Forth, and only two of the seventy-one known thanages existed south of that river.<sup id="_ref-47" class="reference"><a  title="">[50]</a></sup> Behind the offices of <i>toísech</i> and mormaer were <a href="/wiki/Clan.html" title="Clan">kinship groups</a>. Sometimes these offices were formalized, but mostly they are informal. The head of the kinship group was called <i>capitalis</i> in Latin and <i>cenn</i> in <a href="/wiki/Middle_Irish_language.html" title="Middle Irish language">medieval Gaelic</a>. In the <a href="/wiki/Mormaerdom_of_Fife.html" title="Mormaerdom of Fife">Mormaerdom of Fife</a>, the primary kinship group was known then as <i>Clann MacDuib</i> ("Children of <a href="/wiki/Clan_MacDuff.html" title="Clan MacDuff">MacDuff</a>"). Others include the <i>Cennedig</i> (from <a href="/wiki/Carrick%2C_Scotland.html" title="Carrick, Scotland">Carrick</a>), <i>Morggain</i> (from <a href="/wiki/Buchan.html" title="Buchan">Buchan</a>), and the MacDowalls (from <a href="/wiki/Galloway.html" title="Galloway">Galloway</a>). There were probably hundreds in total, mostly unrecorded.</p>
<p>The highest non-noble rank was, according to the <i>Laws of Brets and Scots</i>, called the <i>ócthigern</i> (literally, <i>little</i> or <i>young lord</i>), a term the text does not bother to translate into French. The Anglo-Saxon equivalent was perhaps the <i>sokeman</i>. Other known ranks include the <i>scoloc</i>, perhaps equivalent to the <a href="/wiki/Anglo-Saxon_language.html" title="Anglo-Saxon language">Anglo-Saxon</a> <i>gerseman</i>.<sup id="_ref-48" class="reference"><a  title="">[51]</a></sup> In the earlier period, the Scots kept slaves, and many of these were foreigners (English or Scandinavian) captured during warfare.

<p>A <i>Judex</i> (pl. <i>judices</i>) represents a post-Norman continuity with the ancient Gaelic orders of lawmen called in English today <i>Brehons</i>. Bearers of the office almost always have Gaelic names north of the Forth or in the <a href="/wiki/Galloway.html" title="Galloway">south-west</a>. <i>Judices</i> were often royal officials who supervised baronial, abbatial and other lower-ranking "courts". <sup id="_ref-52" class="reference"><a  title="">[55]</a></sup> However, the main official of law in the post-Davidian Kingdom of the Scots was the <a href="/wiki/Justiciar.html" title="Justiciar">Justiciar</a>. The institution has Anglo-Norman origins, but in Scotland north of the Forth it probably represented some form of continuity with an older office. For instance, Mormaer <a href="/wiki/Causant%C3%ADn_of_Fife.html" title="Causantín of Fife">Causantín of Fife</a> is styled <i>judex magnus</i> (i.e. great Brehon), and it seems that the Justiciarship of Scotia was just a further Latinisation/Normanisation of that position. The formalized office of the Justiciar held resonsibility for supervising the activity and behaviour of royal sheriffs and sergeants, held courts and reported on these things to the king personally. Normally, there were two Justiciarships, organized by linguistic boundaries: the Justiciar of <a href="/wiki/Scotia.html" title="Scotia">Scotia</a> and the Justiciar of <a href="/wiki/Lothian.html" title="Lothian">Lothian</a>. Sometimes Galloway had its own Justiciar too.<sup id="_ref-53" class="reference"><a  title="">[56]</a></sup></p>
<p>The office of Justiciar and Judex were just two ways that Scottish society was governed. In the earlier period, the king "delegated" power to hereditary native "officers" such as the Mormaers/Earls and Toísechs/Thanes. It was a <a href="/wiki/Government.html" title="Government">government</a> of gift-giving and bardic lawmen. There were also popular courts, the <i>comhdhail</i>, testament to which are dozens of placenames throughout eastern Scotland.<sup id="_ref-54" class="reference"><a  title="">[57]</a></sup> In the Norman period, sheriffdoms and sherrifs and, to a lesser extent, bishops (see <a href="/wiki/Scotland_in_the_High_Middle_Ages#Ecclesia_Scoticana.html" title="Scotland in the High Middle Ages">below</a>) became increasingly important. The former enabled the King to effectively administer royal demesne land. During David I's reign, royal sheriffs had been established in the king's core personal territories; namely, in rough chronological order, at <a href="/wiki/Roxburgh.html" title="Roxburgh">Roxburgh</a>, <a href="/wiki/Scone.html" title="Scone">Scone</a>, <a href="/wiki/Berwick-upon-Tweed.html" title="Berwick-upon-Tweed">Berwick-upon-Tweed</a>, <a href="/wiki/Stirling.html" title="Stirling">Stirling</a> and <a href="/wiki/Perth%2C_Scotland.html" title="Perth, Scotland">Perth</a>.<sup id="_ref-55" class="reference"><a  title="">[58]</a></sup> By the reign of <a href="/wiki/William_I_of_Scotland.html" title="William I of Scotland">William I</a>, there may have been about 30 royal sheriffdoms, including ones at <a href="/wiki/Ayr.html" title="Ayr">Ayr</a> and <a href="/wiki/Dumfries.html" title="Dumfries">Dumfries</a>, key locations on the borders of <a href="/wiki/Galloway.html" title="Galloway">Galloway</a>-<a href="/wiki/Carrick%2C_Scotland.html" title="Carrick, Scotland">Carrick</a>.<sup id="_ref-56" class="reference"><a  title="">[59]</a></sup> As the distribution and number of sheriffdoms expanded, so did royal control.

The king himself was itinerant and had no "capital"; but if there was such a thing, it was Scone. By ritual tradition, all Scottish kings in this period had to be crowned there, and crowned there by the <a href="/wiki/Mormaer_of_Strathearn.html" title="Mormaer of Strathearn">Mormaers of Strathearn</a> and, especially, <a href="/wiki/Mormaer_of_Fife.html" title="Mormaer of Fife">Fife</a>.<sup id="_ref-fifecitation_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[60]</a></sup> Although King David I tried to build up Roxburgh as a capital,<sup id="_ref-fifecitation_1" class="reference"><a  title="">[60]</a></sup> in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, more charters were issued at Scone than any other location.

<p>After the "Norman Conquest" of David I, the warriors of Scotland can be classed as of two types. Firstly, the native <i>exercitus Scoticanus</i> (i.e. "Gaelic army"); and, secondly, the <i>exercitus militaris</i> (i.e. "feudal army"). The Gaelic army formed the larger part of all pre-Stewart Scottish armies, but in the wider world of European (i.e. French) chivalry the feudal section was the more prestigious. The native Scots, like all early medieval Europeans, practiced organized <a href="/wiki/Slavery.html" title="Slavery">slave</a>-raiding. Presumably, they did so with each other. However, our main record of it comes from when they practised it against their Norman and post-Conquest Anglo-Saxon neighbour. John Gillingham argues that this was one of the things which made the Scots (and other Celts) particularly barbarous in the eyes of their "Frankish" neighbours, because the French had largely abandoned this form of warfare.<sup id="_ref-59" class="reference"><a  title="">[63]</a></sup></p>

<p>As with so many changes in this period, the introduction of the feudal army can be traced primarily to the reign of David I, although French and English knights were used in moderation by his older brothers. The tension which these knights produced is well recorded in contemporary sources. At the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_the_Standard.html" title="Battle of the Standard">Battle of the Standard</a>, the Gaels oppose the positioning of the French soldiers in the van of the king's army. <a href="/wiki/Ailred_of_Rievaulx.html" title="Ailred of Rievaulx">Ailred of Rievaulx</a> attributes this opposition to the Galwegians, but we know it was the Scottish Gaels in general, as the native spokesman is given as <a href="/wiki/M%C3%A1el_%C3%8Dsu_I_of_Strathearn.html" title="Máel Ísu I of Strathearn">Máel Ísu</a> , then the <a href="/wiki/Mormaer_of_Strathearn.html" title="Mormaer of Strathearn">Mormaer of Strathearn</a> and highest ranking noble in the army.<sup id="_ref-60" class="reference"><a  title="">[64]</a></sup></p>
<p>The advantage French military culture possessed was manifold. French knights used expensive suits of armour, whereas the Scots were "naked" (of armour, rather than dress). They possessed heavy cavalry, and other weapons such as crossbows and siege engines, as well as fortification techniques far more effective and advanced than anything possessed by the native Scots. Moreover, their culture, particularly their feudal ideology, made them reliable vassals, who because they were foreign, were even more dependent on the king. Over time, the Scots themselves became more like the French warriors, and the French warriors adopted many of the Gaelic military practices, so that by the end of the period, a syncretic military culture existed in the kingdom. When the feudal army was destroyed at the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Dunbar_%281296%29.html" title="Battle of Dunbar (1296)">Battle of Dunbar (1296)</a>, the Scots were dependent once again on the Gaelic army. However, owing to two centuries of adaptation and the leadership of the Gaelic-speaking <a href="/wiki/Scoto-Norman.html" title="Scoto-Norman">Scoto-Norman</a> <a href="/wiki/Robert_I_of_Scotland.html" title="Robert I of Scotland">Robert Bruce</a>, this army was able to defeat the attempted takeover by the English-crown.</p>

<p>Like every other Christian country, one of the main features of Scottish Christianity is the <a href="/wiki/Saint.html" title="Saint">Cult of Saints</a>. Saints were the middle men between the ordinary worshipper and <a href="/wiki/God.html" title="God">God</a>. In Scotland north of the <a href="/wiki/River_Forth.html" title="River Forth">Forth</a>, local saints were either Pictish or Gaelic. The national saint of the Scottish Gaels was <i>Colum Cille</i> or <a href="/wiki/Columba.html" title="Columba">Columba</a> (in Latin, lit. <i>dove</i>), in Strathclyde it was <a href="/wiki/St_Kentigern.html" title="St Kentigern">St Kentigern</a> (in Gaelic, lit. <i>Chief of the Lord</i>), in Lothian, <a href="/wiki/St_Cuthbert.html" title="St Cuthbert">St Cuthbert</a>. Later, owing to learned confusion between the Latin words <a href="/wiki/Scotia.html" title="Scotia">Scotia</a> and <a href="/wiki/Scythia.html" title="Scythia">Scythia</a>, the Scottish kings adopted <a href="/wiki/St_Andrew.html" title="St Andrew">St Andrew</a>, a saint who had more appeal to incoming Normans and was attached to the ambitious bishopric that is now known by the saint's name, St Andrews. However, Columba's status was still supreme in the early <a href="/wiki/Fourteenth_century.html" title="Fourteenth century">fourteenth century</a>, when King <a href="/wiki/Robert_I_of_Scotland.html" title="Robert I of Scotland">Robert I</a> carried the <i>brecbennoch</i> (or Monymusk reliquary) into battle at <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Bannockburn.html" title="Battle of Bannockburn">Bannockburn</a>. Around the same period, a cleric on <a href="/wiki/Inchcolm.html" title="Inchcolm">Inchcolm</a> wrote the following Latin poem:</p>

<h3>Monasticism</h3>
<p>The typical features of native Scottish Christianity are relaxed ideas of <a href="/wiki/Clerical_celibacy.html" title="Clerical celibacy">clerical celibacy</a>, intense secularization of ecclesiastical institutions, and the lack of a <a href="/wiki/Bishopric.html" title="Bishopric">dioscesan structure</a>. Instead of bishops and archbishops, the most important offices of the native Scottish church were <a href="/wiki/Abbot.html" title="Abbot">abbots</a> (or <i>coarbs</i>). Scotland was untouched by continental forms of <a href="/wiki/Monasticism.html" title="Monasticism">monasticism</a> until the late <a href="/wiki/Eleventh_century.html" title="Eleventh century">eleventh century</a>. Instead, monasticism was dominated by <a href="/wiki/Monks.html" title="Monks">monks</a> called <i>Céli Dé</i> (lit. "vassals of God"), anglicised as <a href="/wiki/Culdees.html" title="Culdees">culdees</a>. In most cases, these monks were not replaced by new continental monks in the Norman period, but usually survived, even gaining the patronage of Queen Margaret, a figure traditionally seen as hostile to Gaelic culture. At St Andrews, the <i>Céli Dé</i> establishment endured throughout the period, and even enjoyed rights over the election of its bishop. In fact, Gaelic monasticism was vibrant and expansionary for much of the period. For instance, dozens of monasteries, often called <a href="/wiki/Schottenkl%C3%B6ster.html" title="Schottenklöster">Schottenklöster</a>, were founded by Gaelic monks on the continent, and many Scottish monks, such as <a  class="new" title="St Cathróe of Metz">St Cathróe of Metz</a>, became local saints.</p>

<h3>Ecclesia Scoticana</h3>
<p>The <i>Ecclesia Scoticana</i> (lit. <i>Scottish church</i>) as a system has no known starting point, although <a href="/wiki/Constantine_II_of_Scotland.html" title="Constantine II of Scotland">Causantín II</a>'s alleged <a href="/wiki/Scoticisation.html" title="Scoticisation">Scoticisation</a> of the "Pictish" Church might be taken as one. Before the Norman period, Scotland had little dioscesan structure, being primarily monastic after the fashion of Ireland. After the <a href="/wiki/Norman_Conquest_of_England.html" title="Norman Conquest of England">Norman Conquest of England</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Archbishop.html" title="Archbishop">Archbishops</a> of both Canterbury and York each claimed superiority over the Scottish church.

However, unlike Ireland which had been granted four Archbishoprics in the same century, Scotland received no Archbishop and the whole <i>Ecclesia Scoticana</i>, with individual Scottish bishoprics (except Whithorn/Galloway), became the "special daughter of Rome". The following is a table of Bishoprics present in "Scotland-proper" in the thirteenth century:</p>

<p>As a predominantly Gaelic society, most Scottish cultural practices throughout this period mirrored closely those of <a href="/wiki/Ireland.html" title="Ireland">Ireland</a>, or at least those of Ireland with some Pictish borrowings. After David I, the French-speaking kings introduced cultural practices popular in Anglo-Norman England, France and elsewhere. As in all pre-modern societies, storytelling was popular. In the words of D.D.R. Owen, a scholar who specialises in the literature of the era, writes that "Professional storytellers would ply their trade from court to court. Some of them would have been native Scots, no doubt offering legends from the ancient Celtic past performed ... in Gaelic when appropriate, but in French for most of the new nobility"<sup id="_ref-62" class="reference"><a  title="">[66]</a></sup> Almost all of these stories are lost, or come down only vaguely in Gaelic or <a href="/wiki/Scots_language.html" title="Scots language">Scots</a> oral tradition. One form of oral culture extremely well accounted for in this period is <a href="/wiki/Genealogy.html" title="Genealogy">genealogy</a>. There are dozens of Scottish genealogies surviving from this era, covering everyone from the <a href="/wiki/Mormaer_of_Lennox.html" title="Mormaer of Lennox">Mormaers of Lennox</a> and <a href="/wiki/Mormaer_of_Moray.html" title="Mormaer of Moray">Moray</a>, to the Scottish king himself. Scotland's kings maintained an <i><a  class="new" title="Ollamh righe">ollamh righe</a></i>, a royal high poet who had a permanent place in all medieval Gaelic lordships, and whose purpose was to recite genealogies when needed, for occasions such as coronations.<sup id="_ref-63" class="reference"><a  title="">[67]</a></sup></p>

<p>Before the reign of David I, the Scots possessed a flourishing literary elite who regularly produced texts in both Gaelic and Latin that were frequently transmitted to Ireland and elsewhere. Dauvit Broun has shown that a Gaelic literary elite survived in the eastern Scottish lowlands, in places such as <a href="/wiki/Loch_Leven.html" title="Loch Leven">Loch Leven</a> and <a href="/wiki/Brechin.html" title="Brechin">Brechin</a> into the <a href="/wiki/Thirteenth_century.html" title="Thirteenth century">thirteenth century</a>,<sup id="_ref-64" class="reference"><a  title="">[68]</a></sup> However, the records which have come down to us are predominantly written in Latin, and their authors would usually translate vernacular terms into Latin, so that historians are faced with a Gaelic society clothed in Latin terminology. Even names were translated into more common continental forms; for instance, <i>Gilla Brigte</i> became <i>Gilbert</i>, <i>Áed</i> became <i>Hugh</i>, etc. <sup id="_ref-65" class="reference"><a  title="">[69]</a></sup> As far as written literature is concerned, there may be more medieval Scottish Gaelic literature than is often thought. Almost all medieval Gaelic literature has survived because it has been allowed to survive in <a href="/wiki/Ireland.html" title="Ireland">Ireland</a>, not in Scotland. Thomas Owen Clancy has recently all but proven that the <i><a  class="new" title="Lebor Bretnach">Lebor Bretnach</a></i>, the so-called "Irish Nennius," was written in Scotland, and probably at the monastery in Abernethy. Yet this text survives only from manuscripts preserved in Ireland.<sup id="_ref-66" class="reference"><a  title="">[70]</a></sup> Other literary work which has survived includes that of the prolific poet <a href="/wiki/Gille_Brighde_Albanach.html" title="Gille Brighde Albanach">Gille Brighde Albanach</a>. About 1218, Gille Brighde wrote a poem — <i>Heading for Damietta</i> — on his experiences of the <a href="/wiki/Fifth_Crusade.html" title="Fifth Crusade">Fifth Crusade</a>. <sup id="_ref-67" class="reference"><a  title="">[71]</a></sup> In the <a href="/wiki/Thirteenth_century.html" title="Thirteenth century">thirteenth century</a>, <a href="/wiki/Old_French_language.html" title="Old French language">French</a> flourished as a <a href="/wiki/Literary_language.html" title="Literary language">literary language</a>, and produced the <i><a href="/wiki/Roman_de_Fergus.html" title="Roman de Fergus">Roman de Fergus</a></i>, the earliest piece of non-Celtic <a href="/wiki/Vernacular.html" title="Vernacular">vernacular</a> literature to survived from Scotland.

<p>In the Middle Ages, Scotland, perhaps more than any country in Europe, was renowned for its musical skill. Gerald of Wales tells us that:</p>
<div class="notice spoilerbox">

<div class="toccolours spoilercontents">
<p>"Scotland, because of her affinity and intercourse [with Ireland], tries to imitate Ireland in music and strives in emulation. Ireland uses and delights in two instruments only, the harp namely, and the tympanum. Scotland uses three, the harp, the tympanum and the crowd. In the opinion, however, of many, Scotland has by now not only caught up on Ireland, her instructor, but already far outdistances her and excels her in musical skill. Therefore, [Irish] people now look to that country as the fountain of the art."<sup id="_ref-68" class="reference"><a  title="">[72]</a></sup></p>

<p>The medieval Scots indeed took harping very seriously. We know that, even half a century after Gerald was writing, King Alexander III kept a royal harpist. Of the three mediaeval harps that survive, two come from Scotland (Perthshire), and one from Ireland. Singers also had a royal function. For instance, when the king of Scotland passed through the territory of Strathearn, it was the custom that he be greeted by seven female singers, who would sing to him. When Edward I approached the borders of Strathearn in the summer of 1296, he was met by these seven women, "who accompanied the King on the road between <a  class="new" title="Gask">Gask</a> and <a href="/wiki/Ogilvie.html" title="Ogilvie">Ogilvie</a>, singing to him, as was the custom in the time of the late Alexander kings of Scots". <sup id="_ref-69" class="reference"><a  title="">[73]</a></sup></p>

<h2>Outsiders' view</h2>
<p>The Irish thought of Scotland as a provincial place. Others thought of it as an outlandish or barbaric place. To the Holy Roman Emperor <a href="/wiki/Frederick_II%2C_Holy_Roman_Emperor.html" title="Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor">Friedrich II</a>, Scotland was associated with having many lakes; to the Arabs, it was an uninhabited peninsula to the north of England.</p>
<p>"Who would deny that the Scots are barbarians?" was a rhetorical question posed by the author of the <i>De expugnatione Lyxbonensi</i> (i.e. "<i>On the Conquest of Lisbon</i>").<sup id="_ref-70" class="reference"><a  title="">[74]</a></sup> A century later <a href="/wiki/St_Louis.html" title="St Louis">St Louis</a> of France was reported to have said to his son “I would prefer that a Scot should come from Scotland and govern the people well and faithfully, than that you, my son, should be seen to govern badly”.<sup id="_ref-71" class="reference"><a  title="">[75]</a></sup> To their English-speaking and French-speaking neighbours, the Scots, especially the <a href="/wiki/Galwegian.html" title="Galwegian">Galwegians</a>, became the barbarians <i>par excellence</i>. After David I this ceased to be applied to their rulers, but the term <i>barbarus</i> was used to describe the Scots, as well as a large number of other European peoples, throughout the High Middle Ages. This characterisation of the Scots was often politically motivated, and many of the most hostile writers were based in areas frequently subjected to Scottish raids. English and French accounts of the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_the_Standard.html" title="Battle of the Standard">Battle of the Standard</a> contain many accounts of Scottish atrocities. For instance, <a href="/wiki/Henry_of_Huntingdon.html" title="Henry of Huntingdon">Henry of Huntingdon</a> tells us that the Scots:</p>
<div class="notice spoilerbox">

<p>"cleft open pregnant women, and took out the unborn babes; they tossed children upon the spear-points, and beheaded priests on altars: they cut the head of crucifixes, and placed them on the trunks of the slain; and placed the heads of the dead upon the crucifixes. Thus wherever the Scots arrived, all was full of horror and full of savagery".<sup id="_ref-72" class="reference"><a  title="">[76]</a></sup>,</p>

<p>In many ways, these accounts tell us merely that in the Frankish cultural milieu, the Scots were seen as outsiders. Moreover, the fact that outlandishness did not apply to the new feudal elite meant that by the end of the period, the Scottish aristocrat was seen as little different from his English or French equivalent.</p>

<h2>National identity</h2>
<p>In this period, the word <i>Scot</i> was not the word used by vast majority of Scots to describe themselves. This was in fact only the word they used to describe themselves to foreigners, amongst whom it was the most common word. The Scots called themselves <i>Albanach</i> or simply <i>Gaidel</i>. As with <i>Scot</i>, in the latter word, they used an ethnic term which connected them to the majority of the inhabitants of Ireland. As the author of <i><a href="/wiki/De_Situ_Albanie.html" title="De Situ Albanie">De Situ Albanie</a></i> tells us at the beginning of the <a href="/wiki/Thirteenth_century.html" title="Thirteenth century">thirteenth century</a>:</p>

<table border="0">

<div class="toccolours spoilercontents">

<p>Likewise, the inhabitants of English and Norse-speaking parts were ethnically linked with other regions of Europe. At <a href="/wiki/Melrose%2C_Scotland.html" title="Melrose, Scotland">Melrose</a>, people could recite religious literature in the English language.<sup id="_ref-78" class="reference"><a  title="">[82]</a></sup> In the later part of the <a href="/wiki/Twelfth_century.html" title="Twelfth century">twelfth century</a>, the Lothian writer <a  class="new" title="Adam of Dryburgh">Adam of Dryburgh</a>, tells us that Lothian was “the Land of the English in the Kingdom of the Scots”. <sup id="_ref-79" class="reference"><a  title="">[83]</a></sup></p>
<p>However, if Scotland possessed large ethnic differences, then it also possessed a unity which transcended Gaelic, French and Germanic ethnic differences. By the end of our period, the Latin, French and English word <i>Scot</i> could be used for any subject of the Scottish King. Scotland's multilingual <a href="/wiki/Scoto-Norman.html" title="Scoto-Norman">Scoto-Norman</a> monarchs and mixed Gaelic and Scoto-Norman aristocracy all became part of what many scholars call the "Community of the Realm", in which these ethnic differences were largely irrelevant.</p>
