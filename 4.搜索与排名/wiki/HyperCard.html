<p><a name="Description" id="Description"></a></p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>HyperCard is based on the concept of a "stack" of virtual "cards". Cards hold data, just as they would in a <a href="/wiki/Rolodex.html" title="Rolodex">rolodex</a>. The layout engine was similar in concept to a "form" as used in most Rapid Application Development (RAD) environments (such as the <a href="/wiki/Borland_Delphi.html" title="Borland Delphi">Borland Delphi</a> or <a href="/wiki/Visual_BASIC.html" title="Visual BASIC">Visual BASIC</a>).</p>
<p>HyperCard was not only a database system — the layout of each card could be unique, just as you can write additional non-standard information on a rolodex card. The background of a stack contained elements that appeared on all cards of that stack or on all cards based on a certain background. Backgrounds could include pictures (its original purpose, "background picture"), in addition to the objects also available for each card: picture fields, buttons, (static) text, (editable) text fields and other common <a href="/wiki/GUI.html" title="GUI">GUI</a> elements. Each card then could contain different data attached to the text or picture fields, thereby creating the database functionality.</p>
<p>For instance, an address book could be built by adding to the background a few text fields to hold the name and address. Once completed, the user adds a new card (by typing Command-N) and types into the fields. The background could be modified at any time, allowing changes to be made easily. Basic operations such as search, add and delete were built into the HyperCard environment, allowing simple databases to be set up and used by anyone able to use the <a href="/wiki/Apple_Macintosh.html" title="Apple Macintosh">Apple Macintosh</a> computer.</p>
<p>Scripting in the HyperTalk language allowed the system to be easily modified and extended. Unlike many scripting languages, HyperTalk proved to be usable by a wide range of users; allowable syntax included multiple versions of the same statement, all in more or less readable <a href="/wiki/English_language.html" title="English language">English</a>.</p>
<p>For instance, <code>put the first word of the third line of the field "hello" into the field "goodbye"</code> would do exactly what it seems to do. HyperTalk included redundancy in the hope of making programming easier; for example, numbers could be specified either numerically (1, 2), as <a href="/wiki/Cardinal_number.html" title="Cardinal number">cardinals</a> (one, two), or as <a href="/wiki/Ordinal_number.html" title="Ordinal number">ordinals</a> (first, second).</p>
<p>Referring to objects and the items on cards or backgrounds was easy. The example above shows how to access data within a field on a particular card, but one could refer to any object in the same fashion — including the stack itself. All objects could be named, as in the example above. In addition, each object (including the stack itself) had unique numeric IDs.</p>
<p>HyperCard's <code>find</code> command would navigate to cards containing text. This could be made more selective with modifications such as <code>find "Bob" in card field "hello"</code>. Similarly, it had a "sort" command that allowed evaluating entire expressions to classify sort order.</p>
<p>Adding scripts was also easy. The user simply "command-option-clicked" (or they could click the "Script" button in the item's property dialog) on any element in the stack, and an editor would pop up. The script could then be edited, saved, and used immediately. In addition, HyperCard contained the "Message Box", an interactive command-line in a floating window that could execute single lines of script. This also included the "find" command, so it doubled as a search dialog. HyperCard 2.0 added a <a href="/wiki/Debugger.html" title="Debugger">debugger</a> as well.</p>
<p>HyperTalk was sufficiently popular that one of the main uses of HyperCard was not as a database, but as a programming tool. Thousands of "stacks" were written and distributed as "stackware" in the few years when HyperCard was widely available.</p>

<p><a name="Externals" id="Externals"></a></p>
<h3>Externals</h3>
<p>The power of HyperCard could be increased significantly through the use of <b>external command</b> and <b>external function</b> modules, more commonly known as <b>XCMD</b>s and <b>XFCN</b>s. These were code libraries packaged in a <a href="/wiki/Resource_fork.html" title="Resource fork">resource fork</a> that integrated into the system and/or the HyperTalk language — an early example of the <a href="/wiki/Plugin.html" title="Plugin">plugin</a> concept. Unlike conventional plugins, these did not require separate installation before they were available for use; they could be included in a stack, where they were directly available to scripts in that stack.</p>
<p>During HyperCard's peak popularity in the late 1980s, a whole ecology of vendors offered thousands of these externals for everything from HyperTalk compilers to graphing systems, database access, internet connectivity, and animation. Many of these vendors had their businesses destroyed when HyperCard was handed to Claris.<sup title="The text in the vicinity of this tag needs citation." class="noprint">[<a  title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><i>citation&#160;needed</i></a>]</sup></p>

<p><a name="Applications" id="Applications"></a></p>
<h2>Applications</h2>
<p>HyperCard has been used for all sorts of hypertext and artistic purposes. Before the advent of <a href="/wiki/Microsoft_PowerPoint.html" title="Microsoft PowerPoint">PowerPoint</a>, HyperCard was often used as a general-purpose presentation program. Examples of HyperCard applications include simple databases, "<a href="/wiki/Choose_Your_Own_Adventure.html" title="Choose Your Own Adventure">choose your own adventure</a>"—type games, educational teaching aids, and the first (off-line) <a href="/wiki/Wiki.html" title="Wiki">wiki</a>. The wiki idea originates from Macintosh HyperCard, via <a href="/wiki/Ward_Cunningham.html" title="Ward Cunningham">Ward Cunningham</a> <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Interview:_Wikinewsie_Kim_Bruning_discusses_Wikimania">[1]</a>.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid application design facilities, HyperCard was also sometimes used for prototyping of applications, and sometimes even for version 1.0 implementations. Inside Apple, the QuickTime team was one of HyperCard's biggest customers.</p>

<p>A number of commercial software products were created in HyperCard, most notably the original version of the interactive game narrative <i><a href="/wiki/Myst.html" title="Myst">Myst</a></i>, the <a href="/wiki/Voyager_Company.html" title="Voyager Company">Voyager Company</a>'s <a href="/wiki/Expanded_Books.html" title="Expanded Books">Expanded Books</a>, and multimedia CD-ROMs of <a href="/wiki/Beethoven%27s_Ninth_Symphony_CD-ROM.html" title="Beethoven's Ninth Symphony CD-ROM">Beethoven's Ninth Symphony CD-ROM</a>, <a href="/wiki/The_Beatles.html" title="The Beatles">the Beatles</a>' <i><a href="/wiki/A_Hard_Day%27s_Night_%28film%29.html" title="A Hard Day's Night (film)">A Hard Day's Night</a></i>, and the Voyager <i><a href="/wiki/MacBeth.html" title="MacBeth">MacBeth</a></i>.</p>
<p>The prototype and demo of the popular game <i><a href="/wiki/You_Don%27t_Know_Jack.html" title="You Don't Know Jack">You Don't Know Jack</a></i> was written in HyperCard.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Activision.html" title="Activision">Activision</a>, until that time primarily a game company, saw HyperCard as an entry point into the business market. Changing their name to Mediagenic, they published several major HyperCard based applications, most notably <a href="/wiki/Danny_Goodman.html" title="Danny Goodman">Danny Goodman</a>'s Focal Point, a personal information manager, and Reports For HyperCard, a program by Nine To Five Software that allowed users to treat HyperCard as a full-fledged database system with robust information viewing and printing features.</p>
<p>The HyperCard-inspired SuperCard for a while included the "Roadster" plugin that allowed stacks to be placed inside <a href="/wiki/World_Wide_Web.html" title="World Wide Web">Web</a> pages and viewed by browsers with an appropriate browser plugin. There even was a Windows version of this plugin allowing computers other than Macintoshes to use the plugin.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: History">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="History" id="History"></a></p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>HyperCard was created by <a href="/wiki/Bill_Atkinson.html" title="Bill Atkinson">Bill Atkinson</a> and initially released in August 1987, with the understanding that Atkinson would give HyperCard to Apple only if they promised to release it for free on all Macs. Apple timed its release to coincide with the <a href="/wiki/MacWorld_Conference_%26_Expo.html" title="MacWorld Conference &amp; Expo">MacWorld Conference &amp; Expo</a> in <a href="/wiki/Boston%2C_Massachusetts.html" title="Boston, Massachusetts">Boston</a>, <a href="/wiki/Massachusetts.html" title="Massachusetts">Massachusetts</a> to guarantee maximum publicity. HyperCard was a huge hit almost instantly. Many people who thought they would never be able to program a computer started using HyperCard for all sorts of automation and prototyping tasks, a surprise even to its creator.</p>
<p>Apple itself never seemed to understand what HyperCard was. Management saw that it was being used by a huge number of people, internally and externally, and bug reports and upgrade suggestions continued to flow in demonstrating it had a wide variety of users. However it was also free, which made it difficult to justify dedicating engineering resources to improving it.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: HyperCard 2.0">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="HyperCard_2.0" id="HyperCard_2.0"></a></p>
<h3>HyperCard 2.0</h3>
<p>In late 1989, <a href="/wiki/Kevin_Calhoun.html" title="Kevin Calhoun">Kevin Calhoun</a>, then a HyperCard engineer at Apple, led an effort to upgrade the program. This resulted in 1990's <b>HyperCard 2.0</b>. The new version included an on-the-fly <a href="/wiki/Compiler.html" title="Compiler">compiler</a> that greatly increased performance of computationally intensive code, a new <a href="/wiki/Debugger.html" title="Debugger">debugger</a> and a number of improvements to the underlying HyperTalk language.</p>
<p>At the same time HyperCard 2.0 was being developed, a separate group within Apple developed and in 1991 released "HyperCard IIGS", a version of HyperCard for the <a href="/wiki/Apple_IIGS.html" title="Apple IIGS">Apple IIGS</a> system. Aimed mainly at the education market, HyperCard IIGS had roughly the same feature set as the 1.x versions of Macintosh HyperCard, while adding support for the color graphics capabilities of the IIGS. Although "stacks" (HyperCard program documents) were not binary-compatible, a translator program (itself a HyperCard stack) allowed stacks to be moved from one platform to the other.</p>
<p>Then, Apple decided that all software, including HyperCard and the <a href="/wiki/Mac_OS.html" title="Mac OS">Mac OS</a>, would be the property of a wholly-owned subsidiary called <a href="/wiki/Claris.html" title="Claris">Claris</a>. Many of the HyperCard developers chose to stay at Apple rather than move to Claris, causing the development team to be split. Claris, in the business of selling software for a profit, attempted to create a business model where HyperCard could also generate revenues. They wrote a new "viewer only" version, the <b>HyperCard Player</b> which Apple distributed with the Macintosh operating system, while Claris sold the "full" version commercially. Many users were upset that they had to pay to use software that had traditionally been supplied free and which many considered a basic part of the Mac.</p>
<p>Despite the new revenue stream, Claris did little to market HyperCard. Development continued with minor upgrades, as well as the first failed attempt to create a third generation of HyperCard. During this period, HyperCard began losing market share. Without a number of important, basic features, HyperCard authors began moving to systems such as <a href="/wiki/SuperCard.html" title="SuperCard">SuperCard</a> and <a href="/wiki/Macromedia_Authorware.html" title="Macromedia Authorware">Macromedia Authorware</a>. Nevertheless HyperCard continued to be popular and used for a widening range of applications, from the game <i><a href="/wiki/The_Manhole.html" title="The Manhole">The Manhole</a></i>, an earlier effort by the creators of <i><a href="/wiki/Myst.html" title="Myst">Myst</a></i>, to corporate information services and many thousands in between.</p>
<p>Apple eventually folded Claris back into the parent company, returning HyperCard to Apple's core engineering group. In 1992, Apple released the eagerly anticipated upgrade of HyperCard 2.2 and made many HyperCard enthusiasts happy by including licensed versions of Color Tools and Addmotion II, adding support for color pictures and animations. However, these tools were limited and often cumbersome to use; HyperCard still continued to lack true, internal color support.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: HyperCard 3.0">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="HyperCard_3.0" id="HyperCard_3.0"></a></p>
<h3>HyperCard 3.0</h3>
<p>Several attempts were made to restart HyperCard development once it returned to Apple. Because of the product's widespread use as a multimedia authoring tool it was rolled into the <a href="/wiki/QuickTime.html" title="QuickTime">QuickTime</a> group. A new effort to allow HyperCard to create <b>QuickTime interactive</b> (QTi) movies started, once again under the direction of Kevin Calhoun. QTi extended QuickTime's core multimedia playback features to provide true interactive facilities and a low-level programming language based on 68000 assembly language. The resulting <b>HyperCard 3.0</b> was first presented in 1996 when an alpha-quality version was shown to developers at Apple's annual <a href="/wiki/Worldwide_Developers_Conference.html" title="Worldwide Developers Conference">Worldwide Developers Conference</a>. Demos throughout the late 1990s showed many popular features such as color support, internet connectivity, and the ability to play HyperCard stacks (which were now special QuickTime movies) in a <a href="/wiki/Web_browser.html" title="Web browser">web browser</a>. Development of HyperCard 3.0 stalled when the QuickTime team was focused away from development of QuickTime interactive to the streaming features of QuickTime 4.0. Finally in 2000 the HyperCard engineering team was reassigned to other tasks after <a href="/wiki/Steve_Jobs.html" title="Steve Jobs">Steve Jobs</a> decided to abandon the product. Kevin Calhoun left Apple shortly after in 2001.</p>
<p>In the years that followed, the program saw no additional support from Apple and its use shrank and people grew fed up with what was now a hopelessly outdated product. Apple finally ceased selling HyperCard in March 2004.</p>

<h2>Legacy</h2>
<p>HyperCard is one of the first products that made use of and popularized the <a href="/wiki/Hypertext.html" title="Hypertext">hypertext</a> concept to a large popular base of users.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Jakob_Nielsen_%28usability_consultant%29.html" title="Jakob Nielsen (usability consultant)">Jakob Nielsen</a> has pointed out that HyperCard was really only a <a href="/wiki/Hypermedia.html" title="Hypermedia">hypermedia</a> program since its links started from regions on a card, not text objects; actual <a href="/wiki/HTML.html" title="HTML">HTML</a>-style text <a href="/wiki/Hyperlink.html" title="Hyperlink">hyperlinks</a> were possible in later versions, but were awkward to implement and seldom used.</p>
<p>HyperCard saw a loss in popularity with the growth of the World Wide Web, since the Web could handle and deliver data in much the same way as HyperCard without being limited to files on your hard disk. Interestingly, HyperCard had a significant impact on the web as it inspired the creation of both <a href="/wiki/HTTP.html" title="HTTP">HTTP</a> itself and <a href="/wiki/JavaScript.html" title="JavaScript">JavaScript</a> (through its influence on <a href="/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee.html" title="Tim Berners-Lee">Tim Berners-Lee</a>'s colleague <a href="/wiki/Robert_Cailliau.html" title="Robert Cailliau">Robert Cailliau</a>).</p>

<p>The pointing-finger <a href="/wiki/Cursor_%28computers%29.html" title="Cursor (computers)">cursor</a> used for navigating stacks later found its way into the first web browsers, as the hyperlink cursor.</p>

<li><a href="/wiki/Oracle_Corporation.html" title="Oracle Corporation">Oracle</a> purchased a cross-platform clone and released it as <b><a  class="new" title="OracleMediaObjects">OracleCard</a></b>, renamed <b><a href="/wiki/Oracle_Media_Objects.html" title="Oracle Media Objects">Oracle Media Objects</a></b>, used as a <a href="/wiki/4GL.html" title="4GL">4GL</a> for database access.</li>
<li>Most recently Runtime's <b><a href="/wiki/Revolution_%28development_environment%29.html" title="Revolution (development environment)">Revolution</a></b> incorporates all of HyperTalk (the HyperCard scripting language), and a large part of the feature set. It expands significantly on HyperCard's feature set and offers a full GUI toolkit. It runs on Macintosh, Windows, and Unix.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, many of the basic concepts of the original system were later re-used in other forms. Apple built their system-wide scripting engine <a href="/wiki/AppleScript.html" title="AppleScript">AppleScript</a> on a language very similar to HyperTalk; it was recently discovered as a perfect fit for <a href="/wiki/Desktop_publishing.html" title="Desktop publishing">DTP</a> <a href="/wiki/Workflow_automation.html" title="Workflow automation">workflow automation</a> needs. The concept of the <a href="/wiki/Wiki.html" title="Wiki">wiki</a> evolved from HyperCard<a  class="external autonumber" title="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WikiHistory">[2]</a>. AppleScript gained a graphical programming front-end called Automator in the most recent major release of <a href="/wiki/Mac_OS_X.html" title="Mac OS X">Mac OS X</a>, codenamed Tiger, released in April 2005. Some see HyperCard as an ancestor to <a href="/wiki/Visual_Basic.html" title="Visual Basic">Visual Basic</a> by <a href="/wiki/Microsoft.html" title="Microsoft">Microsoft</a>. One of HyperCard's strengths was its handling of <a href="/wiki/Multimedia.html" title="Multimedia">multimedia</a>, and many multimedia systems like <a href="/wiki/Macromedia_Authorware.html" title="Macromedia Authorware">Macromedia Authorware</a> are based on concepts originating in HyperCard.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/AppWare.html" title="AppWare">AppWare</a>, originally known as <b>Sirius Developer</b>, is sometimes seen to be similar to HyperCard, as they were both <a href="/wiki/Rapid_application_development.html" title="Rapid application development">rapid application development</a> system. AppWare was sold in the early 90s and was remarkable in that its application worked on both Windows and Mac systems.</p>
<p>On a less positive note, as HyperCard executed scripts in stacks immediately on opening it was also one of the first applications susceptible to <a href="/wiki/Macro_virus_%28computing%29.html" title="Macro virus (computing)">macro viruses</a>. The Merryxmas virus was discovered in 1993 by Ken Dunham, two years before the "Concept" virus.</p>
<p>The computer game <a href="/wiki/Myst.html" title="Myst">Myst</a> franchise, initially released as a HyperCard stack, still lives on, making HyperCard a facilitating technology for starting one of the best-selling computer game of all time.</p>
<p>According to <a href="/wiki/Ward_Cunningham.html" title="Ward Cunningham">Ward Cunningham</a>, the inventor of <a href="/wiki/Wiki.html" title="Wiki">Wikis</a>, ideas of the concept can be traced back to a HyperCard stack he wrote in the late 1980s, making HyperCard one of the grandparents of the Wiki idea.</p>

<h2>Trivia</h2>
<p>Originally called <b>WildCard</b> during its development, the name was changed to HyperCard before official release due to <a href="/wiki/Trademark.html" title="Trademark">trademark</a> issues. The HyperCard application and its associated files retain a <a href="/wiki/Creator_code.html" title="Creator code">creator code</a> of <code>WILD</code>, reflecting this period of development.</p>
<p>The last sixteen bytes of every HyperCard 2.x stack are the <a href="/wiki/Pascal_programming_language.html" title="Pascal programming language">Pascal</a> string "Nu är det slut …" (<i>Now it is over …</i> in <a href="/wiki/Swedish_language.html" title="Swedish language">Swedish</a>) though this is never seen by users. This was probably a reference to the 1970s <a href="/wiki/Sweden.html" title="Sweden">Swedish</a> children's TV show <i>Fem myror är fler än fyra elefanter</i> ("Five ants are more than four elephants") where each episode ended with a pink animated cartoon elephant saying these words.</p>
