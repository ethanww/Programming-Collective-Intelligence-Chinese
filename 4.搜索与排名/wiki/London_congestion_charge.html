<p>The <b>London congestion charge</b> is a fee for some motorists entering the Central <a href="/wiki/London.html" title="London">London</a> area. London was not the first <a href="/wiki/City.html" title="City">city</a> to adopt <a href="/wiki/Road_charging.html" title="Road charging">road charging</a>, but <a href="/wiki/As_of_2006.html" title="As of 2006">as of 2006</a> it is the largest city to do so. The organisation responsible for administering the charge is <a href="/wiki/Transport_for_London.html" title="Transport for London">Transport for London</a> (TfL).</p>
<p>The stated aim of the scheme is to encourage travellers to use <a href="/wiki/Public_transport.html" title="Public transport">public transport</a>, cleaner vehicles, <a href="/wiki/Bicycle.html" title="Bicycle">bicycles</a>, <a href="/wiki/Motorcycle.html" title="Motorcycle">motorcycles</a> or their own two feet instead of motor <a href="/wiki/Automobile.html" title="Automobile">cars</a> and <a href="/wiki/Van.html" title="Van">vans</a>, thus reducing <a href="/wiki/Traffic_congestion.html" title="Traffic congestion">congestion</a> and allowing for faster, less polluting and more predictable journeys<sup title="The text in the vicinity of this tag needs citation." class="noprint">[<a  title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><i>citation&#160;needed</i></a>]</sup>. The fee was introduced on <a href="/wiki/February_17.html" title="February 17">17 February</a> <a href="/wiki/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a>.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a  title="">[1]</a></sup> Initially set at £5, but raised on <a href="/wiki/July_4.html" title="July 4">4 July</a> <a href="/wiki/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a> to £8 <sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a  title="">[2]</a></sup>, the daily charge must be paid by the registered owner of a vehicle that enters, leaves or moves around within the congestion charge zone between 7am and 6.30pm, Monday to Friday. From <a href="/wiki/June_19.html" title="June 19">19 June</a> <a href="/wiki/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a><sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a  title="">[3]</a></sup> a new 'Pay-Next-Day' scheme was introduced allowing drivers to pay their congestion charge until midnight on the day of travel, or pay £10 until midnight on the following charging day. Failure to pay by midnight means a fine of at least £50.</p>
<p>In September 2005, the western expansion of the congestion charge was confirmed, and it will come into effect in February 2007. There are also plans by the <a href="/wiki/Mayor_of_London.html" title="Mayor of London">Mayor of London</a> to increase the charge to now £10 despite stating that the charge would not be raised for at least ten years <sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a  title="">[4]</a></sup>, and that from 2008 there may be discounts for vehicles with low rates of <a href="/wiki/CO2.html" title="CO2">CO2</a> emission, followed by a £25 rate for vehicles producing an emission of more than 226 g/km of CO2<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a  title="">[5]</a></sup>.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>The present boundary of the zone is sometimes referred to as the <a href="/wiki/London_Inner_Ring_Road.html" title="London Inner Ring Road">London Inner Ring Road</a>. Starting at the northernmost point and moving clockwise, the major <a href="/wiki/Road.html" title="Road">roads</a> defining the boundary are <a href="/wiki/Pentonville_Road.html" title="Pentonville Road">Pentonville Road</a>, <a href="/wiki/City_Road_%28London%29.html" title="City Road (London)">City Road</a>, <a href="/wiki/Old_Street.html" title="Old Street">Old Street</a>, <a href="/wiki/Commercial_Street_%28London%29.html" title="Commercial Street (London)">Commercial Street</a>, <a href="/wiki/Mansell_Street_%28London%29.html" title="Mansell Street (London)">Mansell Street</a>, <a href="/wiki/Tower_Bridge_Road.html" title="Tower Bridge Road">Tower Bridge Road</a>, <a href="/wiki/New_Kent_Road.html" title="New Kent Road">New Kent Road</a>, <a href="/wiki/Elephant_and_Castle.html" title="Elephant and Castle">Elephant and Castle</a>, <a href="/wiki/Vauxhall_Bridge_Road.html" title="Vauxhall Bridge Road">Vauxhall Bridge Road</a>, <a href="/wiki/Park_Lane.html" title="Park Lane">Park Lane</a>, <a href="/wiki/Edgware_Road.html" title="Edgware Road">Edgware Road</a>, <a href="/wiki/Marylebone_Road.html" title="Marylebone Road">Marylebone Road</a> and <a href="/wiki/Euston_Road.html" title="Euston Road">Euston Road</a> (other roads fill the small gaps between these roads). The zone therefore includes the whole of the <a href="/wiki/City_of_London.html" title="City of London">City of London</a>, the city's financial district, and the <a href="/wiki/West_End_of_London.html" title="West End of London">West End</a>, the city's primary commercial and entertainment centre.

Closed-circuit cameras and vans police the zone, capturing live video. Vans can be identified by a sticker on the back door (inset).</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>230 <a href="/wiki/Closed-circuit_television.html" title="Closed-circuit television">CCTV</a>-style cameras, of which 180 are installed at the edge of the zone, <a href="/wiki/Video.html" title="Video">video</a> roads in the zone. There are also a number of mobile camera units which may be deployed anywhere in the zone. It is estimated that around 98% of vehicles moving within the zone are caught on camera. The video streams are transmitted to a data centre in central London where a computer system equipped with <a href="/wiki/Automatic_number_plate_recognition.html" title="Automatic number plate recognition">Automatic number plate recognition</a> software detects the registration plate of the vehicle. A second data centre provides a backup location for image data.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a  title="">[6]</a></sup> <sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a  title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>Although this is not infallible, it needs to have only a reasonable probability of success to work. Both front and back number plates are captured on cars going both in and out of the zone. This gives four chances of capturing the number plates of a car.</p>
<p>In addition to the 180 cameras on the edge of the zone, there are 50 further cameras placed within it. These cameras are intended to pick up cars that are missed on entry and exit and those that are solely moving within the zone. The level of accuracy of ANPR technology, and subsequent problems resulting from sending fines to the wrong vehicle if the number plate is misread by the computer, mean that pictures of offending vehicles are checked visually by Capita staff. This is why it takes 48 hours for fines to be issued and contributes to the cost (circa £98m per annum) of running the scheme.</p>
<p>This list is then compared with a list of cars whose owners/operators have paid to enter the zone. Those that have paid but not been seen in the central zone are not refunded, but those that have <i>not</i> paid and <i>are</i> seen are fined. The registered owner of such a vehicle is looked up in a database provided by the <a href="/wiki/Driver_and_Vehicle_Licensing_Agency.html" title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency">Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency</a> (DVLA), based in <a href="/wiki/Swansea.html" title="Swansea">Swansea</a>. The fine is £100, reduced to £50 if paid within 14 days, but increased to £150 if unpaid after 28 days.</p>
<p>Whilst private drivers are obliged to pay the charge on the day they enter the zone (or earlier) whether they are seen to enter the zone or not, the same does not apply to fleets of business vehicles. A business can register a group of cars with TfL, and is charged £5 per visit for all vehicles in the fleet detected by the cameras. In May 2005, one enterprising businessman, Miguel Camacho, set up a business, fivepounds.co.uk, whose sole function was to sign up private drivers to their "fleet", thus offering the convenience of not having to pay the charge pro-actively, avoiding fines in the case of a forgotten journey and also potentially getting a "free journey" if undetected by the cameras. Transport for London, 36% of whose charge revenue comes from fines, moved quickly to quash the loophole, by demanding that fleet operators provide V5 logbooks for each vehicle in their fleet. The extra requirement will add to genuine fleets' workload. Fivepounds went out of business on 26 February 2006.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a  title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>ANPR technology is not used for congestion charging anywhere else in the world <sup title="The text in the vicinity of this tag needs citation." class="noprint">[<a  title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><i>citation&#160;needed</i></a>]</sup>. Stockholm's congestion charge system, introduced for a sixth-month trial in January 2006, uses a <a  class="new" title="Tag and Beacon">Tag and Beacon</a> system. Used on many European motorways, it consists of a charge card mounted on the windscreen which is 'read' by roadside beacons. Credit is deducted from the card as the car passes the beacon. Stockholm has a variable charging system, which peaks at the rush hours and remains at its lowest between 9.00am and 3.00pm.</p>
<p>TfL started to move towards the Tag and Beacon system barely 18 months after the charge went live. Contracts for new generation ANPR cameras were signed in the summer of 2004 and testing of the roadside beacons started in 2005. Officially TfL would not commit itself (as of mid-2006) to switching to Tag and Beacon. With Tag and Beacon, drivers don't have to remember to pay - the charge is deducted automatically, leading to a reduction in administrative costs, but also a reduction in fines.</p>
<p>Some vehicles such as <a href="/wiki/Bus.html" title="Bus">buses</a>, minibuses (over a certain size), <a href="/wiki/Taxicab.html" title="Taxicab">taxis</a>, <a href="/wiki/Emergency_service.html" title="Emergency service">emergency service</a> vehicles (i.e. ambulances, fire engines and police vehicles), <a href="/wiki/Motorcycle.html" title="Motorcycle">motorcycles</a>, <a href="/wiki/Alternative_fuel.html" title="Alternative fuel">alternative fuel</a> vehicles and <a href="/wiki/Bicycle.html" title="Bicycle">bicycles</a> are exempt from the charge. Technically, some of the exemptions are 100% discounts and still require registration. In the case of <a href="/wiki/Hybrid_vehicle.html" title="Hybrid vehicle">Hybrid vehicles</a>, the registration fee exceeds the congestion charge for occasional visitors and requires considerable supporting documentation which is not included when the car is purchased. Residents of the zone are eligible for a 90% discount if they pay the charge for a week or more at once.</p>
<p>In 2005 it was revealed that several London <a href="/wiki/Embassy.html" title="Embassy">embassies</a> were not paying the charge as they believed it to be a <i>tax</i>, which they are protected from paying under the <a href="/wiki/Vienna_Convention_on_Diplomatic_Relations.html" title="Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations">Vienna Convention</a><sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a  title="">[9]</a></sup>. Although some embassies have agreed to pay the charge <sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a  title="">[10]</a></sup>, the US embassy currently (<a href="/wiki/May_14.html" title="May 14">14 May</a> <a href="/wiki/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>) owes £270,000 (approximately $500,000) in fines for non-payment, they do however, pay <i>tolls</i> in Oslo and Singapore<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a  title="">[11]</a></sup>.</p>

<h2>Why the congestion charge is notable</h2>
<p>The congestion plan has attracted a lot of attention for several reasons. It was the first large-scale congestion charge scheme to be introduced in the UK (a much smaller £2 scheme had been running in <a href="/wiki/Durham.html" title="Durham">Durham</a> since 2002). If successful in reducing traffic congestion, other busy cities around the world are likely to follow suit. The plan relies on advanced technology. Drivers may pay the charge on the <a href="/wiki/World_Wide_Web.html" title="World Wide Web">Web</a>, by <a href="/wiki/Short_message_service.html" title="Short message service">SMS</a> text message, in shops equipped with a <a href="/wiki/PayPoint.html" title="PayPoint">PayPoint</a>, or by phone. The initial cost of setting up the scheme was £200m, with an annual operating cost of about £115m<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a  title="">[12]</a></sup> , and is expected to pay for itself within three years.</p>
<p>The whole idea has been heavily criticised by some opponents. They argue that the <a href="/wiki/Public_transport.html" title="Public transport">public transport</a> network has insufficient spare capacity to cater for travellers deterred from using their cars in the area by the charge. Further, it is said the scheme will hit poorer sections of society more than the rich, as the charge to enter the zone is a flat £8 for all, regardless of vehicle size. To balance this, however, it has been pointed out that there is no free non-residents' parking available within the zone during the charging period .</p>
<p>TfL contracted <a href="/wiki/Capita_Group.html" title="Capita Group">Capita Group</a> to implement the scheme. Subcontractors include <a  class="external text" title="http://www.mastek.com">Mastek Ltd</a>, based in <a href="/wiki/Mumbai.html" title="Mumbai">Mumbai</a>, <a href="/wiki/India.html" title="India">India</a>, who are responsible for much of the <a href="/wiki/Information_Technology.html" title="Information Technology">IT</a> infrastructure. They claim that it is the largest project to date implemented using <a href="/wiki/Microsoft.html" title="Microsoft">Microsoft</a>'s <a href="/wiki/Microsoft_.NET.html" title="Microsoft .NET">.NET</a> platform. Due to the wide spread around the globe of sub-contractors and because some data protection regulations vary from country to country, the scheme has prompted concerns about privacy from technology specialists.<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a  title="">[13]</a></sup></p>

<p>Before the charge's introduction, there were fears of a very chaotic few days as the charge bedded down. Indeed <a href="/wiki/Ken_Livingstone.html" title="Ken Livingstone">Ken Livingstone</a>, <a href="/wiki/Mayor_of_London.html" title="Mayor of London">Mayor of London</a> and key proponent of the charge, himself predicted a "bloody day". In fact, the first two days saw a dramatic reduction in inner city traffic. On the first day 190,000 vehicles moved into or within the zone during charging hours, a decrease of around 25% on normal traffic levels. Excluding 45,000 exempt vehicles, the decrease was more than 30%. <a href="/wiki/Anecdotal_evidence.html" title="Anecdotal evidence">Anecdotal evidence</a> suggests journey times were decreased by as much as half. Just over 100,000 motorists paid the charge personally, 15–20,000 were fleet vehicles paying under fleet arrangements, and it is believed around 10,000 liable motorists did not pay the due charge. An extra 300 buses (out of a total of around 20,000) were introduced on the same day. Bus and <a href="/wiki/London_Underground.html" title="London Underground">London Underground</a> managers reported that buses and tubes were little, if at all, busier than normal.</p>
<p>Initially it was believed that the reduction in traffic was caused by the half-term school holidays, but this has proved not to be the case. Reports consistently indicate that, over the first month or so of operation, traffic was down at least 15% on pre-charge levels (the first week had a decrease of 20%). Journey times have correspondingly crept back towards pre-charge levels, following initial reported time-savings of as much as 50%. Although very precise statistics are less readily available than just after the charge's introduction, chiefly because media attention is now directed elsewhere, the general feeling was that the charge was having the intended effect.</p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/October_23.html" title="October 23">23 October</a> <a href="/wiki/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a> TfL published a report surveying the first six months of the charge.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a  title="">[14]</a></sup> The main findings of the report were that on average the number of cars entering the central zone was 60,000 fewer than the previous year, representing a drop in non-exempt vehicles of 30%. Around 50–60% of this reduction was attributed to transfers to public transport, 20–30% to journeys avoiding the zone, and the remainder to car-sharing, reduced number of journeys, more travelling outside the hours of operation, and increased use of motorbikes and cycles. Journey times were found to have been reduced by 15%. Variation in journey time for a particular route repeated on many occasions also decreased.</p>
<p>The report said that the charge was responsible for only a small fraction of the drop in retail sales. In August 2003, the <a href="/wiki/John_Lewis_Partnership.html" title="John Lewis Partnership">John Lewis Partnership</a> had announced that in the first six months of the charge's operation, sales at their <a href="/wiki/Oxford_Street.html" title="Oxford Street">Oxford Street</a> store fell by 8% whilst sales at other stores in the Greater London area but outside the congestion charge zone, such as in <a href="/wiki/Kingston_upon_Thames.html" title="Kingston upon Thames">Kingston</a>, rose. TfL said that only around 0.5% of the drop was attributable to the charge. The organisation said that London is suffering from a long-term failure to modernise its transport and other infrastructure, and that the charge will in the long term be a benefit.</p>
<p>The report also stated that around 100,000 penalty fines are issued in each month. Around 2,000 are appealed against. The larger than anticipated reduction in traffic numbers meant that TfL revenue would be only be £68&#160;m — well below the £200&#160;m per year expected by TfL's first projections in 2001. In practice, once the extensive roadworks undertaken in London during 2001-2002 were lifted in November of that year, TfL found traffic levels had dropped noticeably, and the profit projection was lowered to £130&#160;m per year. Once the charge came live in February 2003, traffic levels dipped again, hence the much lower revenue than expected. The report says that the charge appears to have no impact, either positive or negative, on road safety — the slow trend towards fewer accidents has continued.</p>
<p>A further report published by TfL in October 2004 stated that only seven of the 13 government aims for London transport would be met by 2010. The target on reducing congestion will not be met, the report said, suggesting a failure of the congestion charge policy.<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a  title="">[15]</a></sup> However, that report refers to London as a whole; the failure to reduce congestion overall is mostly attributable to the sprawling suburbs, where it is much more difficult to provide a comprehensive public transport network and the car has a much higher share of journeys.</p>

<h2>Criticisms of the charge</h2>
<p>Several shops and businesses have been heavily impacted by the cost of the charge, both in terms of lost sales and increased delivery costs as recognised by the London Chamber of Commerce. There have also been news stories suggesting the levels of congestion will soon return to pre-congestion charge levels and many people have argued that instead of increasing costs to motorists, public transport should be priced more competitively.</p>
<p>The Congestion Charge has proved controversial in Outer London, where it has encouraged commuters who previously drove into central London to instead park at suburban railway or underground stations. This has led to the widespread imposition of controlled parking zones in these areas, at the expense of local residents. Some studies suggest that congestion-charging simply leads to the export of congestion (and jobs) from inner cities to suburbs <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.racfoundation.org/files/parking%20final%20report.pdf">[1]</a>.</p>

<h2>History of the charge</h2>
<p>Many <a href="/wiki/Toll_road.html" title="Toll road">toll roads</a> and bridges have existed in <a href="/wiki/England.html" title="England">England</a>, both now and in the past. Tolls became common in England in the late 1600s, following the decline of roads after the <a href="/wiki/Protestant_Reformation.html" title="Protestant Reformation">Protestant Reformation</a> (Catholic monks no longer maintained the roads). By the end of the 1700s, the inter-city road network in England was primarily a toll road network of <a href="/wiki/Turnpikes.html" title="Turnpikes">turnpikes</a>. Toll roads eventually died out in the late 1800s, due to competition from <a href="/wiki/Railway.html" title="Railway">railways</a>, gross inefficiency, and complaints from users making longer trips (thus needing to pay more tolls). General road tolls have also been advocated by many others in the past, such as the 18th century economist <a href="/wiki/Adam_Smith.html" title="Adam Smith">Adam Smith</a>.</p>
<p>Schemes similar to the current congestion charge have been under consideration by the <a href="/wiki/British_Government.html" title="British Government">British Government</a> since the early 1960s. The <a  class="new" title="Smeed Report">Smeed Report</a> of 1964 first assessed the practicality of road pricing in a British city. During the early years of the <a href="/wiki/Greater_London_Council.html" title="Greater London Council">Greater London Council</a> the first plans were drawn up for a system of cordon charging or supplementary licensing for use in the central area. A formal study was undertaken into the merits of the scheme, and in 1973 concluded that it would improve traffic and environmental conditions in the centre. However the newly elected <a href="/wiki/Labour_Party_%28UK%29.html" title="Labour Party (UK)">Labour</a> council rejected the study's findings in favour of greater investment in <a href="/wiki/Public_transport.html" title="Public transport">public transport</a>, and road charging was taken off the agenda.</p>
<p>The idea nevertheless persisted and gained renewed support in the mid-1990s. The London Congestion Research Programme concluded in July 1995 that the city's economy would benefit from such a scheme.<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a  title="">[16]</a></sup> The power to introduce a form of congestion charge was given to any future mayor in the <a href="/wiki/Greater_London_Authority.html" title="Greater London Authority">Greater London Authority</a> Act of 1999. Having won the first mayoral election in 2000, Livingstone opted to exercise these powers as promised in his independent manifesto, and carried out a series of consultations with interested parties. The basic scheme was agreed in February 2002, and charging commenced, with some concessions accepted, on <a href="/wiki/February_17.html" title="February 17">17 February</a> <a href="/wiki/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a>.</p>
<p>The congestion charge was suspended on <a href="/wiki/July_7.html" title="July 7">7 July</a> and <a href="/wiki/July_8.html" title="July 8">8 July</a> <a href="/wiki/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>, in response to the <a href="/wiki/7_July_2005_London_bombings.html" title="7 July 2005 London bombings">terrorist attacks on London Transport</a>.</p>

<h2>Future plans</h2>
<p>In the aftermath of the introduction of the charge, there were a number of suggestions for its future. Soon after charging commenced, Livingstone announced that he would carry out a formal review of the charge's success or failure six months after its introduction — brought forward from one year, following the smooth start. On <a href="/wiki/February_25.html" title="February 25">25 February</a> <a href="/wiki/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a> Livingstone stated "I can't conceive of any circumstances in the foreseeable future where we would want to change the charge, although perhaps ten years down the line it may be necessary" referring to the amount that drivers have to pay, indicating that £5 was sufficient to bring about the reduction in traffic that he had hoped for.#<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a  title="">[17]</a></sup>. By November 2004, Livingstone directly contradicted his earlier stance and said in an interview with BBC London "I have always said that during this term [his second term in office] it will go up to at least £6."<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a  title="">[18]</a></sup> By the end of the month, Livingstone had changed tack again, saying in an announcement that in fact the rise would be to £8 for private vehicles and £7 for commercial traffic. Business groups such as <a  class="new" title="London First">London First</a> were furious at the announcement, saying they were "totally unsatisfactory and unacceptable".<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a  title="">[19]</a></sup> <sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a  title="">[20]</a></sup> The rise to £8 was announced formally on <a href="/wiki/April_1.html" title="April 1">1 April</a> <a href="/wiki/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>, along with discounts for drivers buying month or year-long tickets.<sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a  title="">[21]</a></sup> <sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a  title="">[22]</a></sup>. On 10th May 2006, on a live TV debate, Livingstone supported a rise in the charge to £10 by 2008.</p>
<p>Soon after the introduction of the charge, newspapers began to speculate that the extension of the congestion charging zone would form part of Livingstone's manifesto for re-election as mayor (under the <a href="/wiki/Labour_Party_%28UK%29.html" title="Labour Party (UK)">Labour Party</a> banner) in 2004. Sure enough, in February 2004, TfL issued a consultation document<sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a  title="">[23]</a></sup> on the expansion of the zone to the west, including a map of the enlarged zone<sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a  title="">[24]</a></sup> that would cover the rest (western portion) of Westminster and the <a href="/wiki/Royal_Borough_of_Kensington_and_Chelsea.html" title="Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea">Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea</a>.</p>
<p>Following Livingstone's re-election in the <a href="/wiki/London_mayoral_election%2C_2004.html" title="London mayoral election, 2004">June 2004 mayoral race</a>, in August 2004 the results of the consultation were published. A substantial majority of respondents did not want the extension, but Livingstone said that the consultation "was not representative" and that the extension would go ahead anyway. Critics of Livingstone said that this was proof that the consultation had been a "useless rubber-stamping exercise" that Livingstone had to go through merely to avoid possible legal challenges to the scheme in the future.</p>
<p>In May 2005 TfL announced a further consultation period with specific proposals about the extensions. These included a plan to reduce the operating hours of the charge by half-an-hour to "boost trade at London's theatres, restaurants and cinemas".<sup id="_ref-24" class="reference"><a  title="">[25]</a></sup> <sup id="_ref-25" class="reference"><a  title="">[26]</a></sup> At the end of September 2005, London Mayor Ken Livingstone confirmed the western expansion of the congestion charge, to come into effect on 19th February 2007.<sup id="_ref-26" class="reference"><a  title="">[27]</a></sup> <sup id="_ref-27" class="reference"><a  title="">[28]</a></sup></p>
<p>The new zone will be double the size, covering areas such as Kensington, Chelsea and the western part of Westminster. The Mayor admitted that this will increase traffic within the existing zone, due to the 230,000 residents that will find themselves living in the zone, and therefore with a discounted charge. Opposition is overwhelming to the expansion, with a significant majority of those responding to two public consultations, opposing the ban<sup title="The text in the vicinity of this tag needs citation." class="noprint">[<a  title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><i>citation&#160;needed</i></a>]</sup>. This included businesses which say they are already struggling with sales: the heart of London shopping at <a href="/wiki/Oxford_Street.html" title="Oxford Street">Oxford Street</a> is already within the original zone.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Steven_Norris.html" title="Steven Norris">Steven Norris</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Conservative_Party_%28UK%29.html" title="Conservative Party (UK)">Conservative Party</a> candidate for mayor in 2004, has been a fierce critic of the charge, branding it the 'Kengestion' charge, and pledged to scrap it if he became mayor in June 2004. He had also pledged that, if elected, he would grant an amnesty to anyone with an outstanding fine for non-payment of the charge on <a href="/wiki/June_11.html" title="June 11">11 June</a> <a href="/wiki/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>.

Amongst some of the changes he proposed included changing the end time from 6.30pm to 5pm; automatically giving all vehicles 5 free days a year so as not to affect occasional visitors. It is extremely unlikely these proposed changes will happen, following Livingstone's second mayoral victory.</p>

<p>Further afield, some other cities around the world already using congestion charging zones include <a href="/wiki/Oslo.html" title="Oslo">Oslo</a>, <a href="/wiki/Bergen%2C_Norway.html" title="Bergen, Norway">Bergen</a>, <a href="/wiki/Trondheim.html" title="Trondheim">Trondheim</a> and <a href="/wiki/Singapore.html" title="Singapore">Singapore</a> — <a href="/wiki/Electronic_Road_Pricing.html" title="Electronic Road Pricing">the first city to do so</a>, in 1998.<sup id="_ref-29" class="reference"><a  title="">[30]</a></sup> The success of the scheme in reducing the number of cars on the road caused some, such as the <a href="/wiki/Institute_for_Public_Policy_Research.html" title="Institute for Public Policy Research">Institute for Public Policy Research</a>, a left-wing <a href="/wiki/Think_tank.html" title="Think tank">think tank</a>, to call for similar schemes to be rolled out across the country.<sup id="_ref-30" class="reference"><a  title="">[31]</a></sup> However, in November <a href="/wiki/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a>, <a href="/wiki/Secretary_of_State_for_Transport.html" title="Secretary of State for Transport">Secretary of State for Transport</a> <a href="/wiki/Alistair_Darling.html" title="Alistair Darling">Alistair Darling</a> said that despite apparent initial sparks of interest from many city councils, including those of <a href="/wiki/Leeds.html" title="Leeds">Leeds</a>, <a href="/wiki/Cardiff.html" title="Cardiff">Cardiff</a>, <a href="/wiki/Manchester.html" title="Manchester">Manchester</a>, <a href="/wiki/Birmingham.html" title="Birmingham">Birmingham</a> and <a href="/wiki/Bristol.html" title="Bristol">Bristol</a>, no city apart from <a href="/wiki/Edinburgh.html" title="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a> had yet approached the Government for assistance in introducing a charge. The situation is likely to change once the bids for "pump-priming" funding from the <a  class="new" title="Transport Innovation Fund">Transport Innovation Fund</a> (England only) are announced in November 2005. It seems unlikely that Edinburgh will introduce a scheme anytime soon, after a <a href="/wiki/Edinburgh_Road_Tolls_Referendum%2C_2005.html" title="Edinburgh Road Tolls Referendum, 2005">postal referendum</a> showed that almost 75% of voters in Edinburgh opposed congestion charging.<sup id="_ref-31" class="reference"><a  title="">[32]</a></sup> Unlike in London, where Ken Livingstone had sufficient <a href="/wiki/Devolved_government.html" title="Devolved government">devolved</a> powers to introduce the charge on his own authority, other cities would require the confirmation of the Secretary of State for Transport under the Transport Act 2000.</p>
<p>Cities in other countries have also been monitoring the scheme. For example, city councillors in <a href="/wiki/Queens.html" title="Queens">Queens</a> and <a href="/wiki/Brooklyn.html" title="Brooklyn">Brooklyn</a> cited a report from the London <a href="/wiki/Chamber_of_Commerce.html" title="Chamber of Commerce">Chamber of Commerce</a> that claimed the charge hurt business to pre-emptively dissuade <a href="/wiki/New_York_City.html" title="New York City">New York City</a> mayor <a href="/wiki/Michael_Bloomberg.html" title="Michael Bloomberg">Michael Bloomberg</a> from introducing a similar scheme.<sup id="_ref-32" class="reference"><a  title="">[33]</a></sup></p>
