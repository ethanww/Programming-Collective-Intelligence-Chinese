<p><a name="Early_years" id="Early_years"></a></p>
<h2>Early years</h2>
<p>Unlike most prominent politicians in Taiwan, Chen came from an impoverished background. Chen was born to a <a href="/wiki/Tenant_farmer.html" title="Tenant farmer">tenant farming</a> family in Kuantien Township of <a href="/wiki/Tainan_County.html" title="Tainan County">Tainan County</a> on the second day of the ninth lunar month in <a href="/wiki/1950.html" title="1950">1950</a> but was not formally issued a birth certificate until <a href="/wiki/February_18.html" title="February 18">February 18</a>, <a href="/wiki/1951.html" title="1951">1951</a> because of doubts that he would survive.</p>
<p>In June <a href="/wiki/1969.html" title="1969">1969</a>, he was admitted to the <a href="/wiki/National_Taiwan_University.html" title="National Taiwan University">National Taiwan University</a>. Initially a Business Administration major, he switched to Law in his first year and became editor of the school's law review. He passed the bar exams before the completion of his junior year with the highest score, earning him the distinction of being Taiwan's youngest lawyer. He graduated in 1974 with a <a href="/wiki/LL.B..html" title="LL.B.">LL.B.</a> in Commercial Law.</p>
<p>In 1975, he married <a href="/wiki/Wu_Shu-chen.html" title="Wu Shu-chen">Wu Shu-chen</a>, the daughter of a <a href="/wiki/Physician.html" title="Physician">physician</a>. The couple have a daughter, <a href="/wiki/Chen_Hsing-yu.html" title="Chen Hsing-yu">Chen Hsing-yu</a> (<a  class="extiw" title="zh:陳幸妤">陳幸妤</a>), who is a <a href="/wiki/Dentist.html" title="Dentist">dentist</a> and son, <a  class="new" title="Chen Chih-Chung">Chen Chih-Chung</a> (<a  class="extiw" title="zh:陳致中">陳致中</a>), who, after having been received a law degree in Taiwan, studied at and graduated with a <a href="/wiki/Master_of_Laws.html" title="Master of Laws">Master of Laws</a> degree from the <a href="/wiki/University_of_California%2C_Berkeley.html" title="University of California, Berkeley">University of California, Berkeley</a> in 2005.<sup title="The text in the vicinity of this tag needs citation." class="noprint">[<a  title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><i>citation&#160;needed</i></a>]</sup></p>
<p>From 1976 to 1989, Chen was a partner in Formosa International Marine and Commercial Law, where he specialized in maritime insurance and held the firm's portfolio for <a href="/wiki/Evergreen_Marine_Corporation.html" title="Evergreen Marine Corporation">Evergreen Marine Corporation</a>.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Entrance into politics">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Entrance_into_politics" id="Entrance_into_politics"></a></p>
<h2>Entrance into politics</h2>
<p>Chen became involved in politics in 1980 when he defended the participants of the <a href="/wiki/Kaohsiung_Incident.html" title="Kaohsiung Incident">Kaohsiung Incident</a> against a military court. While his client <a  class="new" title="Huang Hsin-chieh">Huang Hsin-chieh</a> (<a  class="extiw" title="zh:黃信介">黃信介</a>), the leading opposition dissident, and seven co-defendants, including his future Vice President <a href="/wiki/Annette_Lu.html" title="Annette Lu">Annette Lu</a>, were all found guilty, Chen came to be known for his forceful and colorful arguments. He has stated that it was during this period that he realized the unfairness of the political system in Taiwan and became politically active as a member of the <a href="/wiki/Tangwai.html" title="Tangwai">Tangwai</a> movement.</p>
<p>Chen won a seat in the Taipei City Council as a Tangwai candidate in 1981 and served until 1985. In 1984, he founded the pro-opposition <a  class="new" title="Civil Servant Public Policy Research Association">Civil Servant Public Policy Research Association</a>, which published a magazine called <i><a  class="new" title="Neo-Formosa">Neo-Formosa</a></i>.</p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/January_12.html" title="January 12">January 12</a>, <a href="/wiki/1985.html" title="1985">1985</a>, Chen was sentenced to a year in prison for <a href="/wiki/Libel.html" title="Libel">libel</a>, when, as editor of a <i>Neo-Formosa</i> magazine, he published an article critical of <a href="/wiki/Elmer_Feng.html" title="Elmer Feng">Elmer Feng</a>, then a college philosophy professor who was later elected a <a href="/wiki/Kuomintang.html" title="Kuomintang">Kuomintang</a> (KMT) legislator. As he was appealing the sentence, he returned to Tainan to run for county magistrate in November 1985. Three days after losing the election, his wife, Wu Shu-chen was hit by a truck, twice, as they were thanking their supporters, which left her paralyzed from the waist down. His supporters believed this was part of a government campaign to intimidate him. Chen writes in his autobiography that he feels guilty to his late father-in-law for this incident because of his failure to keep up to the promised that his actions in politics will not harm his family and ignoring repeated death threats from his opponents.</p>
<p>Chen lost his appeal in May 1986 and began serving his eight months in the <a  class="new" title="Tucheng Penitentiary">Tucheng Penitentiary</a> (土城看守所) along with <a  class="new" title="Huang Tien-fu">Huang Tien-fu</a> (黃天福) and <a  class="new" title="Lee Yi-yang">Lee Yi-yang</a> (李逸洋), two other defendants in the same case. While he was in prison, his wife campaigned and was elected to the <a href="/wiki/Legislative_Yuan.html" title="Legislative Yuan">Legislative Yuan</a>. Chen also reflects how the various visits his wife made to him in prison overwhelmed him as she often fell off from the wheelchair with no one to assist her. Upon his release, Chen served as her legislative assistant and practiced law.</p>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/1989.html" title="1989">1989</a>, Chen was elected to the <a href="/wiki/Legislative_Yuan.html" title="Legislative Yuan">Legislative Yuan</a> and served as the executive director of the Democratic Progressive Party Congress. With the support of some KMT colleagues, Chen was also elected convener of the National Defense Committee. He was instrumental in laying out and moderating many of the DPP's positions on <a href="/wiki/Taiwanese_independence.html" title="Taiwanese independence">Taiwanese independence</a>, including the <a href="/wiki/Four_ifs.html" title="Four ifs">four ifs</a>. He was reelected to another three year term in 1992, but resigned in two years to become mayor.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Mayor of Taipei">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Mayor_of_Taipei" id="Mayor_of_Taipei"></a></p>
<h2>Mayor of Taipei</h2>
<p>Chen was elected as the mayor of <a href="/wiki/Taipei.html" title="Taipei">Taipei</a> in <a href="/wiki/1994.html" title="1994">1994</a>, largely as the result of a vote split between the highly unpopular KMT incumbent <a href="/wiki/Huang_Ta-chou.html" title="Huang Ta-chou">Huang Ta-chou</a> (黃大洲) and the KMT-spin-off <a href="/wiki/New_Party_%28Taiwan%29.html" title="New Party (Taiwan)">New Party</a> (NP) candidate <a  class="new" title="Chao Shaokong">Chao Shaokong</a> (<a  class="extiw" title="zh:趙少康">趙少康</a>). Unable to find experienced bureaucrats from his own party, Chen and his inner circle of young law school graduates retained many of the KMT administrators and delegated considerable authority.</p>
<p>During his term, Chen received accolades for his campaigns to drive illegal gambling and prostitution rackets out of Taipei. He levied large fines on polluters and reformed public works contracts. He closed brothels and demolished the slums to create a new park. Chen renamed many of the roads in Taipei, most notably the road which runs between KMT Headquarters to the Presidential Palace from "Chieh-shou Road" (介壽路 jiè shòu lù) (Longevity for Chiang Kai-shek Road) to "<a href="/wiki/Ketagalan_Boulevard.html" title="Ketagalan Boulevard">Ketagalan Boulevard</a>" (凱達格蘭大道) in an effort to acknowledge the <a href="/wiki/Taiwanese_aboriginal.html" title="Taiwanese aboriginal">aboriginal people</a> of the Taipei basin. Chen also made highly publicized evictions of longtime KMT squatters on municipal land, and ordered <a href="/wiki/Chiang_Wei-kuo.html" title="Chiang Wei-kuo">Chiang Wei-kuo</a>'s estate demolished. Chen was also named as one of the top rising stars from Asia, and Taipei became one of the top 50 cities in Asia by Time Magazine's Asia version.</p>
<p>Despite receiving more votes both in absolute and in percentage terms than his 1994 campaign, Chen lost this position in <a href="/wiki/1998.html" title="1998">1998</a> to the KMT's rising star <a href="/wiki/Ma_Ying-jeou.html" title="Ma Ying-jeou">Ma Ying-jeou</a> in large part because the KMT was able to get the support of New Party supporters. In his first autobiography, "The Son of Taiwan", Chen wrote that he was not entirely upset about losing the reelection as it gave him opportunity to find out what areas in his political career he could improve. For example, he wrote that how Mainlanders generally approved of his social and economic improvements in Taipei, but they ultimately voted for Ma because of ethnic tensions. He also traveled extensively nationwide and abroad. In South Korea, he met with President Kim Dae Jung, who presented him with an award.</p>
<p>He also met with Japanese Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori, who promised that he would celebrate if he won the 2000 presidential elections. Due to obvious complications, this promise was not fulfilled until late 2003.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: First term presidency">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="First_term_presidency" id="First_term_presidency"></a></p>
<h2>First term presidency</h2>
<p>In an election eerily similar to Taipei's in 1994, Chen won the <a href="/wiki/ROC_presidential_election%2C_2000.html" title="ROC presidential election, 2000">2000 presidential election</a> on <a href="/wiki/March_18.html" title="March 18">March 18</a> with only 39% of the vote as a result of a split of factions within the <a href="/wiki/Kuomintang.html" title="Kuomintang">Kuomintang</a>, when <a href="/wiki/James_Soong.html" title="James Soong">James Soong</a> ran for the presidency as an independent against the party nominee <a href="/wiki/Lien_Chan.html" title="Lien Chan">Lien Chan</a>.</p>
<p>Lacking a clear mandate and inheriting a bureaucracy largely loyal to the KMT, Chen tried to reach out to his opposition. He appointed the KMT conservative mainlander <a href="/wiki/Tang_Fei.html" title="Tang Fei">Tang Fei</a>, a former general and the incumbent defense minister, as his first <a href="/wiki/Premier_of_the_Republic_of_China.html" title="Premier of the Republic of China">Premier</a>. Only half of Chen's original cabinet were DPP members, as few DPP politicians had risen above the local level. Although a supporter of <a href="/wiki/Taiwan_independence.html" title="Taiwan independence">Taiwan independence</a>, Chen moderated his stance during his campaign and pledged the <a href="/wiki/Four_Noes_and_One_Without.html" title="Four Noes and One Without">Four Noes and One Without</a> in his inaugural address—that as long as the <a href="/wiki/People%27s_Republic_of_China.html" title="People's Republic of China">People's Republic of China</a> has no intention to use military force against Taiwan, he would not declare independence nor change the national symbols of the Republic of China. He also promised to be "president of all the people" and resigned his chairmanship from the DPP. His approval rating reached 70%.</p>
<p>Chen's administration ran into many problems, and its policies were constantly being blocked by the <a href="/wiki/Pan-Blue_Coalition.html" title="Pan-Blue Coalition">Pan-Blue Coalition</a>-controlled legislature. The stock market lost over half its value within a year and unemployment reached 4.5%. While Chen's detractors blamed Chen's poor leadership for the economic crisis, the administration blamed the legislature for blocking its relief efforts.</p>
<p>More troublesome for Chen was the political showdown over the construction of the <a  class="new" title="Number Four Nuclear Power Facility">Number Four Nuclear Power Facility</a> (<a  class="extiw" title="zh:第四核能發電廠">第四核能發電廠</a>). This multibillion dollar project in <a  class="new" title="Kungliao">Kungliao</a> (<a  class="extiw" title="zh:貢寮">貢寮</a>) was already one-third completed and favored by the pro-business KMT as a means of avoiding an energy shortage. However, the environmentalist DPP strongly objected to the expansion of nuclear power. Premier Tang had threatened to resign if the project were cancelled, and Chen accepted his resignation on <a href="/wiki/October_3.html" title="October 3">October 3</a>, <a href="/wiki/2000.html" title="2000">2000</a>, only four and a half months after both had taken office. Chen appointed his political ally <a href="/wiki/Chang_Chun-hsiung.html" title="Chang Chun-hsiung">Chang Chun-hsiung</a> as Tang's replacement. On <a href="/wiki/October_27.html" title="October 27">October 27</a>, Chang announced that the government would halt construction. But less than an hour before, President Chen had met with Lien Chan to reconcile differences. Lien had asked Chen to leave the matter for the <a href="/wiki/Legislative_Yuan.html" title="Legislative Yuan">Legislative Yuan</a> to decide and Chen seemed receptive to the suggestion. When Chang's announcement came out, Lien was furious and the KMT began an effort to recall the President. The <a href="/wiki/Council_of_Grand_Justices.html" title="Council of Grand Justices">Council of Grand Justices</a> intervened and declared that it was the legislature and not the cabinet that had the power to decide on the issue. This was widely seen as the end of Chen's attempts to face the pan-blue groups head on. By the end of his first year in office, Chen's approval ratings had dropped to 25%.</p>
<p>During summer of 2001, Chen flew to Los Angeles, Houston, and New York City, where he met with members of the U.S. Congress. The mayor of Houston presented Chen with a key to the city and gave him cowboy clothing. His trip to the Big Apple was a first for a head of state from Taiwan as there was unwritten agreement between the US and China that no head of state from Taiwan would be permitted to visit either New York or Washington, D.C.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>After his first year in office, Chen seemed to move away from sending conciliatory gestures. In the summer of 2002, Chen became the chairman of the DPP. During his tenure, images of <a href="/wiki/Chiang_Kai-shek.html" title="Chiang Kai-shek">Chiang Kai-shek</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Chiang_Ching-kuo.html" title="Chiang Ching-kuo">Chiang Ching-kuo</a> (and to a lesser degree <a href="/wiki/Sun_Yat-sen.html" title="Sun Yat-sen">Sun Yat-sen</a>) have disappeared from public buildings. The word "TAIWAN" is now printed on new ROC passports. Also continuing a trend from the previous administration, the Education Ministry has revised the school curriculum to be more Taiwan-centered. Government websites have also tended to promote the notion that China is synonymous with the PRC.

<h2>Position on Taiwan's status</h2>
<p>Chen's and the <a href="/wiki/Democratic_Progressive_Party.html" title="Democratic Progressive Party">Democratic Progressive Party</a> position on <a href="/wiki/Political_status_of_Taiwan.html" title="Political status of Taiwan">Taiwan's political status</a> is that Taiwan is already an independent, sovereign nation named the <a href="/wiki/Republic_of_China.html" title="Republic of China">Republic of China</a>. This has the implication that a <a href="/wiki/Declaration_of_independence.html" title="Declaration of independence">declaration of independence</a> is unnecessary as Taiwan is already independent. This view point, however, is subjected to change in each election campaign. At the same time, it also has the implication that the pledge by Chen to preserve the status quo or not change Taiwan's sovereign status would not preclude a declaration of independence but would preclude acceptance of the <a href="/wiki/One_China_policy.html" title="One China policy">one China policy</a>.</p>
<p>It is generally accepted that Chen's position on this issue is intended and to a large degree has succeeded in placating his pro-independence supporters without crossing any red lines that would trigger war. His supporters see these positions as creative and indicative of a willingness to compromise. However, it is also common among his opponents in Taiwan, as well as among policy makers in <a href="/wiki/Mainland_China.html" title="Mainland China">mainland China</a> and the pro-PRC United States politicians to see his statements in their own much darker terms. Many among his critics believe that his positions and actions reveal Chen to be an old style Taiwanese politician and promote that his seemingly conciliatory statements are merely a smokescreen to advance a hidden agenda of advancing de-facto <a href="/wiki/Taiwan_independence.html" title="Taiwan independence">Taiwan independence</a>. These suspicions appear to arise from the actions of his KMT predecessor <a href="/wiki/Lee_Teng-hui.html" title="Lee Teng-hui">Lee Teng-hui</a> who now readily admits to secretly trying to advance de-facto Taiwan independence during his presidential terms.</p>
<p>President Chen admits that he leans towards independence but his main position is opposition to adopting the One China principle since it prevents Taiwanese people from being able to decide upon their own future. From this it is speculated that if a large majority of Taiwanese did vote for unification in a referendum without the PRC putting any diplomatic or military pressure on Taiwan during the referendum, Chen would abide by the result.</p>
<p>In an interview in July <a href="/wiki/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>, Chen explicitly repudiated the position of all former Taiwanese leaders that the Republic of China was still the legitimate government of the whole of China. "The republic of China on Taiwan and the People's Republic of China on the mainland are two separate countries with divided rule and do not exercise sovereignty over each other," he said. "Under the principle of popular sovereignty and self determination, we consider that the question of whether Taiwan should be united with China should be the decision of the 23 million people of Taiwan." <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/common/story_page/0,5744,16258960%255E28737,00.html">[1]</a></p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/February_28.html" title="February 28">February 28</a>, <a href="/wiki/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>, Chen announced the <a href="/wiki/National_Unification_Council.html" title="National Unification Council">National Unification Council</a>, set up in 1990, and its guidelines, which had committed Taiwan to unification if China adopts democracy, would "cease to function". He took care to use the phrase "ceased to exist" rather than abolish when he made the announcement because he had promised in 2000 that he would not abolish the council or its guidelines. Newspapers on both sides of the Taiwan strait criticized Chen severely for scrapping the unification council.</p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/March_2.html" title="March 2">March 2</a>, <a href="/wiki/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> in a stern announcement, Adam Ereli, Deputy Spokesman of the US state department, said that the US expected the Taiwan authorities to publicly correct the record that there is no distinction between "abolish" and "ceasing activity" and unambiguously affirm that the February 27 announcement did not abolish the <a href="/wiki/National_Unification_Council.html" title="National Unification Council">National Unification Council</a> and did not change the status quo and that the assurances remain in effect. <a  class="external text" title="http://www.ait.org.tw/en/news/officialtext/viewer.asp?ID=2006030302&amp;GROUP=BG">American Institute in Taiwan - Official Texts</a></p>

<p><a name="Re-election_campaign_and_referendum" id="Re-election_campaign_and_referendum"></a></p>
<h2>Re-election campaign and referendum</h2>
<p>In late <a href="/wiki/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a>, he signed a controversial referendum bill, which he had supported but was heavily watered down by the <a href="/wiki/Pan-Blue_Coalition.html" title="Pan-Blue Coalition">Pan-Blue</a> majority legislature. One concession that the legislature made was to include a provision for an emergency defensive referendum and during the legislative debates it was widely believed that this clause would only be invoked if Taiwan was under imminent threat of attack from China as has been so often threatened. Within a day of the passage of the referendum bill, Chen stated his intention to invoke this provision, citing PRC's over 450 missiles aimed directly at the Taiwanese. <a href="/wiki/Pan-Blue_Coalition.html" title="Pan-Blue Coalition">Pan-Blue</a> believed that his bill was only intended to benefit Chen in the coming election, as whether PRC removes the missiles cannot be decided by ROC's referendum result.</p>
<p>In October 2003, Chen flew to New York City for the second time. At the <a href="/wiki/Waldorf-Astoria_Hotel.html" title="Waldorf-Astoria Hotel">Waldorf-Astoria Hotel</a>, he was presented with the Human Rights Award by the <a  class="new" title="International League of Human Rights">International League of Human Rights</a>. In the subsequent leg of the trip to Panama, he met with US Secretary of State <a href="/wiki/Colin_Powell.html" title="Colin Powell">Colin Powell</a> and shook hands with him. This high profile trip raised Chen's opinion polls ahead of his opponent Lien Chan for the first time at 35%, according to Agence France Presse.</p>
<p>His use of the referendum in combination with his talk of a new constitution lead many among his reunification critics to believe that he would attempt to achieve <a href="/wiki/Taiwan_independence.html" title="Taiwan independence">Taiwan independence</a> in his second term by invoking a referendum to create a new constitution that would formally separate Taiwan from any interpretation of <a href="/wiki/China.html" title="China">China</a>. This caused the Bush led government of the United States to follow the lead of Chen's political critics and issue a rare rebuke of Chen's actions.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/3-19_shooting_incident.html" title="3-19 shooting incident">Chen was shot in the stomach</a> while campaigning in the city of <a href="/wiki/Tainan_City.html" title="Tainan City">Tainan</a> on Friday, <a href="/wiki/March_19.html" title="March 19">March 19</a>, <a href="/wiki/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>, the day before polls opened on Saturday. According to Chen, the bullet left a flesh wound that was 8 cm long and 2 cm deep and was found in his clothes. He left the hospital on the same day with 14 stitches. His Vice President <a href="/wiki/Annette_Lu.html" title="Annette Lu">Annette Lu</a> was shot in the leg in the same incident. Many believe that <a href="/wiki/March_19%2C_2004_assassination_attempt_in_Taiwan.html" title="March 19, 2004 assassination attempt in Taiwan">the shooting</a> was a set-up to help Chen win the election by earning sympathy votes, but their views are not supported by any evidence. Since the incident, a large quantity of rumors, conspiracy theories, claims and counter-claims have been generated and propagated both on the <a href="/wiki/Internet.html" title="Internet">Internet</a> and in the Taiwanese media.</p>
<p>The following day, Chen narrowly won the election with a margin of less than 30,000 votes out of 12.9 million votes counted. Both of his referendum proposals were rejected due to insufficient turnout. The Pan-Blue candidate <a href="/wiki/Lien_Chan.html" title="Lien Chan">Lien Chan</a> refused to concede and sued both for a recount and for a nullification of the outcome while supporters held a week-long violent protest in front of the <a href="/wiki/Presidential_Building_%28Taiwan%29.html" title="Presidential Building (Taiwan)">presidential office</a> in Taipei due to alleged election irregularities throughout the island. He also claimed that the shooting was staged by Chen to win sympathy votes. Chen claimed that the shooting could not have been staged because it would be too dangerous to have himself shot in a moving jeep and also challenged Lien and Vice Presidential Candidate <a href="/wiki/James_Soong.html" title="James Soong">James Soong</a> to try their luck with a shooter in a stationary jeep. However, most theories on how the shooting could have been staged do not center on Chen's injury having occurred while he was in the moving jeep. Most theories go along the lines that his wound was made beforehand and/or afterwards. Of course, this does not explain the sudden appearance of bullet holes in the window of the jeep.</p>
<p>Throughout the election, Chen planned to hold a referendum in <a href="/wiki/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> on a new <a href="/wiki/Constitution_of_the_Republic_of_China.html" title="Constitution of the Republic of China">constitution</a> to be enacted upon the accession of the 12th-term president in May <a href="/wiki/2008.html" title="2008">2008</a>. After the election, he sought to reassure critics and moderate supporters that the new constitution would not address the issue of sovereignty, and that the current constitution was in need of comprehensive reform after more than a decade of patchwork revision.</p>
<p>There have been two interpretations of Chen's actions during the election in terms of independence politics. The first is that he is ideologically committed to advancing <a href="/wiki/Taiwan_independence.html" title="Taiwan independence">Taiwan independence</a> and that his actions are intended to systematically remove the constraints which prevent this from occurring. Seen in this light, his actions are intended to provoke a crisis in which the PRC must either start a war or accept independence, with the expectation that the PRC would back down. Ironically, this interpretation of his actions is shared both among his most fervent supporters (who think it is a good thing) and his most bitter opponents (who think that it is a bad thing). It is largely to counter this possibility that the PRC has issued statements that it will definitely go to war if certain red lines are crossed. However, they in reality carry little meaning, as Beijing has made such statements warning against electing former President <a href="/wiki/Lee_Teng-hui.html" title="Lee Teng-hui">Lee</a> and Chen in the 1996 and 2000 elections, which both failed to materialize. Some people regard these statements now as reverse psychology, as Lee and Chen may help to weaken ROC and advance the unification process.</p>
<p>The second interpretation is that Chen's actions are primarily intended to placate his core supporters rather than provoke a crisis. People who subscribe to this interpretation point out that Chen's early efforts to moderate his pro-independence position did not create a positive reaction either from Mainland China or from his anti-independence opponents on Taiwan. He also alienated some pro-independence supporters. Therefore Chen was forced to take a more assertive approach both as a negotiation tactic with the PRC and to keep support from his core supporters. This strategy is consistent with the oft-stated position that Taiwan would only seek independence as a <i>preemptive</i> measure in the face of evidence of PRC military aggression. However, even this interpretation provokes unease among many people, especially among policy makers in <a href="/wiki/People%27s_Republic_of_China.html" title="People's Republic of China">Mainland China</a> and the <a href="/wiki/United_States.html" title="United States">United States</a>. The first problem is that this interpretation makes Chen seem like an old-style Taiwan politician that seems to say whatever pleases people. The second, more serious problem is the fear that through misunderstanding and misinterpretation, Chen may provoke a war without intending to do so, as <a href="/wiki/People%27s_Republic_of_China.html" title="People's Republic of China">Mainland China</a> has repeatedly claimed that any progress towards independence would provoke war.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Second term presidency">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Second_term_presidency" id="Second_term_presidency"></a></p>
<h2>Second term presidency</h2>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/May_20.html" title="May 20">May 20</a>, <a href="/wiki/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>, Chen was sworn in for his second term as President amid continued mass protests by the pan-blue alliance over the validity of his re-election. Having heard protests from pro-independence figures in Taiwan, he did not explicitly re-state the <a href="/wiki/Four_Noes_and_One_Without.html" title="Four Noes and One Without">Four Noes and One Without</a> but did state that he reaffirmed the commitments made in his first inaugural. He defended his proposals to change the constitution, but asked for constitutional reform to be undertaken through existing procedures instead of calling for a referendum for an entirely new constitution which was proposed by former president Lee Teng-hui. This would require approval by a three-fourths majority of the <a href="/wiki/National_Assembly_of_the_Republic_of_China.html" title="National Assembly of the Republic of China">National Assembly</a> which could authorize a referendum. This has two major implications. First, by going through existing constitutional amendment procedures, this has the symbolic effect of maintaining continuity with the existing constitution which was originally written in <a href="/wiki/Mainland_China.html" title="Mainland China">Mainland China</a>. Second, this has the practical effect of requiring the Chen administration to get the consent of the opposition <a href="/wiki/Pan-Blue_coalition.html" title="Pan-Blue coalition">Pan-Blue coalition</a> to pass any amendments, and while the opposition is willing to consider constitutional reforms that would increase governmental efficiency, they are unlikely to support anything that would imply a <i>de jure</i> declaration of independence.</p>
<p>However, even these seemingly conciliatory gestures did not quell unease by his critics at his election. Some have pointed out that he qualified his statements on the constitution with the statement that this is a personal suggestion. Furthermore, it is widely believed in Taiwan that some of these gestures were essentially forced on him again by pressure from the United States and Mainland China. The People's Republic of China has stated many times that it cares little about what Chen says, but will watch closely in the next few months to see what he does, a standard sentence that Communist China continues to quote.</p>
<p>Three days before Chen's inauguration, the Taiwan Affairs Office of the <a href="/wiki/People%27s_Republic_of_China.html" title="People's Republic of China">People's Republic of China</a> issued what has become known as the <a href="/wiki/May_17_Declaration.html" title="May 17 Declaration">May 17 Declaration</a>. In that declaration, China accused Chen of continuing with a creep toward independence, having merely paid lip service to his commitments in his first term of office, and reiterated that there would be consequences if Chen did not halt policies toward <a href="/wiki/Taiwan_independence.html" title="Taiwan independence">Taiwan independence</a>, but at the same time offered major concessions if Chen would accept the <a href="/wiki/One_China_principle.html" title="One China principle">one China principle</a>.</p>
<p>In late 2004, in effort to maintain the <a href="/wiki/Balance_of_power.html" title="Balance of power">balance of power</a> in the region, Chen began eagerly pushing for an US$18 billion arms purchase from the United States, but the Pan-Blue Coalition has blocked the deal from passing the legislature, arguing the money should be spent on other measures. It is widely believed that the U.S will protect Taiwan from China. Chen announced on <a href="/wiki/December_5.html" title="December 5">December 5</a> that state-owned enterprises and foreign offices bearing the name "China", such as <a href="/wiki/China_Airlines.html" title="China Airlines">China Airlines</a>, the <a  class="new" title="China Steel Corporation">China Steel Corporation</a> (中國鋼鐵股份有限公司), and <a  class="new" title="Chinese Petroleum Corporation">Chinese Petroleum Corporation</a> (<a  class="extiw" title="zh:中國石油股份有限公司">中國石油股份有限公司</a>), would be renamed to bear the name "Taiwan". On <a href="/wiki/December_14.html" title="December 14">December 14</a>, <a href="/wiki/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>, following the failure of the <a href="/wiki/Pan-Green_coalition.html" title="Pan-Green coalition">Pan-Green coalition</a> to gain a majority of seats in the <a href="/wiki/ROC_legislative_election%2C_2004.html" title="ROC legislative election, 2004">ROC legislative election, 2004</a> (as many had expected to occur), Chen resigned as chairman of the DPP. This dashed hopes that the stalemate that plagued Chen's first term would end.</p>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a> Chen became the first ROC president to visit <a href="/wiki/Europe.html" title="Europe">Europe</a>, when he attended the funeral of <a href="/wiki/Pope_John_Paul_II.html" title="Pope John Paul II">Pope John Paul II</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Vatican_City.html" title="Vatican City">Vatican City</a> (the <a href="/wiki/Holy_See.html" title="Holy See">Holy See</a> continues to maintain diplomatic relations with the ROC). In order to shore up diplomatic support, it is common for the ROC president to visit the ROC's remaining diplomatic allies; however past presidents had been prevented from visiting the Vatican because such a visit would require passage through Italy, which maintains relations with the PRC. Under agreement with the Vatican, Italy permitted all guests to the funeral passage without hindrance and Chen was received at Rome's airport in his capacity as a foreign head of state. In this religious ceremony where US President <a href="/wiki/George_W._Bush.html" title="George W. Bush">George W. Bush</a> greeted Iranian President Khatami, Chen did not seem to attempt making a high profile of himself by reaching out to other heads of states such as Bush or British Prime Minister <a href="/wiki/Tony_Blair.html" title="Tony Blair">Tony Blair</a>.</p>
<p>Later in the year, Chen traveled to Miami in stopover for a forum in the Caribbean. He met with members of the <a href="/wiki/U.S._Congress.html" title="U.S. Congress">U.S. Congress</a> through video conference and was invited to visit Washington, D.C. On his way back, he was originally scheduled to fly through San Francisco. However, he changed course and stopped-over at the United Arab Emirates. The head of state greeted him and hosted a formal state dinner, infuriating the Chinese officials. Chen made his way back after making a stopover at <a href="/wiki/Jakarta.html" title="Jakarta">Jakarta</a>. His request for a pitstop at Singapore was denied, authorities cited weather problems.</p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/May_3.html" title="May 3">May 3</a>, <a href="/wiki/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>, Chen cancelled plans to pass through the United States on his way to Latin America. He was hoping to stop by either San Francisco or New York City to refuel and stay overnight, but the US refused his request instead limiting him to a brief refuelling stopover in Anchorage, Alaska where Chen would not be allowed to step off the plane. Chen and Taiwan saw this as a snub and led to Chen's cancellation. The trip to Latin America will continue, however, without a US stopover. The State Department of the United States claimed that the Alaska stopover offer was consistent with its previous accommodations. However, former Taiwan president Lee Teng-hui was granted a visit to <a href="/wiki/Cornell_University.html" title="Cornell University">Cornell University</a> eleven years ago. More recently, in addition, Taiwan's leaders have in general been granted permission to stopover in the United States for brief periods before continuing on to other countries. This recent American stance is interpreted by Taiwan to be an expression of increasing irritation the United States feels towards Taiwan and Chen's seemingly pro-independence gestures. Chen attended the inaguration of <a href="/wiki/%C3%93scar_Arias.html" title="Óscar Arias">Óscar Arias</a>, the president of <a href="/wiki/Costa_Rica.html" title="Costa Rica">Costa Rica</a>, one of the few countries that recognize the Republic of China. <a href="/wiki/Laura_Bush.html" title="Laura Bush">Laura Bush</a> was also present to represent U.S. president <a href="/wiki/George_W._Bush.html" title="George W. Bush">George W. Bush</a>. Chen seized the opportunity, approached her and shook her hands, while Chen's aide produced a camera immediately for an impromptu <a href="/wiki/Photo-op.html" title="Photo-op">photo-op</a>. Chen's supporters see this act as a step forward in Taiwan's struggle for diplomatic recognition, while his detractors claim that it was a grave breach of international <a href="/wiki/Etiquette.html" title="Etiquette">etiquette</a> and put Taiwan to shame.</p>

<p>In May <a href="/wiki/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>, his approval rating, as determined by the TSU, fell to a dismal 5.8%, after a series of scandals were discovered. Although other sources show his approval rating at around 20%, it is still very dismal. <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.chinapost.com.tw/taiwan/detail.asp?GRP=B&amp;id=82481">[2]</a> His son-in-law and son-in-law's family were alleged to be involved in <a href="/wiki/Insider_trading.html" title="Insider trading">insider trading</a>. His wife was accused of accepting huge amounts of gift certificates from a department store in exchange for government assistance in restructuring the store's business leadership. His aides were also alleged to be involved in major corrupt acts.</p>
<p>His support from his own party has also dropped with a few members calling for his sacking as he had a bad influence on his party and may cause them to lose the 2008 election.</p>
<p>On May 24, 2006, his son in law, <a href="/wiki/Chao_Chien-ming.html" title="Chao Chien-ming">Chao Chien-ming</a>, was taken into custody by the Taipei police on charges of insider stock trading and embezzlement. This is yet another setback for the Chen Shui-bian administration. In related news, there are also accusations that Chen Shui-bian's wife was involved in trading stocks and obtaining <a href="/wiki/Sogo.html" title="Sogo">Pacific Sogo Department's</a> gift certificates illegally in exchange for settling the disputed ownership.</p>
<p>On June 1, 2006, Chen declared that he was handing control of governmental matters to <a href="/wiki/Premier_of_the_Republic_of_China.html" title="Premier of the Republic of China">Premier</a> <a href="/wiki/Su_Tseng-chang.html" title="Su Tseng-chang">Su Tseng-chang</a> and announced he would not be involved in campaigning.
