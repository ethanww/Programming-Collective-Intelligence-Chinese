<p>The <b>Year 2000 problem</b> (also known as the <b>Y2K problem</b>, the <b>millennium bug</b> and the <b>Y2K Bug</b>) was the result of a practice in <a href="/wiki/Computer.html" title="Computer">computer</a> program design that caused some date-related processing to operate incorrectly for dates and times on and after <a href="/wiki/January_1.html" title="January 1">January 1</a>, <a href="/wiki/2000.html" title="2000">2000</a>. It turned into a major fear that critical industries (such as <a href="/wiki/Electricity.html" title="Electricity">electricity</a> or <a href="/wiki/Finances.html" title="Finances">financial</a>) and <a href="/wiki/Government.html" title="Government">government</a> functions would stop working at exactly midnight, January 1, 2000, and at other critical dates which were billed as "<a href="/wiki/Event_horizon.html" title="Event horizon">event horizons</a>". This fear was fueled by the press coverage and other media speculation, as well as corporate and government reports. All over the world companies and organizations checked and upgraded their computer systems. The preparation for Y2K had a significant effect on the computer industry. However, no significant level of computer failure took place when the clocks rolled over into 2000.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>
<p><b>Y2K</b> was the common abbreviation for the year 2000 problem. The abbreviation combines the letter <i>Y</i> for "year", and <i>k</i> for the Greek suffix <a href="/wiki/Kilo.html" title="Kilo">kilo</a> meaning 1000; hence, <i>2k</i> means 2000. It also went by <i>millennium bug</i> because it was associated with a roll-over of the <a href="/wiki/Millennium.html" title="Millennium">millennium</a>.</p>
<p>The term was coined on <a href="/wiki/June_12.html" title="June 12">June 12</a>, <a href="/wiki/1995.html" title="1995">1995</a> in an e-mail sent by David Eddy, a Massachusetts programmer <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://americanradioworks.publicradio.org/features/y2k/a2.html">[1]</a>. He later said, "People were calling it <a  class="new" title="Century Date Change">CDC</a> (Century Date Change) and <a  class="new" title="FADL">FADL</a> (Faulty Date Logic). There were other contenders. It just came off my <a href="/wiki/COBOL.html" title="COBOL">COBOL</a> calloused fingertips."</p>
<p>It was speculated that computer programs could stop working or produce erroneous results because they stored years with only two digits and that the year 2000 would be represented by <i>00</i> and would be interpreted by software as the year <a href="/wiki/1900.html" title="1900">1900</a>. This would cause date comparisons to produce incorrect results. It was also thought that <a href="/wiki/Embedded_systems.html" title="Embedded systems">embedded systems</a>, making use of similar date logic, might fail and cause utilities and other crucial infrastructure to fail.</p>
<p>Special committees were set up by governments to monitor remedial work and <a href="/wiki/Contingency.html" title="Contingency">contingency</a> planning, particularly by crucial infrastructures such as telecommunications, utilities and the like, to ensure that the most critical services had fixed their own problems and were prepared for problems with others. It was only the safe passing of the main "event horizon" itself, <a href="/wiki/January_1.html" title="January 1">January 1</a>, <a href="/wiki/2000.html" title="2000">2000</a>, that fully quelled public fears.</p>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/North_America.html" title="North America">North America</a> the actions taken to remedy the possible problems did have unexpected benefits. Many businesses installed computer backup systems for critical files. The <a href="/wiki/September_11%2C_2001_attacks.html" title="September 11, 2001 attacks">September&#160;11 attacks</a> destroyed hundreds of offices in the <a href="/wiki/World_Trade_Center.html" title="World Trade Center">World Trade Center</a>, potentially crippling segments of the economy; however, most of the offices had purchased backup servers in <a href="/wiki/New_Jersey.html" title="New Jersey">New Jersey</a> and elsewhere, limiting the economic impact of the attacks. The Y2K preparations further had impact on <a href="/wiki/August_14.html" title="August 14">August 14</a>, <a href="/wiki/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a> during the <a href="/wiki/2003_North_America_blackout.html" title="2003 North America blackout">2003 North America blackout</a>. The previous activities had included the installation of new electrical generation equipment and systems which allowed for a relatively rapid restoration of power in some areas.</p>

<p><a name="The_programming_problem" id="The_programming_problem"></a></p>
<h2>The programming problem</h2>
<p>The underlying programming problem was real, but more subtle than many realize. The practice of using two-digit dates for convenience long predates computers, notably in artwork. Abbreviated dates do not pose a problem for humans, as works and events pertaining to one century are sufficiently different from those of other centuries. Computers, however, are unable to make such distinctions.</p>
<p>In the <a href="/wiki/1960s.html" title="1960s">1960s</a>, <a href="/wiki/Computer_memory.html" title="Computer memory">computer memory</a> and storage were scarce and expensive, and most data processing was done on <a href="/wiki/Punch_cards.html" title="Punch cards">punch cards</a> which represented text data in 80-column records. Programming languages of the time, such as <a href="/wiki/COBOL_programming_language.html" title="COBOL programming language">COBOL</a> and <a href="/wiki/RPG_programming_language.html" title="RPG programming language">RPG</a>, processed numbers in their <a href="/wiki/ASCII.html" title="ASCII">ASCII</a> or <a href="/wiki/EBCDIC.html" title="EBCDIC">EBCDIC</a> representations. They occasionally used an extra bit called a "zone punch" to save one character for a minus sign on a negative number, or compressed two digits into one byte in a form called <a href="/wiki/Binary-coded_decimal.html" title="Binary-coded decimal">binary-coded decimal</a>, but otherwise processed numbers as straight text. Over time the punch cards were converted to magnetic tape and then disk files and later to simple databases like <a href="/wiki/ISAM.html" title="ISAM">ISAM</a>, but the structure of the programs usually changed very little. Popular software like <a href="/wiki/DBase.html" title="DBase">dBase</a> continued the practice of storing dates as text well into the <a href="/wiki/1980s.html" title="1980s">1980s</a> and <a href="/wiki/1990s.html" title="1990s">1990s</a>.</p>
<p>Saving two characters for every date field was significant in the <a href="/wiki/1960s.html" title="1960s">1960s</a>. Since programs at that time were mostly short-lived affairs programmed to solve a specific problem, or control a specific hardware-setup, neither managers nor programmers of that time expected their programs to remain in use for many decades. The realization that databases were a new type of program with different characteristics had not yet come, and hence most did not consider fixing two digits of the year a significant problem. There were exceptions, of course; the first person known to publicly address the problem was <a href="/wiki/Bob_Bemer.html" title="Bob Bemer">Bob Bemer</a> who had noticed it in <a href="/wiki/1958.html" title="1958">1958</a>, as a result of work on <a href="/wiki/Genealogical.html" title="Genealogical">genealogical</a> software. He spent the next twenty years trying to make programmers, IBM, the US government and the ISO aware of the problem, with little result. This included the recommendation that the COBOL PICTURE clause should be used to specify four digit years for dates. This could have been done by programmers at any time from the initial release of the first COBOL compiler in <a href="/wiki/1961.html" title="1961">1961</a> onwards. However, lack of foresight, the desire to save storage space, and overall complacency prevented this advice from being followed. Despite magazine articles on the subject from <a href="/wiki/1970.html" title="1970">1970</a> onwards, the majority of programmers only started recognizing Y2K as a looming problem in the mid-1990s, but even then, inertia and complacency caused it to be mostly ignored until the last few years of the decade.</p>
<p>Storage of a combined date and time within a fixed binary field is often considered a solution, but the possibility for software to misinterpret dates remains, because such date and time representations must be relative to a defined origin. Roll-over of such systems is still a problem but can happen at varying dates and can fail in various ways. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>The typical <a href="/wiki/Unix_time.html" title="Unix time">Unix timestamp</a> stores a date and time as a 32-bit signed integer number representing, roughly speaking, the number of seconds since <a href="/wiki/January_1.html" title="January 1">January 1</a>, <a href="/wiki/1970.html" title="1970">1970</a>, and will roll over in <a href="/wiki/2038.html" title="2038">2038</a> and cause the <a href="/wiki/Year_2038_problem.html" title="Year 2038 problem">year 2038 problem</a>.</li>
<li>The popular <a href="/wiki/Spreadsheet.html" title="Spreadsheet">spreadsheet</a> <a href="/wiki/Microsoft_Excel.html" title="Microsoft Excel">Microsoft Excel</a> stores a date as a number of days since an origin (often erroneously called a <a href="/wiki/Julian_day.html" title="Julian day">Julian</a> date). A Julian date stored in a 16-bit integer will overflow after 65,536 days (approximately 179 years). Unfortunately, the Windows versions of the program by default start at <a href="/wiki/1900.html" title="1900">1900</a> and the Mac versions by default starts at <a href="/wiki/1904.html" title="1904">1904</a> (although this can usually be changed).</li>
<li>The <a href="/wiki/Microsoft_Excel.html" title="Microsoft Excel">Microsoft Excel</a> spreadsheet program also had a very elementary Y2K problem: Excel (in both Windows versions and Mac version, when they are set to start at 1900) incorrectly regarded the year 1900 as a <a href="/wiki/Leap_year.html" title="Leap year">leap year</a>. In addition, the years 2100, 2200 and so on were regarded as leap years. This bug was fixed in later versions, but since the <a href="/wiki/Epoch_%28reference_date%29.html" title="Epoch (reference date)">epoch</a> of the Excel timestamp was set as <a href="/wiki/January_1.html" title="January 1">January 1</a>, <a href="/wiki/1900.html" title="1900">1900</a> in previous versions, the year 1900 is still regarded as a leap year to maintain <a href="/wiki/Backward_compatibility.html" title="Backward compatibility">backward compatibility</a>.</li>
<li>In the <a href="/wiki/C_programming_language.html" title="C programming language">C programming language</a>, the standard library function to get the current year originally did have the problem that it returned only the year number within the 20th century, and for compatibility's sake still returns the year as year minus 1900. Many programmers in C, and in <a href="/wiki/Perl_programming_language.html" title="Perl programming language">Perl</a> and <a href="/wiki/JavaScript.html" title="JavaScript">JavaScript</a>, two programming languages widely used in Web development that use the C functions, incorrectly treated this value as the last two digits of the year. On the Web this was a mostly harmless bug, but it did cause many dynamically generated webpages to display <a href="/wiki/January_1.html" title="January 1">January 1</a>, <a href="/wiki/2000.html" title="2000">2000</a>, as "1/1/19100", "1/1/100", or variations of that depending on the format.</li>
<li>Older applications written for the commonly used <a href="/wiki/UNIX.html" title="UNIX">UNIX</a> source code control system <a href="/wiki/SCCS.html" title="SCCS">SCCS</a> failed to handle years that began with the digit "2".</li>
</ul>
<p>Even before <a href="/wiki/January_1.html" title="January 1">January 1</a>, <a href="/wiki/2000.html" title="2000">2000</a> arrived, there were also some worries about <a href="/wiki/September_9.html" title="September 9">September 9</a>, <a href="/wiki/1999.html" title="1999">1999</a> (albeit lesser compared to those generated by Y2K). This date could also be written in the numeric format, 9/9/99. This date value was frequently used to specify an unknown date; it was thus possible that programs might act on the records containing unknown dates on that day. <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.merlyn.demon.co.uk/critdate.htm">[2]</a> It is also somewhat similar to the end-of-file code, 9999, in old programming languages. It was feared that some programs might unexpectedly terminate on that date. The bug however was more likely to confuse computer operators rather than machines.</p>
<p>Another related problem for the year 2000 was that it was a <a href="/wiki/Leap_year.html" title="Leap year">leap year</a> even though years ending in "00" are normally not leap years. (A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4 but not divisible by 100 unless also divisible by 400.) Fortunately most programs were fixed in time.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Public reaction to the problem">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Public_reaction_to_the_problem" id="Public_reaction_to_the_problem"></a></p>
<h2>Public reaction to the problem</h2>
<p>As the decade progressed, identifying and correcting or replacing affected computer systems or computerized devices became the major focus of information technology departments in most large companies and organizations. Millions of lines of programming code were reviewed and fixed during this period. Many corporations replaced major software systems with completely new ones that did not have the date processing problems. It was reported that corporations had <i>already</i> experienced minor Y2K problems due to date look-ahead functions in code and embedded systems, but it was and still is not clear what the full cost and seriousness of these problems were.</p>
<p>In some countries public apprehension was growing. Some individuals stockpiled canned or dried food in anticipation of food shortages. A few commentators predicted a full-scale <a href="/wiki/Apocalypse.html" title="Apocalypse">apocalypse</a>, among them computer consultant <a href="/wiki/Edward_Yourdon.html" title="Edward Yourdon">Edward Yourdon</a>, televangelist <a href="/wiki/Jack_Van_Impe.html" title="Jack Van Impe">Jack Van Impe</a>, religious commentator <a href="/wiki/Gary_North.html" title="Gary North">Gary North</a>, and economist <a  class="new" title="Edward Yardeni">Edward Yardeni</a>. In discussion groups devoted to the issue, this position was referred to by the acronym <a href="/wiki/TEOTWAWKI.html" title="TEOTWAWKI">TEOTWAWKI</a> for 'the end of the world as we know it', and those who held it were called <i>doomsayers</i>.</p>
<p>Another group of commentators argued that few or no problems would emerge, and that the appropriate policy response was not large-scale attempts to make systems Y2K-compliant, but a "fix on failure" response for all but the most critical systems. These commentators were often labelled <i><a href="/wiki/Pollyanna.html" title="Pollyanna">Pollyannas</a></i>.</p>
<p>The dominant view, which determined policy in the United States and other English-speaking countries, and to a lesser extent in the rest of the world was that the problem was sufficiently serious to justify a large-scale response, but that such a response should be sufficient to resolve the problem.</p>

<p>The total cost of the work done in preparation for Y2K was <a href="/wiki/%24US.html" title="$US">$US</a> 300 billion. <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/talking_point/586938.stm">[11]</a> There are two ways to view the events of 2000 from the perspective of its aftermath:</p>

<h3>Supporting view</h3>
<p>This view holds that the vast majority of problems had been fixed correctly, and the money was well spent. Those who hold this view claim that the lack of problems at the date change reflect the completeness of the project, and that many computer applications would not have continued to function into the 21st century without correction or remediation. This view was adopted by most of the (fairly limited) official examinations of Y2K projects undertaken after their completion. It has also been suggested that on <a href="/wiki/9/11.html" title="9/11">September 11, 2001</a>, the New York financial infrastructure was able to continue operation because of the redundant networks established in the event of Y2K bug impact. The terrorist attacks and the following prolonged blackout to lower Manhattan had minimal effect on global banking systems. Backup systems were activated at various locations around the region, many of which had been established to deal with a possible complete failure of networks in the financial district on <a href="/wiki/December_31.html" title="December 31">December 31</a>, <a href="/wiki/1999.html" title="1999">1999</a>. Had the emphasis on creating backup systems to deal with Y2K not occurred, much greater disruption to the economy could have occurred. Decentralization of infrastructure—in particular, the creation of multiple sites for backup data—helped keep banks up and running.</p>

<h3>Opposing view</h3>
<p>Others have claimed that there were no, or very few, critical problems to begin with, and that correcting the few minor mistakes as they occurred (the 'fix on failure' approach) would have been the most efficient and <a href="/wiki/Cost_effective.html" title="Cost effective">cost effective</a> way to solve the problem. This view was bolstered by a number of observations.</p>
<ul>
<li>The lack of Y2K-related problems in schools and small businesses, many of which undertook little or no remediation effort.</li>
<li>The lack of Y2K-related problems in countries such as <a href="/wiki/Italy.html" title="Italy">Italy</a>, which undertook a far more limited remediation effort than the United States</li>
<li>The lack of Y2K-related problems in the economically developing world, which in general had not devoted the programming resources to remediation that the industrialized West had marshalled.</li>
<li>The absence of Y2K-related problems occurring before January 1, 2000, even though the 2000 financial year commenced in 1999 in many jurisdictions, and a wide range of forward-looking calculations involved dates in 2000 and later years. Estimates undertaken in the leadup to 2000 suggested that around 25% of all problems should have occurred before 2000.<a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.enquirer.com/editions/1999/02/14/fin_lights_out_y2k.html">[12]</a>Critics of large scale remediation argued, during 1999, that the absence of significant problems, even in systems that had not been rendered compliant, suggested that the scale of the problem had been overestimated.<a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.uq.edu.au/economics/johnquiggin/news/Millennium9908.html">[13]</a></li>

<li>"I’m one of the culprits who created this problem. I used to write those programs back in the 1960’s and 1970’s, and was proud of the fact that I was able to squeeze a few elements of space out of my program by not having to put a 19 before the year. Back then, it was very important. We used to spend a lot of time running through various mathematical exercises before we started to write our programs so that they could be very clearly delimited with respect to space and the use of capacity.It never entered our minds that those programs would have lasted for more than a few years. As a consequence, they are very poorly documented. If I were to go back and look at some of the programs I wrote 30 years ago, I would have one terribly difficult time working my way thorough step-by-step."
