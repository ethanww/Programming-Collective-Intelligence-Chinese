<h3>Early years</h3>
<p>Ryanair was founded in 1985 by Christy Ryan (after whom the company is named), Liam Lonergan (owner of an Irish tour operator named Club Travel), and noted Irish businessman <a href="/wiki/Tony_Ryan.html" title="Tony Ryan">Tony Ryan</a>, founder of <a href="/wiki/Guinness_Peat_Aviation.html" title="Guinness Peat Aviation">Guinness Peat Aviation</a>. Christy Ryan was from Waterford and it was his idea to start an air service between Waterford and London <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://archives.tcm.ie/businesspost/2004/06/06/story57027153.asp">[4]</a>. The airline began with a 15 seat <a href="/wiki/Embraer.html" title="Embraer">Embraer</a> <a href="/wiki/Turboprop.html" title="Turboprop">turboprop</a> aircraft flying between <a href="/wiki/Waterford.html" title="Waterford">Waterford</a> and <a href="/wiki/Gatwick.html" title="Gatwick">London Gatwick</a> with the aim of breaking the <a href="/wiki/Duopoly.html" title="Duopoly">duopoly</a> on <a href="/wiki/London.html" title="London">London</a>-<a href="/wiki/Ireland.html" title="Ireland">Ireland</a> flights at that time held by <a href="/wiki/British_Airways.html" title="British Airways">British Airways</a> and <a href="/wiki/Aer_Lingus.html" title="Aer Lingus">Aer Lingus</a>. In 1986 the company added a second route – flying <a href="/wiki/Dublin.html" title="Dublin">Dublin</a>-<a href="/wiki/London_Luton_Airport.html" title="London Luton Airport">London Luton</a> in direct competition to the <a href="/wiki/British_Airways.html" title="British Airways">BA</a>/<a href="/wiki/Aer_Lingus.html" title="Aer Lingus">Aer Lingus</a> duopoly for the first time. Under partial EU Deregulation, airlines could begin new international intra-EU services as long as at least one of the two governments gave approval (the so-called "double-disapproval" regime). The Irish government at the time refused its approval in order to protect <a href="/wiki/Aer_Lingus.html" title="Aer Lingus">Aer Lingus</a>, but Britain, under <a href="/wiki/Margaret_Thatcher.html" title="Margaret Thatcher">Margaret Thatcher</a>'s pro-free-market <a href="/wiki/Conservative.html" title="Conservative">Conservative</a> government, approved the service. With two routes and two planes, the fledgling airline carried 82,000 passengers in one year.</p>

<p>Passenger numbers continued to increase, but the airline generally ran at a loss, and by 1991 was in need of restructuring. <a href="/wiki/Michael_O%27Leary_%28Ryanair%29.html" title="Michael O'Leary (Ryanair)">Michael O'Leary</a> was charged with the task of making the airline profitable. Ryan encouraged him to visit the USA to study the 'low fares/no frills' model being used by <a href="/wiki/Southwest_Airlines.html" title="Southwest Airlines">Southwest Airlines</a>. O'Leary quickly learnt that the key to low fares was to implement quick turn-around times for aircraft, "no frills", and no business class, as well as operating a single model of aircraft.</p>
<p>O'Leary returned - convinced that Ryanair could make huge inroads into the European air market, at that time dominated by national carriers which were subsidised to various degrees by their parent countries. He competed with the major airlines by providing a "no-frills", low-cost service. Flights were scheduled into regional airports, keen to attract new airlines, which offered lower landing and handling charges than larger established international airports. O'Leary as Chief Executive adopted a hands-on style of management, for example his publicity stunts in helping out with baggage handling on Ryanair flights at Dublin airport.</p>
<p>He is said to have a pugnacious and aggressive management style, using a flat management hierarchy. By 1995, after the consistent pursuit of its low-cost business model, Ryanair celebrated its 10th birthday by carrying 2.25 million passengers.<br style="clear:both" /></p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Deregulation and flotation">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Deregulation_and_flotation" id="Deregulation_and_flotation"></a></p>
<h3>Deregulation and flotation</h3>
<p><a href="/wiki/EU.html" title="EU">EU</a> deregulation of the air industry in Europe in 1997 gave carriers from one EU country the right to operate scheduled services between other EU states, and represented a major opportunity for Ryanair. After a successful flotation on the <a href="/wiki/ISEQ.html" title="ISEQ">Dublin Stock Exchange</a> and the <a href="/wiki/NASDAQ.html" title="NASDAQ">NASDAQ Stock exchanges</a>, the airline launched services to <a href="/wiki/Stockholm.html" title="Stockholm">Stockholm</a>, <a href="/wiki/Oslo.html" title="Oslo">Oslo</a> (<a href="/wiki/Sandefjord_Airport%2C_Torp.html" title="Sandefjord Airport, Torp">Sandefjord Airport, Torp</a>, 110&#160;km south of Oslo), <a href="/wiki/Paris.html" title="Paris">Paris</a> and <a href="/wiki/Charleroi.html" title="Charleroi">Charleroi</a> near <a href="/wiki/Brussels.html" title="Brussels">Brussels</a>. Flush with new capital, the airline placed a massive <a href="/wiki/US_dollar.html" title="US dollar">US$</a>2 <a href="/wiki/Billion.html" title="Billion">billion</a> order for 45 new <a href="/wiki/Boeing_737#737-800.html" title="Boeing 737">Boeing 737-800</a> series aircraft in 1998.</p>
<p>The airline launched its website in 2000, with online booking initially said to be a small and unimportant part of the software supporting the site. Increasingly the online booking contributed to the aim of cutting flight prices by selling direct to passengers and excluding the costs imposed by travel agents. Within a year the website was handling three-quarters of all bookings, and now accounts for 95% of the total.</p>

<p><a name="Expansion_into_Europe_and_fleet_growth" id="Expansion_into_Europe_and_fleet_growth"></a></p>
<h3>Expansion into Europe and fleet growth</h3>
<p>Ryanair launched a new hub of operation in <a href="/wiki/Charleroi_Brussels_South.html" title="Charleroi Brussels South">Charleroi Brussels South</a> in 2001. Later that year, the airline ordered 155 new <a href="/wiki/Boeing_737#737-800.html" title="Boeing 737">Boeing 737-800</a> series aircraft from <a href="/wiki/Boeing.html" title="Boeing">Boeing</a> at what was believed to be a substantial discount, (taking full advantage of the downturn in aeroplane orders after the slump in air travel following the September 2001 aircraft attacks in the United States) to be delivered over eight years from 2002 to 2010. Approximately 100 of these aircraft had been delivered by the end of 2005, although there were slight delays in late 2005 caused by production disruptions arising from a <a href="/wiki/Boeing.html" title="Boeing">Boeing</a> machinists' strike.</p>
<p>In 2002 Ryanair launched 26 new routes and established a hub in <a href="/wiki/Frankfurt-Hahn_Airport.html" title="Frankfurt-Hahn Airport">Frankfurt-Hahn Airport</a>, its European expansion firmly on track. In 2003, Ryanair announced the order of a further 100 new <a href="/wiki/Boeing_737#737-800.html" title="Boeing 737">Boeing 737-800</a> series aircraft from <a href="/wiki/Boeing.html" title="Boeing">Boeing</a>, and in February a third continental base was opened at <a href="/wiki/Orio_al_Serio_Airport.html" title="Orio al Serio Airport">Milan-Bergamo</a> in <a href="/wiki/Italy.html" title="Italy">Italy</a>.</p>

<p>In April 2003 Ryanair acquired its ailing competitor <a href="/wiki/Buzz_%28airline%29.html" title="Buzz (airline)">Buzz</a> from <a href="/wiki/KLM.html" title="KLM">KLM</a>, at a knock-down price. Expansion continued apace with the launch of a base at <a href="/wiki/Skavsta_Airport.html" title="Skavsta Airport">Stockholm (Skavsta)</a>, <a href="/wiki/Sweden.html" title="Sweden">Sweden</a>. By the end of 2003, the airline flew 127 routes, of which 60 had opened in the previous 12 months. The airline launched two more bases in the first half of 2004, at <a href="/wiki/Ciampino_Airport.html" title="Ciampino Airport">Rome (Ciampino)</a> and <a href="/wiki/Girona_Airport.html" title="Girona Airport">Barcelona (Girona)</a>, increasing the total to 11 hubs.</p>

<h3>Recent history</h3>
<p>During 2004, Michael O'Leary warned of a 'bloodbath' during the winter from which only two or three low-cost airlines would emerge, the expectation being that these would be Ryanair and <a href="/wiki/EasyJet.html" title="EasyJet">easyJet</a>. A modest loss of <a href="/wiki/Euro.html" title="Euro">€</a> 3.3 million in the second quarter of 2004 was the airline's first recorded loss for 15 years, indicating turbulent times in the low fares market.

Since that date, Ryanair has opened new routes to six of the ten new EU member states.</p>
<p>In February 2005, Ryanair announced an order for a further 70 Boeing 737-800 aircraft along with an option for a further 70. This is expected to allow Ryanair to increase passenger numbers from the 34 million expected in 2005 to 70 million in 2011. Some of these aircraft would be deployed at Ryanair's 12 European hubs, others to 10 new hubs they intend to establish over the next seven years. In an example of the airline's relentless prioritising of cost over all other factors, the aircraft will be delivered without window shades, seat back recline and seat back pockets, which result in savings of several hundred thousand dollars per aircraft and give continued savings through reduced cleaning and repair costs.</p>

<p><a name="Further_growth_in_2006" id="Further_growth_in_2006"></a></p>
<h2>Further growth in 2006</h2>
<p>In June 2006 the company announced that in the quarter ending 2006-06-30 its average yields were 13% higher than the same quarter of the previous year <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ryanair.com/site/EN/news.php?yr=06&amp;month=aug&amp;story=reg-en-010806">[5]</a> and its passenger numbers were up by 25% to 10.7 million, although year-on-year comparison was difficult because of the movement of Easter from first quarter 2005 to second quarter 2006. Net profits (€115.7m) increased by 80% over the same quarter in 2005. Management indicated that this level of growth may not be sustained for the remainder of this year, despite adding 27 new aircraft and opening new routes.</p>
<p>Ryanair's passenger numbers have grown by up to 25% a year for most of the last decade. Carrying under 0.7 million annually in its early years, passenger figures grew to 21.4 million in 2003. The rapid addition of new routes and new hubs has enabled this growth in passenger numbers, and Ryanair is now among the largest carriers on European routes. In August 2004, the airline carried 20% more passengers within Europe than British Airways.</p>

<p><a name="Criticisms_and_complaints" id="Criticisms_and_complaints"></a></p>
<h2>Criticisms and complaints</h2>
<p>Ryanair has been heavily criticised throughout the low-cost part of its history for many of its practices. In a number of incidents it has responded stubbornly to relatively trivial matters, often to make a point about the constant need to avoid adding "frills" to its service. In 2004, a website, Ryanair Campaign, appeared that seeks to publicise Ryanair's alleged ill treatment of its passengers, but Ryanair's lawyers have come down upon it heavily. In August 2006, Ryanair succeed in an appeal to <a href="/wiki/Nominet.html" title="Nominet">Nominet</a> to gain control of the domain name that the Ryanair Campaign website was using. The owners then moved the site to <a  class="external free" title="http://www.ryanaircampaign.org/">http://www.ryanaircampaign.org/</a>.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Customer service">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Customer_service" id="Customer_service"></a></p>
<h3>Customer service</h3>
<p>Critics have accused Ryanair of poor treatment of customers whose flights have been cancelled <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.airlinequality.com/Forum/ryan.htm">[6]</a>. The airline formerly refused to provide accommodation or meal vouchers when flights were cancelled or delayed, a practice which became illegal within the EU on <a href="/wiki/February_17.html" title="February 17">February 17</a>, <a href="/wiki/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a> <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://europa.eu.int/eur-lex/lex/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32004R0261:EN:HTML">[7]</a>. Ryanair also refuses to refund taxes and fees when passengers cancel their tickets. Recently they revised their practice on this subject by introducing an administration fee of £14 per ticket for handling refunds, a fee which exceeds the amount the passengers may be eligible for. Norwegian consumer authorities have fined Ryanair £43,000 for this practice <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://forbruker.no/reise/article1216910.ece">[8]</a>.</p>
<p>Having complained about having to compensate customers for cancelled or delayed flights Ryanair is now suing the UK government for compensation for losses it claims it incurred through cancelled or delayed flights over the recent (August 2006) security alerts. Some people think Ryanair should look to its own policies, and drop its claim.</p>
<p>In common with other airlines, Ryanair also sometimes makes changes to its flight times at relatively short notice. However, two factors make this particularly problematic in the case of <a href="/wiki/Low_cost_carrier.html" title="Low cost carrier">low-cost carriers</a> in general and Ryanair in particular:</p>
<ul>
<li>the company notifies affected passengers by email rather than by telephone, so there is sometimes a delay before the passenger learns of the change;</li>
<li>because Ryanair does not provide connecting flights, many passengers make their own connections by booking separate tickets. If the Ryanair flight time change makes the connection impossible, the passenger loses the cost of the connecting flight unless this is covered by travel <a href="/wiki/Insurance.html" title="Insurance">insurance</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The airline has come under heavy criticism in the past for its poor treatment of disabled passengers. In 2002 it refused to provide <a href="/wiki/Wheelchair.html" title="Wheelchair">wheelchairs</a> for disabled passengers at <a href="/wiki/Stansted_Airport.html" title="Stansted Airport">Stansted Airport</a>, greatly angering disabled rights groups <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.drc-gb.org/newsroom/newsdetails.asp?print=true&amp;id=773&amp;section=1">[9]</a>. The airline argued that this provision was the responsibility of the airport authority stating that wheelchairs were provided by 87 of the 93 Ryanair destination airports. A court ruling in 2004 judged that the responsibility should be shared by the airline and the airport owners <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4112791.stm">[10]</a>; Ryanair responded by adding a surcharge of <a href="/wiki/Pound_Sterling.html" title="Pound Sterling">£</a> 0.50 to all its flight costs. In 2005, the airline was criticised for ejecting nine blind and partially sighted passengers from a flight at Stansted, because the group meant the plane would be carrying more than the four disabled passengers permitted by the airline's safety regulations. <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/this_britain/article319157.ece">[11]</a></p>

<p><a name="Airports" id="Airports"></a></p>
<h3>Airports</h3>
<p>Ryanair has been accused of flying to regional airports which, while cheap, are usually very far away from the cities they claim to serve. For example, the airline used to advertise a service to <a href="/wiki/Malm%C3%B6-Sturup_Airport.html" title="Malmö-Sturup Airport">Malmö-Sturup Airport</a>, in <a href="/wiki/Sweden.html" title="Sweden">Sweden</a>, as "<a href="/wiki/Copenhagen.html" title="Copenhagen">Copenhagen</a>", <a href="/wiki/Denmark.html" title="Denmark">Denmark</a> (65&#160;<a href="/wiki/Kilometre.html" title="Kilometre">km</a> away).</p>
<p>In some cases the names were eventually changed by legal action (e.g. "<a href="/wiki/Airport_Weeze.html" title="Airport Weeze">Düsseldorf (Niederrhein)</a>" and "St. Étienne (Lyons)"), but in other cases courts have upheld the designated name — this was the case for <a href="/wiki/Frankfurt-Hahn_Airport.html" title="Frankfurt-Hahn Airport">Frankfurt-Hahn Airport</a>, over 140&#160;km (83 miles) from central <a href="/wiki/Frankfurt.html" title="Frankfurt">Frankfurt</a>, or San Javier Airport (Alicante sur) , in <a href="/wiki/Murcia_%28autonomous_community%29.html" title="Murcia (autonomous community)">Region of Murcia</a>, over 100&#160;km from <a href="/wiki/Alicante.html" title="Alicante">Alicante</a> city.</p>
<p>In February 2005 Ryanair published an advertisement in Norway's <i>Aftenposten</i> erroneously featuring flights from Oslo to <i>London Prestwick</i>: <a href="/wiki/Prestwick_Airport.html" title="Prestwick Airport">Prestwick Airport</a> is near <a href="/wiki/Glasgow.html" title="Glasgow">Glasgow</a>, 600&#160;km from London <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/news/archives/2006/02/09/a_wee_trip_to_london.html#more">[12]</a><a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2006/02/09/nryan09.xml">[13]</a>. The company said that the advertisement was a typing error.</p>
<p>However, the carrier also serves important cities where the airport's runway is too short for its Boeing 737-800 to fly there. Deauville airport is indeed located not far from Caen, le Havre and Rouen.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Union issues">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Union_issues" id="Union_issues"></a></p>
<h3>Union issues</h3>
<p>Ryanair has come under fire from unions representing workers in the airline industry for refusing to recognise trade unions and allegedly providing poor working conditions (for example, staff are banned from charging their own mobile phones at work to reduce the company's electricity bill <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/beds/bucks/herts/4471833.stm">[14]</a>).</p>
<p>Ryanair has attempted to pressure employees not to unionise, according to the Ryan Be Fair website <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ryan-be-fair.org/news/current_situation.htm">[15]</a>, set up and run by employees to improve working conditions.</p>
<p>Ryanair does not recognise the Irish Airline Pilots' Association (IALPA), although it is the largest pilots' union in Ireland <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://archives.tcm.ie/businesspost/2000/10/22/story853138.asp">[16]</a>.</p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/January_25.html" title="January 25">25 January</a> <a href="/wiki/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a> the Irish Labour Court guaranteed an investigation into allegations of victimisation of staff who wished to join a trade union <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ryan-be-fair.org/news/ialpa.htm">[17]</a>.</p>
<p>In July 2006, an Irish High Court judge found that Ryanair had bullied pilots to force them to agree to new contracts, and that some Ryanair managers had given false evidence in court <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://home.eircom.net/content/irelandcom/topstories/8514314?view=Eircomnet">[18]</a>.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Subsidies">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Subsidies" id="Subsidies"></a></p>
<h3>Subsidies</h3>
<p>Ryanair receives subsidies from some European airports, a situation which has been investigated by the <a href="/wiki/European_Commission.html" title="European Commission">European Commission</a>. The EC believes that subsidies from state-owned airports are potentially in breach of European Union competition rules unless they follow strict guidelines.</p>
<p>In February 2004 the European Commission ruled that <a href="/wiki/Charleroi.html" title="Charleroi">Charleroi</a> airport gave Ryanair illegal subsidies and ordered the airline to repay roughly €4 million of subsidies. <a href="/wiki/Walloons.html" title="Walloons">Walloon</a> authorities who offered the subsidies were considering appealing against the ruling because of the roughly €45 million that the airline route brings to the area every year.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Disguising fares as taxes">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Disguising_fares_as_taxes" id="Disguising_fares_as_taxes"></a></p>
<h3>Disguising fares as taxes</h3>
<p>The UK newspaper <a href="/wiki/The_Guardian.html" title="The Guardian">The Guardian</a> has alleged <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://business.guardian.co.uk/story/0,,1769707,00.html">[19]</a> that the insurance fee which Ryanair charges each passenger (charged on every passenger booking together with other additional travel taxes and charges) is unreasonably high.</p>
<p>The insurance surcharge amounted to more than 10% of Ryanair's average fare, the newspaper estimated.</p>
<p>Ryanair declined to disclose its exact outlay on insurance. <a href="/wiki/The_Guardian.html" title="The Guardian">The Guardian</a> estimates that in the year to March 2005 passengers would have paid £87 million in surcharges. EasyJet, which has a similarly sized fleet, paid £19 million for 2005 disaster insurance.</p>
<p>Ryanair introduced insurance surcharge in the wake of the terrorist attacks of September 11th, 2001 to cover a spike in the cost of insuring aeroplanes. The charge was initially £1.85 but has since increased by 70% to £3.15 (May 2006). Experts claim that during the period the cost of cover has actually fallen to relatively normal rates.</p>
<p>Rivals easyJet spoksman claimed that "Ryanair's insurance charges appear to be far higher than they actually incur (…) Either this is poor cost management on Ryanair's behalf or it's a fuel surcharge in disguise."</p>
<p>Ryanair retaliated by pointing out that, even with taxes included, their average fare is well below easyJet. Ryanair spokesman Peter Sherrard said easyJet "charged each passenger last year £14 more per ticket than Ryanair thereby overcharging their passengers by £413 million".</p>
<p>Also, campaigners for the disabled accused Ryanair of profiteering from another part of "taxes and charges" tab – the £0.33 wheelchair levy. <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/main.jhtml?xml=/travel/2006/05/13/etnewsryan.xml&amp;sSheet=/travel/2006/05/13/ixtrvhome.html">[20]</a> The levy is used to cover the cost of transporting disabled passengers onto its planes. Ryanair is the only major airline operating in Britain to impose such charges.</p>
<p>The UK newspaper <a href="/wiki/The_Daily_Telegraph.html" title="The Daily Telegraph">The Daily Telegraph</a> estimates that in 12 months up to May 2006 Ryanair received nearly £12 million through the levy. The governmental body Disability Rights Commission (DRC), which analysed the 2004 Stansted airport practice data, said that the levy should be no more than 2p – the company would still have collected £700,000 this way.</p>
<p>The Telegraph quoted Michael O'Leary defending Ryanair's position: "We estimate it costs £25 [per person] to transport disabled passengers at Stansted, and we carry 1.5 million such passengers every year."</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/British_Airways.html" title="British Airways">British Airways</a> said it had absorbed cost to transport disabled travellers into its ticket prices. EasyJet estimated that services for the disabled added no more than 10p to the price of a ticket.</p>

<p><a name="Other_criticisms" id="Other_criticisms"></a></p>
<h3>Other criticisms</h3>
<p>Also criticised are what are seen as vitriolic attacks on opponents, notably former Irish Minister for Transport <a href="/wiki/Mary_O%27Rourke.html" title="Mary O'Rourke">Mary O'Rourke</a> (1997-2002), who was personally ridiculed in a series of controversial newspaper advertisements when she refused to break up the state monopoly which then ran Irish airports, <a href="/wiki/Aer_Rianta.html" title="Aer Rianta">Aer Rianta</a>. (The break-up of Aer Rianta remains a high-profile demand for Michael O'Leary. Under the State Airports Act 2004, Aer Rianta has been renamed Dublin Airport Authority, although as of April 2006 Cork and Shannon airports had not yet been given autonomy pending resolution of a dispute over debt transfers).</p>
<p>Ryanair does not employ an advertising agency, instead producing all its advertising material in-house. Michael O'Leary often states that the airline goes to extremes to make a point, an approach which has resulted in Ryanair's advertising occasionally being considered offensive <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.brandchannel.com/features_effect.asp?pf_id=49">[21]</a> <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/3456423.stm">[22]</a>.</p>
<p>In 2002 Ryanair reneged on a promise of free flights given as a prize to the airline's one millionth passenger, Jane O'Keeffe. She received the prize in 1988, and had been using it for several flights every year, but the airline refused to carry her free of charge on a flight in 2002. The woman eventually went to court and won an award of €67,500. <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.rte.ie/news/2002/0228/ryanair.html">[23]</a> <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ananova.com/business/story/sm_611142.html">[24]</a></p>
<p>In the first quarter of 2006, a substantial number of Ryanair flights were cancelled, with passengers receiving refunds or being rebooked. Ryanair's explanation was that these cancellations were the result of late aircraft deliveries due to the Boeing machinists' strike <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ryanair.com/site/EN/news.php?yr=05&amp;month=dec&amp;story=gen-en-201205">[25]</a>. However, other sources such as pilot forums <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.pprune.org/forums/showthread.php?t=206892&amp;highlight=Ryanair">[26]</a> suggest that some of the cancellations were due to pilots reaching their annual 900-hour duty time limits earlier than anticipated, since the airline's duty-time year runs from April 1 to March 31. Whatever the cause, a number of other carriers operated wet-lease services for Ryanair during the first three months of 2006. One of these, <a href="/wiki/Eirjet.html" title="Eirjet">Eirjet</a>, was involved in an incident on March 29 (see below).</p>

Two undercover reporters obtained jobs as cabin crew based at Ryanair's operations at London Stansted Airport and secretly recorded the training programme, and cabin crew procedures. The documentary criticised Ryanair's training policies, security procedures, aircraft hygiene, and highlighted poor staff morale. It filmed Ryanair cabin crew sleeping on the job; using aftershave to cover the smell of <a href="/wiki/Vomit.html" title="Vomit">vomit</a> in the aisle rather than cleaning it up; ignoring warning alerts on the emergency slide; encouraging staff to falsify references for airport security passes; and asking staff not to recheck passengers' passports before they board flights.

<p>Among Ryanair's main low-cost <a href="/wiki/Competitor.html" title="Competitor">competitors</a> are <a href="/wiki/EasyJet.html" title="EasyJet">easyJet</a>, <a href="/wiki/Air_Berlin.html" title="Air Berlin">Air Berlin</a>, <a href="/wiki/Germanwings.html" title="Germanwings">Germanwings</a>, <a href="/wiki/Transavia.html" title="Transavia">Transavia</a>, <a href="/wiki/Bmibaby.html" title="Bmibaby">bmibaby</a>, <a href="/wiki/Jet2.html" title="Jet2">Jet2</a>, <a href="/wiki/SkyEurope.html" title="SkyEurope">SkyEurope</a>, <a href="/wiki/Vueling.html" title="Vueling">Vueling</a>, <a href="/wiki/Wizz_Air.html" title="Wizz Air">Wizz Air</a>, <a href="/wiki/Flybe.html" title="Flybe">Flybe</a>, <a href="/wiki/Thomsonfly.html" title="Thomsonfly">Thomsonfly</a> and <a href="/wiki/HLX.com.html" title="HLX.com">HLX.com</a>. In 2004 approximately 60 new low-cost airlines were formed. Despite traditionally being a full-service airline, <a href="/wiki/Aer_Lingus.html" title="Aer Lingus">Aer Lingus</a> moved to a low-fares strategy from 2002, leading to much more intense competition with Ryanair on Irish routes.</p>
<p>Airlines which attempt to compete directly with Ryanair are treated harshly, with Ryanair reducing fares to significantly undercut their competitors. In response to MyTravelLite, who started to compete with Ryanair on the Birmingham to Dublin route in 2003, Ryanair set up competing flights on some of MyTravelLite's routes until they pulled out. <a href="/wiki/Go_Fly.html" title="Go Fly">Go</a> was another airline which attempted to offer services from Ryanair's hub at Dublin to Glasgow and Edinburgh in <a href="/wiki/Scotland.html" title="Scotland">Scotland</a>. A fierce battle ensued, which ended with Go withdrawing its service from Dublin. <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://archives.tcm.ie/businesspost/2003/11/30/story361140301.asp">[38]</a></p>
<p>In September 2004, Ryanair's biggest competitor, <a href="/wiki/EasyJet.html" title="EasyJet">easyJet</a>, announced routes to the <a href="/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland.html" title="Republic of Ireland">Republic of Ireland</a> for the first time, beginning with the Cork to London Gatwick route – until then easyJet had never competed directly with Ryanair on its home ground. Easyjet announced in July 2006 that it was withdrawing its Gatwick-Cork, Gatwick-Shannon and Gatwick-Knock services; within two weeks Ryanair also announced it would withdraw its own service on the Gatwick-Knock and Luton-Shannon routes.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/DFDS.html" title="DFDS">DFDS Seaways</a> cited competition from low-cost air services, especially Ryanair (which now flies to <a href="/wiki/Glasgow_Prestwick.html" title="Glasgow Prestwick">Glasgow Prestwick</a> and <a href="/wiki/London_Stansted.html" title="London Stansted">London Stansted</a> from <a href="/wiki/Gothenburg_City_Airport.html" title="Gothenburg City Airport">Gothenburg City Airport</a>), as being the reason for its scrapping the <a href="/wiki/Newcastle-upon-Tyne.html" title="Newcastle-upon-Tyne">Newcastle</a>-<a href="/wiki/Gothenburg.html" title="Gothenburg">Gothenburg</a> ferry service in October 2006<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a  title="">[1]</a></sup>. It was the only dedicated passenger ferry service between <a href="/wiki/Sweden.html" title="Sweden">Sweden</a> and the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom.html" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>, and had been running since the 19th century (under various operators).</p>

<p>Ryanair serves 362 routes between 130 airports in 20 European countries and three in <a href="/wiki/Morocco.html" title="Morocco">Morocco</a>. Its main hub is <a href="/wiki/London_Stansted_Airport.html" title="London Stansted Airport">London Stansted Airport</a>, with 88 routes.

<p>Most regional airports from which Ryanair operates to are located very far from the city centres than their main airports, with <a href="/wiki/Frankfurt-Hahn_Airport.html" title="Frankfurt-Hahn Airport">Frankfurt-Hahn</a> perhaps the most notorious example, 140&#160;km west of <a href="/wiki/Frankfurt.html" title="Frankfurt">Frankfurt</a>. There are however rare exceptions: <a href="/wiki/Gothenburg_City_Airport.html" title="Gothenburg City Airport">Gothenburg City Airport</a> is 11&#160;km closer to <a href="/wiki/Gothenburg.html" title="Gothenburg">Gothenburg</a> than the main <a href="/wiki/Gothenburg-Landvetter_Airport.html" title="Gothenburg-Landvetter Airport">Landvetter Airport</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Ciampino_Airport.html" title="Ciampino Airport">Ciampino Airport</a> is 17&#160;km closer to <a href="/wiki/Rome.html" title="Rome">Rome</a> than the main <a href="/wiki/Leonardo_Da_Vinci_International_Airport.html" title="Leonardo Da Vinci International Airport">Leonardo Da Vinci International Airport</a>, although the latter is better connected.</p>
<p>The airline's first new routes outside Europe start in October 2006 when Ryanair plan to begin flying from Frankfurt-Hahn to <a href="/wiki/Marrakech.html" title="Marrakech">Marrakech</a> and Fez, both in <a href="/wiki/Morocco.html" title="Morocco">Morocco</a>. These non-European routes will be further complemented from November 2006 when Ryanair begins flights from <a href="/wiki/Marseille.html" title="Marseille">Marseille</a> to <a href="/wiki/Fez.html" title="Fez">Fez</a>, <a href="/wiki/Marrakech.html" title="Marrakech">Marrakech</a> and <a href="/wiki/Oujda.html" title="Oujda">Oujda</a> (all in <a href="/wiki/Morocco.html" title="Morocco">Morocco</a>). Ryanair also announced it would begin flying 10 other routes from Marseille and that it would make Marseille its 16th operational base, with 2 <a href="/wiki/Boeing_737#737-800.html" title="Boeing 737">Boeing 737-800</a> to be based there.<a  class="external text" title="http://www.ryanair.com/site/EN/news.php?yr=06&amp;month=may&amp;story=rte-en-100506">New flights to Morocco News Release</a></p>
<p>Of all Ryanair's routes, the Dublin-London city pair remains both the busiest and the most profitable. This is largely due to the number of Irish people who live in the UK, the amount of business between the two cities, and increasingly the number of Irish who use the route to make connecting flights to other points in Europe. In terms of air passenger traffic, London-Dublin is the busiest international city pair in the world after Hong Kong-Taipei. <sup title="The text in the vicinity of this tag needs citation." class="noprint">[<a  title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><i>citation&#160;needed</i></a>]</sup></p>
<p>Ryanair negotiates extremely aggressive contracts with its airports, demanding very low landing and handling fees as well as financial assistance with marketing and promotional campaigns. In subsequent contract renewal negotiations, the airline plays airports off against each other, threatening to withdraw services and deploy the aircraft elsewhere if the airport does not make further concessions. In April 2006, a failure to reach agreement on a new commercial contract resulted in Ryanair announcing that it would withdraw service on the Dublin-Cardiff route at short notice <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/south_east/4944784.stm">[39]</a>. The airport management rebutted Ryanair's assertion that airport charges were unreasonably high, noting that Cardiff charges were already below Ryanair's average, and claimed that Ryanair had recently adopted the same negotiating approach with <a href="/wiki/Cork_Airport.html" title="Cork Airport">Cork Airport</a> and <a href="/wiki/London_Stansted_Airport.html" title="London Stansted Airport">London Stansted Airport</a> <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://info.cwlfly.com/en/news.asp?id=203">[40]</a>.</p>
<p>Ryanair was forced to give up its <a href="/wiki/Ciampino_Airport.html" title="Ciampino Airport">Rome Ciampino</a>-<a href="/wiki/Alghero.html" title="Alghero">Alghero</a> route after the route was allocated to <a href="/wiki/Air_One.html" title="Air One">Air One</a> as a <a href="/wiki/Public_Service_Obligation.html" title="Public Service Obligation">Public Service Obligation</a> (PSO) route. The <a href="/wiki/European_Commission.html" title="European Commission">European Commission</a> is currently investigating the actions of the <a href="/wiki/Italy.html" title="Italy">Italian</a> Government in assigning PSO routes and thus restricting <a href="/wiki/Competition.html" title="Competition">competition</a>.</p>
