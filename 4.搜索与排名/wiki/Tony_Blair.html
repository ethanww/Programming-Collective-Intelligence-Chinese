<p>Blair became leader of the British <a href="/wiki/Labour_Party_%28UK%29.html" title="Labour Party (UK)">Labour Party</a> in July 1994 following the sudden death of his predecessor, <a href="/wiki/John_Smith_%28UK_politician%29.html" title="John Smith (UK politician)">John Smith</a>. Under his leadership, the party won a <a href="/wiki/Landslide_victory.html" title="Landslide victory">landslide victory</a> in the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election%2C_1997.html" title="United Kingdom general election, 1997">1997 general election</a> on <a href="/wiki/May_1.html" title="May 1">1 May</a>, ending 18 years of government by the UK's centre-right <a href="/wiki/Conservative_Party_%28UK%29.html" title="Conservative Party (UK)">Conservative Party</a>. Blair is the Labour Party's longest-serving Prime Minister, and the only person to have led the party to three consecutive general election victories and the only Labour prime minister to serve more than one full consecutive term. He was the youngest person to attain the office of Prime Minister since <a href="/wiki/Robert_Jenkinson%2C_2nd_Earl_of_Liverpool.html" title="Robert Jenkinson, 2nd Earl of Liverpool">Lord Liverpool</a> in 1812.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a  title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Together with <a href="/wiki/Gordon_Brown.html" title="Gordon Brown">Gordon Brown</a> and <a href="/wiki/Peter_Mandelson.html" title="Peter Mandelson">Peter Mandelson</a>, Blair is both credited with and blamed for moving the Labour Party towards the <a href="/wiki/Political_centre.html" title="Political centre">centre</a> of British politics, using the term "<a href="/wiki/Labour_Party_%28UK%29#New_Labour.html" title="Labour Party (UK)">New Labour</a>" to distinguish his pro-<a href="/wiki/Free_market.html" title="Free market">market</a> policies from the more <a href="/wiki/Collectivism.html" title="Collectivism">collectivist</a> policies which the party had espoused in the past. This change is comparable to the centrist reforms in the <a href="/wiki/United_States_of_America.html" title="United States of America">American</a> <a href="/wiki/Democratic_Party_%28United_States%29.html" title="Democratic Party (United States)">Democratic Party</a> associated with <a href="/wiki/Bill_Clinton.html" title="Bill Clinton">Bill Clinton</a> and the <a href="/wiki/New_Democrats.html" title="New Democrats">New Democrats</a>, relative to the political and cultural differences between British and American society. Blair has described his political philosophy as "modern <a href="/wiki/Social_democracy.html" title="Social democracy">social democracy</a>" and "<a href="/wiki/Third_Way.html" title="Third Way">the third way</a>".</p>
<p>Blair has strongly supported a number of aspects of US foreign policy, notably by participating in the invasions of <a href="/wiki/United_States_invasion_of_Afghanistan.html" title="United States invasion of Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a> in 2001 and <a href="/wiki/2003_invasion_of_Iraq.html" title="2003 invasion of Iraq">Iraq</a> in 2003. He has encountered fierce criticism as a result, and the circumstances in which he took Britain to war in Iraq have caused many opponents of the war to perceive him as dishonest.</p>
<p>In October 2004, Blair stated that he would not serve a fourth term as Prime Minister. This has led to speculation as to how long his leadership would continue; by law the next general election must be held by <a href="/wiki/June_3.html" title="June 3">3 June</a> <a href="/wiki/2010.html" title="2010">2010</a>. On <a href="/wiki/May_14.html" title="May 14">14 May</a> <a href="/wiki/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>, the <i><a href="/wiki/Independent_on_Sunday.html" title="Independent on Sunday">Independent on Sunday</a></i> reported that Blair had privately assured ministers that he would step down in the summer of 2007<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a  title="">[3]</a></sup>. It is widely predicted that he will be succeeded as leader of the <a href="/wiki/Labour_Party_%28UK%29.html" title="Labour Party (UK)">Labour Party</a> by the <a href="/wiki/Chancellor_of_the_Exchequer.html" title="Chancellor of the Exchequer">Chancellor of the Exchequer</a> <a href="/wiki/Gordon_Brown.html" title="Gordon Brown">Gordon Brown</a>, with much speculation that the date will be <a href="/wiki/May_31.html" title="May 31">31 May</a> <a href="/wiki/2007.html" title="2007">2007</a> <sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a  title="">[4]</a></sup>.

<h2>Family background</h2>
<p>Blair was born at the Queen Mary Maternity Home<sup id="_ref-Edinburgh_Evening-birthplace_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[6]</a></sup> in <a href="/wiki/Edinburgh.html" title="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a>, <a href="/wiki/Scotland.html" title="Scotland">Scotland</a>, the second son of <a href="/wiki/Leo_Blair_%28senior%29.html" title="Leo Blair (senior)">Leo</a> and Hazel Blair (née Corscadden). He has one elder brother, <a href="/wiki/William_Blair_%28barrister%29.html" title="William Blair (barrister)">William Blair</a>, who is a <a href="/wiki/Barrister.html" title="Barrister">barrister</a> and a <a href="/wiki/Queen%27s_Counsel.html" title="Queen's Counsel">Queen's Counsel (QC)</a>. Blair spent the first 19 months of his life at the family home in Paisley Terrace in the <a  class="new" title="Willowbrae">Willowbrae</a> area of Edinburgh. During this period his father worked as a junior tax inspector whilst also studying for a law degree from the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Edinburgh.html" title="University of Edinburgh">University of Edinburgh</a>.<sup id="_ref-Edinburgh_Evening-birthplace_1" class="reference"><a  title="">[6]</a></sup> His family spent three and a half years in the 1950s living in <a href="/wiki/Adelaide.html" title="Adelaide">Adelaide</a>, <a href="/wiki/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australia</a>, where his father was a lecturer in law at the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Adelaide.html" title="University of Adelaide">University of Adelaide</a>.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a  title="">[7]</a></sup> The Blairs lived close to the university, in the suburb of <a href="/wiki/Dulwich%2C_South_Australia.html" title="Dulwich, South Australia">Dulwich</a>.</p>
<p>The family returned to Britain in the late 1950s, living for a time with Hazel Blair's parents at their home in <a  class="new" title="Stepps">Stepps</a>, near <a href="/wiki/Glasgow.html" title="Glasgow">Glasgow</a>. Blair spent the remainder of his childhood in <a href="/wiki/Durham.html" title="Durham">Durham</a>, <a href="/wiki/England.html" title="England">England</a>, his father being by then a lecturer at <a href="/wiki/Durham_University.html" title="Durham University">Durham University</a>. After attending Durham's <a href="/wiki/Chorister_School.html" title="Chorister School">Chorister School</a> Blair boarded at <a href="/wiki/Fettes_College.html" title="Fettes College">Fettes College</a>, a <a  class="new" title="Fee-paying school">fee-paying school</a> in Edinburgh, where he met <a href="/wiki/Charlie_Falconer.html" title="Charlie Falconer">Charlie Falconer</a>, whom he later appointed <a href="/wiki/Lord_Chancellor.html" title="Lord Chancellor">Lord Chancellor</a>. Blair reportedly modelled himself on <a href="/wiki/Mick_Jagger.html" title="Mick Jagger">Mick Jagger</a>, and is said to have enjoyed a reputation as a conspicuously "<a href="/wiki/Cool_%28aesthetic%29.html" title="Cool (aesthetic)">cool</a>" young man among his fellow pupils. His teachers, however, were less impressed by his behaviour: his biographer John Rentoul reported that "All the teachers I spoke to... said he was a complete pain in the backside, and they were very glad to see the back of him."</p>
<p>After Fettes, Blair spent a year in London, where he attempted to find fame as a rock music promoter, before going up to <a href="/wiki/University_of_Oxford.html" title="University of Oxford">Oxford University</a> to <a href="/wiki/Reading_for_a_degree.html" title="Reading for a degree">read</a> law at <a href="/wiki/St_John%27s_College%2C_Oxford.html" title="St John's College, Oxford">St John's College</a>. As a student, he played <a href="/wiki/Guitar.html" title="Guitar">guitar</a> and sang for a <a href="/wiki/Rock_band.html" title="Rock band">rock band</a> called <a href="/wiki/Ugly_Rumours.html" title="Ugly Rumours">Ugly Rumours</a>. During this time, he dated future <a href="/wiki/American_Psycho.html" title="American Psycho">American Psycho</a> director <a href="/wiki/Mary_Harron.html" title="Mary Harron">Mary Harron</a>.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a  title="">[8]</a></sup> After graduating from Oxford with a <a href="/wiki/British_undergraduate_degree_classification.html" title="British undergraduate degree classification">second class degree</a>, Blair enrolled as a pupil barrister and met his future wife, <a href="/wiki/Cherie_Blair.html" title="Cherie Blair">Cherie Booth</a>, at the <a href="/wiki/11_King%27s_Bench_Walk_Chambers.html" title="11 King's Bench Walk Chambers">Chambers</a> founded by <a href="/wiki/Derry_Irvine.html" title="Derry Irvine">Derry Irvine</a>, who was to be his first Lord Chancellor. His biographer Rentoul records that, according to his lawyer friends, Blair voiced much less concern regarding party affiliation than to his aim of becoming Prime Minister.</p>
<p>Blair married Booth, a practising <a href="/wiki/Roman_Catholic_Church.html" title="Roman Catholic Church">Roman Catholic</a> and future <a href="/wiki/Queen%27s_Counsel.html" title="Queen's Counsel">Queen's Counsel</a>, on <a href="/wiki/March_29.html" title="March 29">29 March</a> <a href="/wiki/1980.html" title="1980">1980</a>. They have three children (<a href="/wiki/Euan_Blair.html" title="Euan Blair">Euan</a>, <a href="/wiki/Nicky_Blair.html" title="Nicky Blair">Nicky</a>, <a href="/wiki/Kathryn_Blair.html" title="Kathryn Blair">Kathryn</a> and <a href="/wiki/Leo_Blair.html" title="Leo Blair">Leo</a>). Leo (born <a href="/wiki/May_20.html" title="May 20">20 May</a> <a href="/wiki/2000.html" title="2000">2000</a>) was the first legitimate child born to a serving Prime Minister in over 150 years, since Francis Russell was born to <a href="/wiki/John_Russell%2C_1st_Earl_Russell.html" title="John Russell, 1st Earl Russell">Lord John Russell</a> on <a href="/wiki/July_11.html" title="July 11">11 July</a> <a href="/wiki/1849.html" title="1849">1849</a>.</p>
<p>Although the Blairs stated that they had wished to shield their children from the media, Euan and Nicky's education was a cause of political controversy. They both attended the Catholic <a href="/wiki/London_Oratory_School.html" title="London Oratory School">London Oratory School</a>, which had been criticised by left-wingers for the perceived elitism of its selection procedures. The Blairs chose this school over a Catholic school in Labour-controlled <a href="/wiki/London_Borough_of_Islington.html" title="London Borough of Islington">Islington</a>, where they then lived. There was further criticism from the left when it was revealed that Euan received private coaching from the staff of the fee-paying <a href="/wiki/Westminster_School.html" title="Westminster School">Westminster School</a>.</p>

<p>Blair joined the <a href="/wiki/Labour_Party_%28UK%29.html" title="Labour Party (UK)">Labour Party</a> shortly after graduating from Oxford in 1975. During the early 1980s, he was involved in Labour politics in <a href="/wiki/Hackney_South_and_Shoreditch_%28UK_Parliament_constituency%29.html" title="Hackney South and Shoreditch (UK Parliament constituency)">Hackney South and Shoreditch</a>, where he aligned himself with the "<a href="/wiki/Soft_left.html" title="Soft left">soft left</a>" of the party. He unsuccessfully attempted to secure selection as a candidate for <a href="/wiki/London_Borough_of_Hackney.html" title="London Borough of Hackney">Hackney Borough Council</a>. Through his father-in-law, the actor <a href="/wiki/Anthony_Booth.html" title="Anthony Booth">Tony Booth</a>, he contacted Labour MP <a href="/wiki/Tom_Pendry.html" title="Tom Pendry">Tom Pendry</a> to ask for help in pursuing a Parliamentary career. Pendry gave him a tour of the House of Commons and advised him to stand for selection as a candidate in the forthcoming <a href="/wiki/By-election.html" title="By-election">by-election</a> in the safe <a href="/wiki/Conservative_Party_%28UK%29.html" title="Conservative Party (UK)">Conservative</a> seat of <a href="/wiki/Beaconsfield_%28UK_Parliament_constituency%29.html" title="Beaconsfield (UK Parliament constituency)">Beaconsfield</a>, where Pendry knew a senior member of the local party. Blair was chosen as the candidate; he won only 10% of the vote and lost his deposit, but he impressed Labour Party leader <a href="/wiki/Michael_Foot.html" title="Michael Foot">Michael Foot</a> and acquired a profile within the party. In contrast to his later centrism, Blair described himself in this period as a <a href="/wiki/Socialism.html" title="Socialism">Socialist</a>. A letter that he wrote to Foot in July 1982, eventually published in June 2006,<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a  title="">[9]</a></sup> gives an indication of his outlook at this time.</p>
<p>In 1983 Blair found that the newly created constituency of <a href="/wiki/Sedgefield_%28UK_Parliament_constituency%29.html" title="Sedgefield (UK Parliament constituency)">Sedgefield</a>, near where he had grown up in <a href="/wiki/Durham.html" title="Durham">Durham</a>, had no Labour candidate. Several sitting MPs displaced by boundary changes were interested in securing selection to fight the seat. He found a branch that had not made a nomination and arranged to visit them. With the crucial support of John Burton, he won their endorsement; at the last minute he was added to the shortlist and won the selection over displaced sitting MP <a href="/wiki/Les_Huckfield.html" title="Les Huckfield">Les Huckfield</a>. Burton later became his agent and one of his most trusted and longest-standing allies.</p>
<p>Blair's election literature in the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election%2C_1983.html" title="United Kingdom general election, 1983">1983 UK general election</a> endorsed the distinctly left-wing policies that the Labour Party advocated in the early 1980s. He called for Britain to leave the <a href="/wiki/European_Union.html" title="European Union">EEC</a>, though he had told his selection conference that he personally favoured continuing membership. He also, more enthusiastically, supported unilateral nuclear disarmament, being a member of the <a href="/wiki/Campaign_for_Nuclear_Disarmament.html" title="Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament">Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament</a> at the time. Sedgefield was a safe Labour seat and Blair was elected as its MP, despite the party's national landslide defeat. Blair was helped on the campaign trail by <a href="/wiki/Soap_opera.html" title="Soap opera">soap</a> actress <a href="/wiki/Patricia_Phoenix.html" title="Patricia Phoenix">Pat Phoenix</a>, his father-in-law's girlfriend.</p>
<p>Blair stated in his maiden speech in the House of Commons on <a href="/wiki/July_6.html" title="July 6">6 July</a> <a href="/wiki/1983.html" title="1983">1983</a>: "I am a socialist not through reading a textbook that has caught my intellectual fancy, nor through unthinking tradition, but because I believe that, at its best, socialism corresponds most closely to an existence that is both rational and moral. It stands for cooperation, not confrontation; for fellowship, not fear. It stands for equality". <sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a  title="">[10]</a></sup> <sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a  title="">[11]</a></sup>. The Labour Party is declared in its constitution to be a <a href="/wiki/Democratic_socialism.html" title="Democratic socialism">democratic socialist</a> party <sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a  title="">[12]</a></sup>, rather than a <a href="/wiki/Social_democratic.html" title="Social democratic">social democratic</a> party - Blair himself organised this declaration of Labour to be a socialist party when he dealt with the change to the party's <a href="/wiki/Clause_IV.html" title="Clause IV">Clause IV</a> in their constitution.</p>

<h2>In opposition</h2>
<p>Once elected, Blair's ascent was rapid, and he received his first shadow-cabinet appointment in 1984 as assistant Treasury spokesman. He demanded an inquiry into the <a href="/wiki/Bank_of_England.html" title="Bank of England">Bank of England</a>'s decision to rescue the collapsed <a  class="new" title="Johnson Matthey Bank">Johnson Matthey Bank</a> in October 1985, and embarrassed the government by finding a <a href="/wiki/European_Economic_Community.html" title="European Economic Community">European Economic Community</a> report critical of British economic policy that had been countersigned by a member of the Conservative government. By this time Blair was aligned with the reforming tendencies in the party, headed by leader <a href="/wiki/Neil_Kinnock.html" title="Neil Kinnock">Neil Kinnock</a>, and was promoted after the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election%2C_1987.html" title="United Kingdom general election, 1987">1987 election</a> to the shadow Trade and Industry team as spokesman on the <a href="/wiki/City_of_London.html" title="City of London">City of London</a>. In 1987, he stood for election to the <a href="/wiki/Shadow_Cabinet.html" title="Shadow Cabinet">Shadow Cabinet</a>, obtaining 77 votes - a good showing for a newcomer.</p>

<p>After the stock market crash of October 1987, Blair raised his profile further when he castigated City traders as "incompetent" and "morally dubious". He also protested against the third-class service for small investors at the <a href="/wiki/London_Stock_Exchange.html" title="London Stock Exchange">London Stock Exchange</a>. In 1988, Blair entered the <a href="/wiki/Shadow_Cabinet.html" title="Shadow Cabinet">Shadow Cabinet</a> as <a href="/wiki/Shadow_Secretary_of_State_for_Energy.html" title="Shadow Secretary of State for Energy">Shadow Secretary of State for Energy</a>, and the following year he became Shadow Employment Secretary. In this post, he realised that the Labour Party's support for the emerging European "Social Charter" policies on employment law meant dropping the party's traditional support for <a href="/wiki/Closed_shop.html" title="Closed shop">closed shop</a> arrangements, whereby employers required all their employees to be members of a trade union. He announced this change in December 1989, outraging the left wing of the Labour Party. As a young and telegenic Shadow Cabinet member, Blair was given prominence by the party's Director of Communications, <a href="/wiki/Peter_Mandelson.html" title="Peter Mandelson">Peter Mandelson</a>. His first major platform speech, at the 1990 Labour Party conference, was a major embarrassment, however: he spoke too fast and lost his place in his notes.</p>
<p>In the run-up to the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election%2C_1992.html" title="United Kingdom general election, 1992">1992 general election</a>, Blair worked to make Labour's image more centrist. He had responsibility for developing the <a href="/wiki/Minimum_wage.html" title="Minimum wage">minimum wage</a> policy that was expected to be strongly attacked by the Conservatives; during the election campaign he had a notable confrontation with the owner of a children's nursery who insisted that the policy would cost jobs.</p>
<p>When Neil Kinnock resigned as party leader after Labour's fourth consecutive electoral defeat, Blair became <a href="/wiki/Shadow_Home_Secretary.html" title="Shadow Home Secretary">Shadow Home Secretary</a> under <a href="/wiki/John_Smith_%28UK_politician%29.html" title="John Smith (UK politician)">John Smith</a>. The Labour Party at this time was widely perceived as weak on crime and Blair worked to change this: he accepted that the prison population might have to rise, and bemoaned the loss of a sense of community, which he was prepared to blame (at least partly) on "1960s liberalism". On the other hand, he spoke in support of equalising the <a href="/wiki/Age_of_consent.html" title="Age of consent">age of consent</a> for <a href="/wiki/Gay_sex.html" title="Gay sex">gay sex</a> at 16, and opposed <a href="/wiki/Capital_punishment.html" title="Capital punishment">capital punishment</a>. He defined his policy, in a phrase coined by <a href="/wiki/Gordon_Brown.html" title="Gordon Brown">Gordon Brown</a>, as "<a href="/wiki/Tough_on_crime.html" title="Tough on crime">Tough on crime</a>, tough on the causes of crime".</p>
<p>John Smith died suddenly in 1994 of a <a href="/wiki/Myocardial_infarction.html" title="Myocardial infarction">heart attack</a>. Blair was elected party leader on <a href="/wiki/July_21.html" title="July 21">21 July</a> <a href="/wiki/1994.html" title="1994">1994</a>, beating <a href="/wiki/John_Prescott.html" title="John Prescott">John Prescott</a> and <a href="/wiki/Margaret_Beckett.html" title="Margaret Beckett">Margaret Beckett</a>. After becoming <a href="/wiki/Leader_of_the_Opposition_%28UK%29.html" title="Leader of the Opposition (UK)">Leader of the Opposition</a>, Blair was, as is customary for the holder of that office, appointed a <a href="/wiki/Privy_Council_of_the_United_Kingdom.html" title="Privy Council of the United Kingdom">Privy Counsellor</a>, which permitted him to be <a href="/wiki/Style_%28manner_of_address%29.html" title="Style (manner of address)">addressed</a> with the style "<a href="/wiki/The_Right_Honourable.html" title="The Right Honourable">The Right Honourable</a>".</p>

<h3>Leader of the Labour Party</h3>
<p>Blair announced at the end of his speech at the 1994 Labour Party conference that he intended to replace <a href="/wiki/Clause_IV.html" title="Clause IV">Clause IV</a> of the party's constitution with a new statement of aims and values. This involved the deletion of the party's stated commitment to 'the common ownership of the means of production and exchange', which was widely interpreted as referring to wholesale <a href="/wiki/Nationalization.html" title="Nationalization">nationalisation</a>. A special conference approved this practically insignificant but highly symbolic change in March 1995.</p>

<p>Blair also revised party policy in a manner that enhanced the image of Labour as competent and modern -- he used the term "New Labour" to distinguish the party from its past. Although the transformation aroused much criticism (its alleged superficiality drawing fire both from political opponents and traditionalists within the "rank and file" of his own party), it was nevertheless successful in changing public perception. At the 1996 Labour Party conference, Blair stated that his three top priorities on coming to office were "education, education and education".</p>
<p>Aided by the unpopularity of <a href="/wiki/John_Major.html" title="John Major">John Major</a>'s Conservative government, which had come to be regarded as economically incompetent and corrupt, and deeply divided over the <a href="/wiki/European_Union.html" title="European Union">European Union</a>, "New Labour" won a landslide victory in the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election%2C_1997.html" title="United Kingdom general election, 1997">1997 general election</a>.</p>

<p>In the early years of his first term, Blair relied for his political advice on a close circle of his staff, among whom his press secretary and official spokesman <a href="/wiki/Alastair_Campbell.html" title="Alastair Campbell">Alastair Campbell</a> was seen as particularly influential. Campbell was permitted to give orders to <a href="/wiki/Civil_servants.html" title="Civil servants">civil servants</a>, who had previously taken instructions only from <a href="/wiki/Political_minister.html" title="Political minister">ministers</a>. Unlike some of his predecessors, Campbell was a political appointee and had not come up through the <a href="/wiki/Civil_Service.html" title="Civil Service">Civil Service</a>. Despite his overtly political role, he was paid from public funds as a civil servant. His appointment was one of a number of New Labour appointments which gave rise to fears that the traditional political neutrality of the civil service was being eroded.</p>
<p>A significant achievement of Blair's first term was the signing, on <a href="/wiki/April_10.html" title="April 10">10 April</a> <a href="/wiki/1998.html" title="1998">1998</a>, of the <a href="/wiki/Belfast_Agreement.html" title="Belfast Agreement">Belfast Agreement</a>, generally known as the Good Friday Agreement. Negotiations aimed at bringing peace to Northern Ireland had begun under the previous Prime Minister, <a href="/wiki/John_Major.html" title="John Major">John Major</a>, but had collapsed after the end of the first <a href="/wiki/TUAS.html" title="TUAS">IRA ceasefire</a> in the mid-1990s. In the Good Friday Agreement, most Northern Irish political parties, together with the British and Irish Governments, agreed upon an "exclusively peaceful and democratic" framework for the governance of Northern Ireland and a new set of political institutions for the province.</p>
<p>Blair's first term saw an extensive programme of constitutional change. A <a href="/wiki/Human_Rights_Act_1998.html" title="Human Rights Act 1998">Human Rights Act</a> was introduced in 1998; a <a href="/wiki/Scottish_Parliament.html" title="Scottish Parliament">Scottish Parliament</a> and a <a href="/wiki/Welsh_Assembly.html" title="Welsh Assembly">Welsh Assembly</a> were set up; most hereditary <a href="/wiki/Peerage.html" title="Peerage">peers</a> were removed from the <a href="/wiki/House_of_Lords.html" title="House of Lords">House of Lords</a> in 1999; the <a href="/wiki/Greater_London_Authority.html" title="Greater London Authority">Greater London Authority</a> and the post of <a href="/wiki/Mayor_of_London.html" title="Mayor of London">Mayor of London</a> were established in 2000; and the <a href="/wiki/Freedom_of_Information_Act_2000.html" title="Freedom of Information Act 2000">Freedom of Information Act</a> was passed later in the same year, with its provisions coming into effect over the following decade. This last Act disappointed campaigners, whose hopes had been raised by a 1998 <a href="/wiki/White_Paper.html" title="White Paper">White Paper</a> which had promised more robust legislation. No significant progress has been made in reforming the House of Lords since 1999: whether the reformed chamber should be fully elected, fully appointed, or part-elected and part-appointed remains a disputed question. An attempt to resolve the question in 2003 foundered after a series of inconclusive votes in the House of Commons, with Blair being blamed by some for bringing about the deadlock.</p>
<p>Blair has supported <a href="/wiki/Gay_rights.html" title="Gay rights">gay rights</a> more than any previous British Prime Minister. During his first term, the age of consent was equalized at 16 and the ban on gays in the armed forces was lifted. Subsequently, in 2005, a Civil Partnership Act came into effect, allowing gay couples to form legally recognised partnerships.</p>

<p>In 1999, Blair planned and presided over the declaration of the <a href="/wiki/Kosovo_War.html" title="Kosovo War">Kosovo War</a>. While in opposition, the Labour Party had criticised the Conservatives for their perceived weakness during the <a href="/wiki/Bosnia_and_Herzegovina.html" title="Bosnia and Herzegovina">Bosnian</a> war, and Blair was among those urging a strong line by <a href="/wiki/NATO.html" title="NATO">NATO</a> against <a href="/wiki/Slobodan_Milo%C5%A1evi%C4%87.html" title="Slobodan Milošević">Slobodan Milošević</a>.

One month into the war, on <a href="/wiki/April_22.html" title="April 22">22 April</a> <a href="/wiki/1999.html" title="1999">1999</a>, Blair made a speech in Chicago setting out his "Doctrine of the International Community".<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a  title="">[13]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>In the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election%2C_2001.html" title="United Kingdom general election, 2001">2001 general election</a> campaign, Blair emphasised the theme of improving public services, notably the <a href="/wiki/National_Health_Service.html" title="National Health Service">National Health Service</a> and the State education system. The Conservatives concentrated on opposing British membership of <a href="/wiki/Economic_and_Monetary_Union_of_the_European_Union.html" title="Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union">the Euro</a>, which did little to win over <a href="/wiki/Floating_voter.html" title="Floating voter">floating voters</a>.

<p>Following the <a href="/wiki/September_11%2C_2001_attacks.html" title="September 11, 2001 attacks">11 September 2001</a> attacks on New York and Washington, Blair was very quick to align the UK with the United States, engaging in a round of <a href="/wiki/Shuttle_diplomacy.html" title="Shuttle diplomacy">shuttle diplomacy</a> to help form and maintain an international coalition prior to the <a href="/wiki/2001_Attack_on_Afghanistan.html" title="2001 Attack on Afghanistan">2001 war against Afghanistan</a>.

He soon became the face of international support for the war, often clashing with <a href="/wiki/President_of_France.html" title="President of France">French President</a> <a href="/wiki/Jacques_Chirac.html" title="Jacques Chirac">Jacques Chirac</a>, who became the face of international opposition. Regarded by many as a more persuasive speaker than Bush, Blair gave many speeches arguing for the overthrow of Saddam Hussein in the days leading up to the invasion.</p>
<p>Blair's case for war was based on Iraq's alleged possession of <a href="/wiki/Weapons_of_mass_destruction.html" title="Weapons of mass destruction">weapons of mass destruction</a> and consequent violation of UN resolutions. He was wary of making direct appeals for <a href="/wiki/Regime_change.html" title="Regime change">regime change</a>, since international law does not recognize this as a ground for war. A <a href="/wiki/Downing_Street_memo.html" title="Downing Street memo">memorandum</a> from a July 2002 meeting that was leaked in April 2005 showed that Blair believed that the British public would support regime change in the right political context; the document, however, stated that legal grounds for such action were weak. On <a href="/wiki/September_24.html" title="September 24">24 September</a> <a href="/wiki/2002.html" title="2002">2002</a> the Government published a <a href="/wiki/September_Dossier.html" title="September Dossier">dossier</a> based on the intelligence agencies' assessments of <a href="/wiki/Iraqi_production_and_use_of_weapons_of_mass_destruction.html" title="Iraqi production and use of weapons of mass destruction">Iraq's weapons of mass destruction</a>. Among the items in the dossier was a recently received intelligence report that "the Iraqi military are able to deploy chemical or biological weapons within 45 minutes of an order to do so". A further briefing paper on Iraq's alleged WMDs was issued to journalists in February 2003. This document was discovered to have taken a large part of its text without attribution from a PhD thesis available on the internet. Where the thesis hypothesized about possible WMDs, the Downing Street version presented the ideas as fact. The document subsequently became known as the "<a href="/wiki/Dodgy_Dossier.html" title="Dodgy Dossier">Dodgy Dossier</a>".</p>
<p>Forty-six thousand British troops, one-third of the total strength of the <a href="/wiki/British_Army.html" title="British Army">British Army</a> (land forces), were deployed to assist with the invasion of Iraq. When, after the war, it was established that Iraq had not possessed any WMDs, the two dossiers, together with Blair's other pre-war statements, became an issue of considerable controversy. Many Labour Party members, including a number who had supported the war, were among the critics. Successive independent inquiries (including those by the Foreign Affairs <a href="/wiki/Select_Committee.html" title="Select Committee">Select Committee</a> of the <a href="/wiki/British_House_of_Commons.html" title="British House of Commons">House of Commons</a>, the senior judge <a href="/wiki/Hutton_Inquiry.html" title="Hutton Inquiry">Lord Hutton</a>, and the former senior civil servant <a href="/wiki/Butler_Review.html" title="Butler Review">Lord Butler of Brockwell</a>) have found that Blair honestly stated what he believed to be true at the time, though Lord Butler's report did imply that the Government's presentation of the intelligence evidence had been subject to some degree of exaggeration. These findings have not prevented frequent accusations that Blair was deliberately deceitful, and, during the 2005 election campaign, Conservative leader Michael Howard made political capital out of the issue.</p>

<p>Several anti-war pressure groups want to try Blair for war crimes in Iraq at the <a href="/wiki/International_Criminal_Court.html" title="International Criminal Court">International Criminal Court</a>. The <a href="/wiki/Secretary_General_of_the_United_Nations.html" title="Secretary General of the United Nations">Secretary General of the United Nations</a>, <a href="/wiki/Kofi_Annan.html" title="Kofi Annan">Kofi Annan</a>, stated in September 2004 that the invasion was "illegal", but did not state the legal basis for this assertion. Prior to the war, the UK Attorney General <a href="/wiki/Lord_Goldsmith.html" title="Lord Goldsmith">Lord Goldsmith</a>, who acts as the Government's legal adviser, had advised Blair that the war was legal.</p>
<p>British armed forces were active in southern Iraq to stabilise the country in the run-up to the Iraqi elections of January 2005. In October 2004, the UK government agreed to a request from US forces to send a battalion of the <a href="/wiki/Black_Watch.html" title="Black Watch">Black Watch</a> regiment to the American sector in order to free up US troops for an assault on <a href="/wiki/Fallujah.html" title="Fallujah">Fallujah</a>. The subsequent deployment of the Black Watch was criticised by some in Britain on the grounds that its alleged ultimate purpose was to assist George Bush's re-election in the 2004 US presidential election. At present, British forces remain in Iraq. After the presidential election, Blair tried to use his relationship with President Bush to persuade the US to devote efforts to resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</p>

<h3>Domestic politics</h3>
<p>After fighting the 2001 election on the theme of improving public services, Blair's government continued to raise taxes in 2002 (described by the Conservatives as "<a href="/wiki/Stealth_tax.html" title="Stealth tax">stealth taxes</a>") in order to increase spending on education and health. Blair insisted that the increased funding must be matched by <a href="/wiki/Quasi-market.html" title="Quasi-market">internal reforms</a>. The government introduced the <a href="/wiki/Foundation_Hospitals.html" title="Foundation Hospitals">Foundation Hospitals</a> scheme to allow NHS hospitals financial autonomy, although the eventual shape of the proposals, after an internal struggle with <a href="/wiki/Gordon_Brown.html" title="Gordon Brown">Gordon Brown</a>, allowed for somewhat less freedom than Blair had wished. Many healthcare trusts established under the foundation hospitals scheme are now in severe financial difficulties, having spent large proportions of their funding increases on pay rises for staff and on expensive drugs. As a result, with supply increasing less quickly than demand, benefits from the NHS have not increased to the same degree, and the NHS is in deficit for 2005-6 to the tune of around £800 million.</p>
<p>The peace process in Northern Ireland hit a series of problems. In October 2002, the Northern Ireland Assembly established under the Good Friday Agreement was suspended. Attempts to persuade the <a href="/wiki/Provisional_Irish_Republican_Army.html" title="Provisional Irish Republican Army">IRA</a> to decommission its weapons were unsuccessful, and, in the second set of elections to the Assembly in November 2003, the staunchly unionist <a href="/wiki/Democratic_Unionist_Party.html" title="Democratic Unionist Party">Democratic Unionist Party</a> replaced the more moderate <a href="/wiki/Ulster_Unionist_Party.html" title="Ulster Unionist Party">Ulster Unionist Party</a> as Northern Ireland's largest unionist party, making a return to devolved government more difficult. At the same time, <a href="/wiki/Sinn_F%C3%A9in.html" title="Sinn Féin">Sinn Féin</a> replaced the more moderate <a href="/wiki/Social_Democratic_and_Labour_Party.html" title="Social Democratic and Labour Party">SDLP</a> as the province's largest nationalist party.</p>
<p>In its first term, the government had introduced an annual fixed tuition fee of around £1,000 for higher education students (rejecting requests from <a href="/wiki/University.html" title="University">universities</a> to be allowed to vary the fee), with reductions and exemptions for poor students. At the same time, the remaining student maintenance grant had been replaced with a low-interest loan, which was to be repaid once the student was earning over a certain threshold. In 2003, Blair controversially introduced legislation permitting universities to charge variable fees of up to £3,000 per year. At the same time, the repayment of student loans was delayed until the graduate's income was much higher, and grants were reintroduced for some students from poorer backgrounds. It was claimed that the increase in university fees violated a promise in Labour's 2001 election manifesto, though this claim is arguably unsustainable if the relevant promise is interpreted strictly and literally. At its <a href="/wiki/Second_reading.html" title="Second reading">second reading</a> in the House of Commons in January 2004, the <a href="/wiki/Higher_Education_Act_2004.html" title="Higher Education Act 2004">Higher Education Bill</a> which contained the changes was passed with a majority of only five, due to a large-scale backbench Labour rebellion. A defeat had been averted only by a last-minute change of heart by a small number of Gordon Brown's backbench allies.</p>

<p>On <a href="/wiki/August_1.html" title="August 1">1 August</a> <a href="/wiki/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a> Blair became the longest continuously serving Labour Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, surpassing <a href="/wiki/Harold_Wilson.html" title="Harold Wilson">Harold Wilson</a>'s 1964-1970 term. By this time, however, the Government had been overtaken by the crisis over the suicide of Dr. <a href="/wiki/David_Kelly.html" title="David Kelly">David Kelly</a>, and there were no celebrations. Dr. Kelly was a Government scientist who had spoken to a BBC journalist about a published <a href="/wiki/September_Dossier.html" title="September Dossier">intelligence dossier</a> which had been used to justify the Iraq War, leading to a major public conflict between the BBC and the Government. After the news of Dr Kelly's suicide broke, Lord Falconer, the Lord Chancellor, set up an inquiry into the circumstances surrounding his death, conducted by the senior <a href="/wiki/Law_Lord.html" title="Law Lord">Law Lord</a>, <a href="/wiki/Brian_Hutton%2C_Baron_Hutton.html" title="Brian Hutton, Baron Hutton">Lord Hutton</a>. The <a href="/wiki/Hutton_Inquiry.html" title="Hutton Inquiry">Hutton Inquiry</a> reported on <a href="/wiki/August_2.html" title="August 2">2 August</a>, and, despite widespread expectations that Lord Hutton's report would criticise Blair and his government, Hutton cleared the Government of deliberately inserting false intelligence into the <a href="/wiki/September_Dossier.html" title="September Dossier">September Dossier</a>, while criticising the <a href="/wiki/BBC.html" title="BBC">BBC</a> editorial process which had allowed unfounded allegations to be broadcast. Evidence to the inquiry, however, had raised questions over the use of intelligence in the run up to the war, and the report did not satisfy opponents of Blair and of the war. Lord Hutton was <a href="/wiki/Hutton_Inquiry#Media_reaction_to_the_report.html" title="Hutton Inquiry">criticised</a> for strictly interpreting his remit, and, after a similar decision by President Bush, Blair set up another inquiry - the <a href="/wiki/Butler_Review.html" title="Butler Review">Butler Review</a> - into the accuracy and presentation of the intelligence relating to Iraq's alleged weapons of mass destruction. Opponents of the war, especially the <a href="/wiki/Liberal_Democrats_%28UK%29.html" title="Liberal Democrats (UK)">Liberal Democrats</a>, refused to participate in this inquiry, since it did not meet their demands for a full public inquiry into whether the war was justified.</p>
<p>Even after the Butler Review, the political fallout from the Iraq War continued to dog Blair's premiership. On <a href="/wiki/August_25.html" title="August 25">25 August</a> <a href="/wiki/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a> <a href="/wiki/Plaid_Cymru.html" title="Plaid Cymru">Plaid Cymru</a> MP <a href="/wiki/Adam_Price.html" title="Adam Price">Adam Price</a> announced that he would attempt to <a href="/wiki/Impeachment.html" title="Impeachment">impeach</a> Blair, <sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a  title="">[16]</a></sup> invoking a Parliamentary procedure that has lain dormant for 150 years but has never been abolished. In principle, the British House of Commons has the power to indict Tony Blair before the House of Lords, who would in turn have the power to pass whatever sentence it considered appropriate upon him, without reference to the ordinary criminal courts. This move was supported by Plaid Cymru and the <a href="/wiki/Scottish_National_Party.html" title="Scottish National Party">SNP</a>, as well as by <a href="/wiki/RESPECT_The_Unity_Coalition.html" title="RESPECT The Unity Coalition">RESPECT</a>'s <a href="/wiki/George_Galloway.html" title="George Galloway">George Galloway</a> and Independent MP <a href="/wiki/Richard_Taylor_%28UK_politician%29.html" title="Richard Taylor (UK politician)">Richard Taylor</a>. Ten Conservative MPs signed the relevant motion, as did two <a href="/wiki/Liberal_Democrats_%28UK%29.html" title="Liberal Democrats (UK)">Liberal Democrats</a>, making a total of 23 MPs. The campaign attracted the support of writers <a href="/wiki/Iain_Banks.html" title="Iain Banks">Iain Banks</a> and <a href="/wiki/Frederick_Forsyth.html" title="Frederick Forsyth">Frederick Forsyth</a>, and actor <a href="/wiki/Corin_Redgrave.html" title="Corin Redgrave">Corin Redgrave</a>. The case for Blair's impeachment was outlined by Adam Price in a report entitled "A case to answer" <sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a  title="">[17]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>In April 2004, Blair announced that a <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom_referendum_on_the_Treaty_establishing_a_constitution_for_Europe.html" title="United Kingdom referendum on the Treaty establishing a constitution for Europe">referendum</a> would be held on the ratification of the <a href="/wiki/EU_Constitution.html" title="EU Constitution">EU Constitution</a>. This represented a significant development in British politics: only one nationwide referendum had previously been held (in 1975, on <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom_referendum%2C_1975.html" title="United Kingdom referendum, 1975">whether the UK should remain in the EEC</a>), though a referendum had been promised if the Government decided to join the Euro, and referenda had been held on devolved structures of government in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. It was a dramatic change of policy for Blair, who had previously dismissed calls for a referendum unless the constitution fundamentally altered the UK's relationship with the EU. <a href="/wiki/Michael_Howard.html" title="Michael Howard">Michael Howard</a> seized upon this "EU-turn", reminding Blair of his declaration to the 2003 Labour Party conference that "I can only go one way. I haven't got a reverse gear". The referendum was expected to be held in early 2006; however, after the French and Dutch rejections of the constitution, the Blair government announced that it was suspending plans for a referendum for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>During his second term, Blair was increasingly the target for protests. His speech to the 2004 Labour Party conference, for example, was interrupted both by a protester against the Iraq War and by a group that opposed the government's decision to allow the House of Commons to ban <a href="/wiki/Fox_hunting.html" title="Fox hunting">fox hunting</a>.</p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/September_15.html" title="September 15">15 September</a> <a href="/wiki/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a> Blair delivered a speech on the environment and the 'urgent issue' of <a href="/wiki/Climate_change.html" title="Climate change">climate change</a>. In unusually direct language he concluded that <i>If what the science tells us about climate change is correct, then unabated it will result in catastrophic consequences for our world... The science, almost certainly, is correct.</i> The action he proposed to take appeared to be based on business and investment rather than legislative or tax-based attempts to reduce <a href="/wiki/Carbon_dioxide.html" title="Carbon dioxide">CO<sub>2</sub></a> emissions: <i>...it is possible to combine reducing emissions with economic growth... investment in science and technology and in the businesses associated with it....</i> <sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a  title="">[18]</a></sup>.</p>

Downing Street aides later suggested that the palpitations had been brought on by Blair drinking lots of strong <a href="/wiki/Coffee.html" title="Coffee">coffee</a> at an <a href="/wiki/European_Union.html" title="European Union">EU</a> summit and then working out vigorously in the gym. However, former <a href="/wiki/Armed_Forces.html" title="Armed Forces">Armed Forces</a> minister <a href="/wiki/Lewis_Moonie.html" title="Lewis Moonie">Lewis Moonie</a>, a doctor, said that the treatment was more serious than <a href="/wiki/10_Downing_Street.html" title="10 Downing Street">Number 10</a> had admitted: "Anaesthetising somebody and giving their heart electric shocks is not something you just do in the routine run of medical practice", he claimed.</p>
<p>Family problems in the spring of 2004 fuelled speculation that Blair was on the brink of stepping down. In September 2004, in off-the-cuff remarks during an interview with ITV news, <a href="/wiki/Melvyn_Bragg.html" title="Melvyn Bragg">Lord Bragg</a> said that Blair was "under colossal strain" over "considerations of his family" and that Blair had thought "things over very carefully." This led to a surge in speculation that Blair would resign. Although details of the family problem were known by the press, no paper would report them because to do so "breaches the bounds of privacy and media responsibility" as they did not relate to Mr Blair himself <sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a  title="">[19]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Blair underwent a <a href="/wiki/Catheter_ablation.html" title="Catheter ablation">catheter ablation</a> to correct his irregular heartbeat on <a href="/wiki/October_1.html" title="October 1">1 October</a> <a href="/wiki/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>, having announced the procedure the day before in a series of interviews in which he also declared that he would seek a third term but not a fourth.<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a  title="">[20]</a></sup> The planned procedure was carried out at <a href="/wiki/London.html" title="London">London</a>'s <a href="/wiki/Hammersmith.html" title="Hammersmith">Hammersmith</a> hospital.

<p>Chirac held several meetings with Schröder and the pair pressed for the UK to give up its <a href="/wiki/UK_rebate.html" title="UK rebate">rebate</a>, famously won by Margaret Thatcher in 1984.

<p>On Thursday <a href="/wiki/July_7.html" title="July 7">7 July</a> <a href="/wiki/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>, <a href="/wiki/7_July_2005_London_bombings.html" title="7 July 2005 London bombings">a series of four bomb explosions</a> struck London's public transport system during the morning rush-hour. All four incidents were <a href="/wiki/Suicide_bombings.html" title="Suicide bombings">suicide bombings</a>. Fifty-six people were killed and 700 injured. The incident was the deadliest single act of terrorism in the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom.html" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> since 270 died in the 1988 bombing of <a href="/wiki/Pan_Am_Flight_103.html" title="Pan Am Flight 103">Pan Am Flight 103</a> over <a href="/wiki/Lockerbie%2C_Scotland.html" title="Lockerbie, Scotland">Lockerbie, Scotland</a>, and it was the deadliest bombing in London since <a href="/wiki/World_War_II.html" title="World War II">World War II</a>.</p>
<p>Blair made <a  class="extiw" title="wikisource:Comments_on_the_2005_London_transport_explosions">a statement</a> about the day's bombings, saying that he believed it was "reasonably clear" that it was an act of terror, and that he hoped the people of Britain could demonstrate that their will to overcome the events is greater than the terrorists' wish to cause destruction. He also said that his determination to "defend" the British way of life outweighed "extremist determination" to destroy it. On <a href="/wiki/July_13.html" title="July 13">13 July</a> <a href="/wiki/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>, he told that international cooperation would be needed to "pull up this evil ideology by its roots".<sup id="_ref-guardian-05-07-14_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[27]</a></sup></p>

Four controlled explosions, of devices considerably less advanced than those of the previous attacks, were carried out at <a href="/wiki/Shepherd%27s_Bush_tube_station_%28Hammersmith_and_City_Line%29.html" title="Shepherd's Bush tube station (Hammersmith and City Line)">Shepherd's Bush</a>, <a href="/wiki/Warren_Street_tube_station.html" title="Warren Street tube station">Warren Street</a> and <a href="/wiki/Oval_tube_station.html" title="Oval tube station">Oval</a> underground stations, and on a bus in <a href="/wiki/Shoreditch.html" title="Shoreditch">Shoreditch</a>. Even though the attacks on the 21st were less severe than those on the 7th, Blair was reported to have said that the bombings in London today were intended "to scare people and to frighten them, to make them anxious and worried". He went on to say how the "police have done their very best, and the security services too, in the situation, and I think we have just got to react calmly and continue with our business as much as possible normal".</p>
<p>Concerns about terror attacks led to 10 Downing Street requesting media organizations not to identify the location of Blair's 2005 summer holiday. After Blair attended a public function it was acknowledged that the holiday was in <a href="/wiki/Barbados.html" title="Barbados">Barbados</a>, as a guest of the singer <a href="/wiki/Cliff_Richard.html" title="Cliff Richard">Cliff Richard</a> with whom Blair has stayed before.</p>
<p>A <i>Guardian</i>/ICM poll conducted after the first wave of attacks found that 64% of the British population believed that Blair's decision to wage war in Iraq had led indirectly to the terrorist attacks on London. <sup id="_ref-24" class="reference"><a  title="">[28]</a></sup> The public did however indicate approval of Blair's handling of the attacks, with his approval rating moving into positive territory for the first time in five years. <sup id="_ref-25" class="reference"><a  title="">[29]</a></sup>. In December 2005, the Prime Minister was presented with the "Statesman of the Decade" award by the EastWest Institute, a trans-Atlantic think tank that organizes an annual Security Conference in Brussels<sup id="_ref-26" class="reference"><a  title="">[30]</a></sup>.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Terrorism_Bill_2005.html" title="Terrorism Bill 2005">Proposed laws</a> to cope with the threat of terrorism proved extremely controversial; an amendment to require that glorifying terrorism be deliberate in order to be an offence was rejected in the House of Commons by just three votes (a result initially announced as a one-vote margin, due to a miscount). The proposal to allow terrorist suspects to be held for questioning for up to 90 days was defeated on <a href="/wiki/November_9.html" title="November 9">9 November</a> by a margin of 31 <sup id="_ref-27" class="reference"><a  title="">[31]</a></sup> with 49 Labour MPs voting against the government.

<h3>Education reforms 2006</h3>
<p>The introduction of further reforms to the education system, which restricted the involvement of local education authorities in opening new schools, proved controversial. Labour backbenchers opposed to the proposals produced a rival manifesto, and the Bill to introduce the changes was delayed while the government negotiated with them. The Conservative Party declared its support for the reforms, making it certain that they would be passed but increasing the likelihood that Labour MPs would vote against. On <a href="/wiki/March_15.html" title="March 15">15 March</a> <a href="/wiki/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> the Education and Inspections Bill passed its second reading with 52 Labour MPs voting against; had the Conservative Party voted against instead of in favour, it would have been defeated.</p>

<h3>Local elections on 4 May 2006 and cabinet reshuffle</h3>
<p>The local elections in England on <a href="/wiki/May_4.html" title="May 4">4 May</a> <a href="/wiki/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> dealt a blow to Blair, with the loss of 317 seats and 18 councils. This result was thought to be partly continued fallout from public dissatisfaction over the decision to invade Iraq, and partly due to a scandal concerning the Home Office's mishandling of foreign criminals' deportation. At the same time, an affair of the Deputy Prime Minister <a href="/wiki/John_Prescott.html" title="John Prescott">John Prescott</a> with his diary secretary had been made public. Further, some Primary Care and Hospital Trust sustained significant deficits and had to release staff, which called into question the position of Health Secretary <a href="/wiki/Patricia_Hewitt.html" title="Patricia Hewitt">Patricia Hewitt</a>. On <a href="/wiki/May_5.html" title="May 5">5 May</a>, Blair reshuffled his Cabinet. Most significantly, Charles Clarke and Foreign Secretary <a href="/wiki/Jack_Straw_%28politician%29.html" title="Jack Straw (politician)">Jack Straw</a> were relieved of their duties and many other positions were reassigned. Many commentators saw this as a panic reaction designed to ward off calls for Blair to step down.</p>

<p>After Labour's 2004 conference, Blair announced in a BBC interview <sup id="_ref-29" class="reference"><a  title="">[33]</a></sup> that he would serve a "full third term" but would not fight a fourth general election. No term limits exist in British politics, and such an announcement was historically unprecedented.</p>
<p>In the months following the 2005 election, there was frequent speculation over the date of Blair's departure. He was widely expected at Westminster to retire after the proposed UK referendum on the <a href="/wiki/European_Union_Constitution.html" title="European Union Constitution">European Union Constitution</a>, but the constitution's demise eliminated this possibility. The July 2005 terror attacks also lessened the likelihood of an early departure. Speculation as to the likely time of Blair's departure increased in May 2006 following Labour's poor results in English local elections. Such speculation is recurrent in the press and in political circles when any mishap befalls the government. Blair has said he will give "ample time" for his successor to establish himself before the next general election, which is likely to be held in 2009 or 2010. His successor is widely expected to be <a href="/wiki/Gordon_Brown.html" title="Gordon Brown">Gordon Brown</a>, the current <a href="/wiki/Chancellor_of_the_Exchequer.html" title="Chancellor of the Exchequer">Chancellor of the Exchequer</a>.

<p>Blair has encouraged reforms to Parliamentary procedures. One of his first acts as Prime Minister was to replace the two weekly 15-minute sessions of <a href="/wiki/Prime_Minister%27s_Questions.html" title="Prime Minister's Questions">Prime Minister's Questions</a>, held on a Tuesday and Thursday, with a single 30-minute session on a Wednesday. This reform was said to have led to greater efficiency, but critics have noted that it is easier to prepare for one long set of questions than for two shorter sessions. In addition to PMQs, Blair has held monthly press conferences, at which he fields questions in a less formal or confrontational manner than in the Commons.<sup id="_ref-37" class="reference"><a  title="">[42]</a></sup> <sup id="_ref-38" class="reference"><a  title="">[43]</a></sup></p>
<p>Other procedural reforms supported by Blair include changes to the rules concerning the times when Parliament sits. These latter changes are said to allow Parliament to operate in a more business-like manner, but they have also arguably reduced MPs' ability to scrutinise legislation effectively.</p>

<h2>Blair in the media</h2>
<p>While evaluations of Blair's skills as a parliamentarian differ, he is acknowledged to be a highly skillful media performer in other contexts, appearing modern, charismatic, informal and articulate. His best known television appearance was perhaps his tribute to <a href="/wiki/Diana%2C_Princess_of_Wales.html" title="Diana, Princess of Wales">Diana, Princess of Wales</a> on the morning of her death in August 1997, in which he famously described the late princess as "the people's princess".</p>
<p>After taking office in 1997, Blair gave particular prominence to his press secretary, who became known as the <a href="/wiki/Prime_Minister%27s_Official_Spokesman.html" title="Prime Minister's Official Spokesman">Prime Minister's Official Spokesman</a> (the two roles have since been separated). Blair's first PMOS was <a href="/wiki/Alastair_Campbell.html" title="Alastair Campbell">Alastair Campbell</a>, who served in that role from May 1997 to <a href="/wiki/June_8.html" title="June 8">8 June</a> <a href="/wiki/2001.html" title="2001">2001</a>, after which he served as the Prime Minister's Director of Communications and Strategy until his resignation on <a href="/wiki/August_29.html" title="August 29">29 August</a> <a href="/wiki/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a>, in the aftermath of the <a href="/wiki/Hutton_Inquiry.html" title="Hutton Inquiry">Hutton Inquiry</a>. Campbell acquired a reputation as a sinister and machiavellian figure, and both Blair and Campbell have frequently been criticised for their allegedly excessive use of "spin" and news management techniques: see below under <i>Criticism</i>.</p>

<p><a name="Blair_and_Brown" id="Blair_and_Brown"></a></p>
<h2>Blair and Brown</h2>
<p>After the death of John Smith in 1994, both Blair and his fellow modernizer Gordon Brown were viewed as possible candidates for the leadership of the Labour Party. They had always agreed that they would not stand against each other, and Brown had previously been considered to be the more senior of the two men; he understood this to mean that Blair would give way to him. It soon became apparent, however, that Blair had greater public support.<sup id="_ref-39" class="reference"><a  title="">[44]</a></sup> At the <a href="/wiki/Granita_%28restaurant%29.html" title="Granita (restaurant)">Granita</a> restaurant in <a href="/wiki/Islington.html" title="Islington">Islington</a> on <a href="/wiki/May_31.html" title="May 31">31 May</a>, Brown agreed with Blair that he would not contest the leadership election. He understood Blair to have undertaken in return to step down as party leader after a specified period (after 8 years, according to some reports), but Blair has always denied striking any such deal with him. It may be that both men placed honestly differing interpretations on the same conversation.</p>
<p>It has also been alleged that Blair, while in office as Prime Minister, gave Brown further indications and even promises that he would step down in Brown's favour at specified times. Whatever the truth of these reports (which may perhaps again be based on misinterpretations of ambiguous words), Blair's consistent refusal to leave office (so far) has led to relations between the two men becoming irretrievably embittered. At certain times, Deputy Prime Minister <a href="/wiki/John_Prescott.html" title="John Prescott">John Prescott</a> has reportedly acted as their "marriage guidance counsellor".</p>
<p>Another aspect of the political relationship between Blair and Brown is the exceptional freedom given by Blair from the start of his time in office to his Chancellor in the area of economic policy. Downing Street insiders have subsequently reported that Blair grew to regret granting Brown this freedom, since he has been excluded from important fiscal decisions as a result.</p>

<h2>Blair's religious faith</h2>
<p>Blair has rarely discussed his religious faith in public, but he is often identified as an <a href="/wiki/Anglo-Catholic.html" title="Anglo-Catholic">Anglo-Catholic</a> — that is, a member of the <a href="/wiki/High_church.html" title="High church">high church</a> wing of the <a href="/wiki/Church_of_England.html" title="Church of England">Church of England</a>, sympathetic to many <a href="/wiki/Roman_Catholic_Church.html" title="Roman Catholic Church">Roman Catholic</a> beliefs and practices. His wife, <a href="/wiki/Cherie_Blair.html" title="Cherie Blair">Cherie Booth</a>, is a practising Roman Catholic, and he has attended Catholic Masses at Westminster Cathedral, while on holiday in Italy, and with his family at his current home in Number 10 Downing Street. At one point, he was reprimanded by Cardinal <a href="/wiki/Basil_Hume.html" title="Basil Hume">Basil Hume</a> for receiving <a href="/wiki/Holy_Communion.html" title="Holy Communion">Holy Communion</a> at Mass despite not being a Roman Catholic, a contravention of Catholic doctrine.</p>
<p>In an interview with <a href="/wiki/Michael_Parkinson.html" title="Michael Parkinson">Michael Parkinson</a> broadcast on <a href="/wiki/ITV1.html" title="ITV1">ITV1</a> on <a href="/wiki/March_4.html" title="March 4">4 March</a> <a href="/wiki/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>, Blair referred to the role of his Christian faith in his decision to go to war in Iraq, stating that he had <a href="/wiki/Prayer.html" title="Prayer">prayed</a> about the issue, and saying that God would judge him for his decision <sup id="_ref-40" class="reference"><a  title="">[45]</a></sup>: <i>"I think if you have faith about these things, you realise that judgement is made by other people … and if you believe in God, it's made by God as well."</i> His comments were later interpreted by some of his critics as indicating that he believed that God had endorsed his decision to participate in the invasion.</p>

<h2>Political overview</h2>
<p>Which part of the political spectrum Tony Blair occupies is disputed. Many Britons would place him in the centre ground. Many others, including many of his left-wing critics, would place him on the right of centre. Some others again, including some old-style Conservatives, regard him as a left-winger. Blair rarely applies such labels to himself, though he promised, in advance of the 1997 election, that New Labour would govern "from the radical centre", and he is on record as describing himself as a "<a href="/wiki/Social_democracy.html" title="Social democracy">social democrat</a>".</p>
<p>An overview of Blair's policies gives an idea of the difficulty of defining him politically. He has raised taxes; implemented redistributive policies (to a modest extent); introduced a minimum wage and some new employment rights (while leaving Margaret Thatcher's trade union legislation wholly unchanged); introduced important constitutional reforms (which remain incomplete and controversial); promoted new rights for gay people in the Civil Partnerships Act; and signed treaties integrating Britain more closely with the EU (opposed by the Conservatives). On the other hand, he has firmly supported George W. Bush's foreign policy (while reportedly attempting to act as a restraining influence on him); introduced substantial market-based reforms in the education and health sectors (though not to the extent advocated by the Conservatives); introduced student tuition fees (with safeguards for poor students); sought to reduce (certain categories of) welfare payments; and introduced tough anti-terrorism and identity card legislation (with claimed public support).</p>

<p>The criticism of Tony Blair includes accusations of dishonesty and <a href="/wiki/Authoritarianism.html" title="Authoritarianism">authoritarianism</a> as well as suspicions about his alliance with U.S. President <a href="/wiki/George_W._Bush.html" title="George W. Bush">George W. Bush</a>. While <a href="/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom.html" title="Prime Minister of the United Kingdom">Prime Minister of the United Kingdom</a>'s inevitably receive some measure of public criticism, Tony Blair has endured particularly severe public censure since the participation of the British armed forces in the March 2003 invasion of Iraq.</p>
<p>A widely-levelled criticism of Blair and his subordinates is that they make use of spin to such an extent that his government has fundamentally lost credibility with the British public. It is also claimed that the Government has on occasions crossed the line between selective presentation of information and deliberate misleading.</p>
<p>Blair has consistently supported the police and sought to increase police powers. While this policy initially attracted widespread support, the government's legislative response to the threat of militant Islamism has been regarded by some as <a href="/wiki/Authoritarianism.html" title="Authoritarianism">authoritarian</a>.<sup title="The text in the vicinity of this tag needs citation." class="noprint">[<a  title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><i>citation&#160;needed</i></a>]</sup></p>

<p>Along with enjoying a close relationship with <a href="/wiki/Bill_Clinton.html" title="Bill Clinton">Bill Clinton</a> during the latter's time in office, Blair has formed a strong political alliance with President <a href="/wiki/George_W._Bush.html" title="George W. Bush">George W. Bush</a> of the <a href="/wiki/United_States_of_America.html" title="United States of America">United States of America</a>, particularly in the area of foreign policy: at one point, <a href="/wiki/Nelson_Mandela.html" title="Nelson Mandela">Nelson Mandela</a> described Blair as "the US foreign minister".<sup id="_ref-41" class="reference"><a  title="">[46]</a></sup> For his part, President <a href="/wiki/George_W._Bush.html" title="George W. Bush">Bush</a> has lauded Blair and the UK many times: in his post-September 11 speech, for example, he stated that "America has no truer friend than Great Britain".<sup id="_ref-42" class="reference"><a  title="">[47]</a></sup> The alliance between Bush and Blair has seriously damaged Blair's standing in the eyes of many British people, particularly those on the traditional Left.<sup title="The text in the vicinity of this tag needs citation." class="noprint">[<a  title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><i>citation&#160;needed</i></a>]</sup></p>
<p>Blair is perceived by many as an excessively autocratic leader: it is claimed that he pays insufficient attention both to the views of his own Cabinet colleagues and to those of the <a href="/wiki/British_House_of_Commons.html" title="British House of Commons">House of Commons</a> as a whole. His style is sometimes said to resemble that of a president and head of state rather than that of a prime minister in a parliamentary system of government.<sup id="_ref-43" class="reference"><a  title="">[48]</a></sup></p>
<p>Blair's apparent refusal to set a date for his departure has been criticised by the British press and members of parliament. It has been reported that a number of cabinet ministers believed that Blair's timely departure from office would be required to be able to win a fourth election. <sup id="_ref-independent-09-04-06_1" class="reference"><a  title="">[35]</a></sup> Some ministers viewed Blair's announcement of policy initiatives in September 2006 as an attempt to draw attention away from these issues. <sup id="_ref-independent-09-04-06_2" class="reference"><a  title="">[35]</a></sup> Upon his return from his holiday in the West Indies he announced that all the speculation about his leaving must stop. This stirred not only his traditional critics but also traditional party loyalists.</p>
<p>While the Blair government has introduced some social policies seen by the left of the Labour Party as progressive, such as the <a href="/wiki/Minimum_wage.html" title="Minimum wage">minimum wage</a> and measures to reduce child poverty, Blair is seen, on economic and management issues, as being to the right of the bulk of the party. A possible comparison may be made with <a href="/wiki/Al_Gore.html" title="Al Gore">Al Gore</a>, <a href="/wiki/Joe_Lieberman.html" title="Joe Lieberman">Joe Lieberman</a> and other <a href="/wiki/United_States_of_America.html" title="United States of America">American</a> <a href="/wiki/Democratic_Party_%28United_States%29.html" title="Democratic Party (United States)">Democrats</a>, who have been accused by their party's "base" of selling out to conservative ideology. Some critics describe Blair as a reconstructed <a href="/wiki/Conservative.html" title="Conservative">Conservative</a> or <a href="/wiki/Margaret_Thatcher.html" title="Margaret Thatcher">Thatcherite</a>. He is occasionally described as "Son of Thatcher", though <a href="/wiki/Margaret_Thatcher.html" title="Margaret Thatcher">Lady Thatcher</a> herself rejected this identification in an interview with <a href="/wiki/ITV1.html" title="ITV1">ITV1</a> on the night of the 2005 election, claiming that the resemblances were superficial.</p>
<p>Blair has avoided the traditional pigeonholes of British political leaders. He has often (particularly after the invasion of Iraq) been labelled as insincere ("King of Spin", "Phoney Tony"), and has been accused of <a href="/wiki/Cronyism.html" title="Cronyism">cronyism</a> due to his perceived penchant for promoting his friends to top jobs. In his early years, Blair was often criticised as an unscrupulous opportunist who was solely interested in doing anything that would get him elected, that he was a <a href="/wiki/Focus_group.html" title="Focus group">focus group</a> politician. More recently, his unpopular support of the United States over Iraq has demonstrated a politician with more commitment to his own beliefs, despite public opposition. His name has been deliberately mis-spelt 'Tony Bliar' (sometimes 'B. Liar') or 'Tory Blur' by critics of his actions and his policies (particularly his stance on Iraq). <i><a href="/wiki/The_Economist.html" title="The Economist">The Economist</a></i> on <a href="/wiki/June_5.html" title="June 5">5 June</a> <a href="/wiki/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a> devoted its front cover to a photograph of Blair and the headline, "Bliar?".</p>
