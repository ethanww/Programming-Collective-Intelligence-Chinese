			<p>The <b>Equal Protection Clause</b>, part of the <a href="/wiki/Fourteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution.html" title="Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution">Fourteenth Amendment</a> to the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Constitution.html" title="United States Constitution">United States Constitution</a>, provides that "no <a href="/wiki/U.S._state.html" title="U.S. state">state</a> shall… deny to any person within its <a href="/wiki/Jurisdiction.html" title="Jurisdiction">jurisdiction</a> the equal protection of the <a href="/wiki/Law.html" title="Law">laws</a>." The Equal Protection Clause can be seen as an attempt to secure the promise of the <a href="/wiki/United_States.html" title="United States">United States</a>' professed commitment to the proposition that "<a href="/wiki/All_men_are_created_equal.html" title="All men are created equal">all men are created equal</a>".</p>
<p>More concretely, the Equal Protection Clause, along with the rest of the Fourteenth Amendment, marked a great shift in American constitutionalism. Before the enactment of the Fourteenth Amendment, the Constitution protected individual rights only from invasion by the <a href="/wiki/Federal_Government_of_the_United_States.html" title="Federal Government of the United States">federal government</a>. After the Fourteenth Amendment was enacted, the Constitution also protected rights from abridgement by state governments — henceforth they could not, among other things, deprive people of the equal protection of the laws. What exactly such a requirement means, of course, has been the subject of great debate; and the story of the Equal Protection Clause is the gradual explication of its meaning.</p>
<p>For a long while after the Clause became a part of the Constitution, it was interpreted narrowly. During and after <a href="/wiki/World_War_II.html" title="World War II">World War II</a>, however, the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Supreme_Court.html" title="United States Supreme Court">United States Supreme Court</a> began to construe the Clause more expansively. During the 1960s, the other two branches of the federal government — the <a href="/wiki/Executive_branch.html" title="Executive branch">executive</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Legislative_branch.html" title="Legislative branch">legislative</a> — joined in, as <a href="/wiki/Congress_of_the_United_States.html" title="Congress of the United States">Congress</a> and the <a href="/wiki/President_of_the_United_States.html" title="President of the United States">President</a> passed and enforced legislation intended to ensure <a href="/wiki/Egalitarianism.html" title="Egalitarianism">equality</a> in <a href="/wiki/Education.html" title="Education">education</a>, <a href="/wiki/Employment.html" title="Employment">employment</a>, <a href="/wiki/Housing.html" title="Housing">housing</a>, <a href="/wiki/Lodging.html" title="Lodging">lodging</a>, and government benefits. While an expansive reading of the Clause was undercut, to some extent, by Court decisions of the 1970s and 1980s, the Equal Protection Clause remains an integral part of <a href="/wiki/United_States_constitutional_law.html" title="United States constitutional law">U.S. constitutional law</a>.</p>

Congressman <a href="/wiki/John_Bingham.html" title="John Bingham">John Bingham</a> of <a href="/wiki/Ohio.html" title="Ohio">Ohio</a> was the principal framer of the Equal Protection Clause.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The Fourteenth Amendment was enacted in 1868, shortly after the Union victory in the <a href="/wiki/American_Civil_War.html" title="American Civil War">American Civil War</a>. Though the <a href="/wiki/Thirteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution.html" title="Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution">Thirteenth Amendment</a>, which was proposed by Congress and <a href="/wiki/Article_Five_of_the_United_States_Constitution#Ratification.html" title="Article Five of the United States Constitution">ratified</a> by the states in 1865, had <a href="/wiki/Abolitionism.html" title="Abolitionism">abolished</a> <a href="/wiki/Slavery.html" title="Slavery">slavery</a>, many ex-<a href="/wiki/Confederate_States_of_America.html" title="Confederate States of America">Confederate</a> states adopted <a href="/wiki/Black_Codes.html" title="Black Codes">Black Codes</a> following the war.</p>
<p>These laws severely restricted the power of blacks to hold <a href="/wiki/Property.html" title="Property">property</a> and form legally enforceable <a href="/wiki/Contract.html" title="Contract">contracts</a>. They also created harsher criminal penalties for blacks than for whites.<span class="reference"><sup id="fn_1_back"><a  title="">1</a></sup></span></p>
<p>In response to the Black Codes, Congress enacted the <a href="/wiki/Civil_Rights_Act_of_1866.html" title="Civil Rights Act of 1866">Civil Rights Act of 1866</a>, which provided that all those born in the United States were citizens of the United States (this provision was meant to overturn the Supreme Court's decision in <i><a href="/wiki/Dred_Scott_v._Sandford.html" title="Dred Scott v. Sandford">Dred Scott v. Sandford</a></i>), and required that "citizens of every <a href="/wiki/Race.html" title="Race">race</a> and color ... [have] full and equal benefit of all laws and proceedings for the security of person and property, as is enjoyed by white citizens."<span class="reference"><sup id="fn_2_back"><a  title="">2</a></sup></span></p>
<p>Doubts about whether Congress could legitimately enact such a law under the then-existing Constitution led Congress to begin to draft and debate what would become the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The effort was led by the <a href="/wiki/Radical_Republicans.html" title="Radical Republicans">Radical Republicans</a> of both houses of Congress, including <a href="/wiki/John_Bingham.html" title="John Bingham">John Bingham</a>, <a href="/wiki/Charles_Sumner.html" title="Charles Sumner">Charles Sumner</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Thaddeus_Stevens.html" title="Thaddeus Stevens">Thaddeus Stevens</a>. The most important among these, however, was Bingham, a Congressman from <a href="/wiki/Ohio.html" title="Ohio">Ohio</a>, who drafted the language of the Equal Protection Clause.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/U.S._Southern_states.html" title="U.S. Southern states">Southern states</a>, of course, were opposed to the Civil Rights Act, but in 1865 Congress, exercising its power under Article I, section 5, clause 1 of the Constitution, to "be the Judge of the … Qualifications of its own Members," had excluded Southerners from Congress, declaring that their states, having seceded from the Union, could therefore not elect members to Congress. It was this fact—the fact that the Fourteenth Amendment was enacted by a "<a href="/wiki/Rump_legislature.html" title="Rump legislature">rump</a>" Congress—that allowed the Equal Protection Clause, which white Southerners almost uniformly hated, to be passed by Congress and proposed to the states. Its ratification by the former Confederate states was made a condition of their reacceptance into the Union.<span class="reference"><sup id="fn_3_back"><a  title="">3</a></sup></span></p>
<p>By its terms, the Clause restrains only state governments. However, the <a href="/wiki/Fifth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution.html" title="Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution">Fifth Amendment</a>'s <a href="/wiki/Due_process.html" title="Due process">due process</a> guarantee, beginning with <i><a href="/wiki/Bolling_v._Sharpe.html" title="Bolling v.

The Court that decided <i>Plessy</i></div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The first truly landmark equal protection decision by the Supreme Court was <i><a href="/wiki/Strauder_v._West_Virginia.html" title="Strauder v. West Virginia">Strauder v. West Virginia</a></i> (1880). A black man convicted of murder by an all-white <a href="/wiki/Jury.html" title="Jury">jury</a> challenged a <a href="/wiki/West_Virginia.html" title="West Virginia">West Virginia</a> <a href="/wiki/Statute.html" title="Statute">statute</a> excluding blacks from serving on juries. The Court asserted that the purpose of the Clause was</p>
<blockquote>
<p>to assure to the colored race the enjoyment of all the civil rights that under the law are enjoyed by white persons, and to give to that race the protection of the general government, in that enjoyment, whenever it should be denied by the States.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Exclusion of blacks from juries, the Court concluded, was a denial of equal protection to black defendants, since the jury had been "drawn from a panel from which the State has expressly excluded every man of [the defendant's] race."</p>
<p>The next important postwar case was the <i><a href="/wiki/Civil_Rights_Cases.html" title="Civil Rights Cases">Civil Rights Cases</a></i> (1883), in which the constitutionality of the <a href="/wiki/Civil_Rights_Act_of_1875.html" title="Civil Rights Act of 1875">Civil Rights Act of 1875</a> was at issue. The Act provided that all persons should have "full and equal enjoyment of ... inns, <a href="/wiki/Common_carriers.html" title="Common carriers">public conveyances</a> on land or water, theatres, and other places of public amusement." In its opinion, the Court promulgated what has since become known as the "State Action Doctrine," which limits the guarantees of the Equal Protection Clause only to acts done or otherwise "sanctioned in some way" by the state. Prohibiting blacks from attending plays or staying in inns was "simply a private wrong," provided, of course, that the state's law saw it as a wrong. <a href="/wiki/Associate_Justice_of_the_Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States.html" title="Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States">Justice</a> <a href="/wiki/John_Marshall_Harlan.html" title="John Marshall Harlan">John Marshall Harlan</a> dissented alone, saying, "I cannot resist the conclusion that the substance and spirit of the recent amendments of the Constitution have been sacrificed by a subtle and ingenious verbal criticism."</p>
<p>Harlan went on to argue that because (1) "public conveyances on land and water" use the public highways, and (2) innkeepers engage in what is "a quasi-public employment," and (3) "places of public amusement" are licensed under the laws of the states, excluding blacks from using these services <i>was</i> an act sanctioned by the state.</p>
<p>In its most notorious post-war reinterpretation of the Equal Protection Clause, <i><a href="/wiki/Plessy_v._Ferguson.html" title="Plessy v. Ferguson">Plessy v. Ferguson</a></i> (1896), the Supreme Court upheld a <a href="/wiki/Louisiana.html" title="Louisiana">Louisiana</a> <a href="/wiki/Jim_Crow_law.html" title="Jim Crow law">Jim Crow law</a> that required the <a href="/wiki/Racial_segregation.html" title="Racial segregation">segregation</a> of blacks and whites on <a href="/wiki/Rail_transport.html" title="Rail transport">railroads</a> and mandated separate railway cars for members of the two races.<span class="reference"><sup id="fn_4_back"><a  title="">4</a></sup></span> The Court, speaking through Justice <a href="/wiki/Henry_B._Brown.html" title="Henry B. Brown">Henry B. Brown</a>, ruled that the Equal Protection Clause had been intended to defend equality in <a href="/wiki/Civil_rights.html" title="Civil rights">civil rights</a>, not equality in <a href="/wiki/Social_rule.html" title="Social rule">social arrangements</a>. All that was therefore required of the law was reasonableness, and Louisiana's railway law amply met that requirement, being based on "the established usages, <a href="/wiki/Norm_%28sociology%29.html" title="Norm (sociology)">customs</a> and <a href="/wiki/Tradition.html" title="Tradition">traditions</a> of the people."</p>
<p>Justice Harlan again dissented. "Every one knows," he wrote,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>that the statute in question had its origin in the purpose, not so much to exclude white persons from railroad cars occupied by blacks, as to exclude colored people from coaches occupied by or assigned to white persons.... [I]n view of the Constitution, in the eye of the law, there is in this country no superior, dominant, ruling class of citizens. There is no <a href="/wiki/Caste.html" title="Caste">caste</a> here. Our Constitution is color-blind, and neither knows nor tolerates classes among citizens.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Such "arbitrary separation" by race, Harlan concluded, was "a badge of servitude wholly inconsistent with the civil freedom and the equality before the law established by the Constitution."<span class="reference"><sup id="fn_5_back"><a  title="">5</a></sup></span></p>
<p>Since <i><a href="/wiki/Brown_v._Board_of_Education.html" title="Brown v. Board of Education">Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas</a></i> (1954), Justice Harlan's dissent in <i>Plessy</i> has been vindicated as a matter of legal doctrine, and the Clause has been interpreted as imposing a general restraint on the government's power to <a href="/wiki/Discrimination.html" title="Discrimination">discriminate</a> against people based on their membership in certain classes, including those based on race and sex (see <a  title="">below</a>).</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Between Plessy and Brown">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Between_Plessy_and_Brown" id="Between_Plessy_and_Brown"></a></p>
<h2>Between <i>Plessy</i> and <i>Brown</i></h2>
<p>Thus the <i>Plessy</i> majority's interpretation of the Clause stood until <i>Brown</i>. However, the holding of <i>Brown</i> was prefigured, to some extent, by several earlier cases.</p>
<p>The first of these was <i><a href="/wiki/Missouri_ex_rel._Gaines_v._Canada.html" title="Missouri ex rel. Gaines v. Canada">Missouri ex rel. Gaines v. Canada</a></i> (1938), in which a black student at <a href="/wiki/Missouri.html" title="Missouri">Missouri</a>'s all-black college sought admission to the law school at the all-white <a href="/wiki/University_of_Missouri.html" title="University of Missouri">University of Missouri</a>—there being no law school at the all-black college. Admission was denied him, and the Supreme Court, applying the separate-but-equal principle of <i>Plessy</i>, held that a State's offering a legal education to whites but not to blacks violated the Equal Protection Clause.</p>
<p><i><a href="/wiki/Smith_v._Allwright.html" title="Smith v. Allwright">Smith v. Allwright</a></i> (1944) and <i><a href="/wiki/Shelley_v._Kraemer.html" title="Shelley v. Kraemer">Shelley v. Kraemer</a></i> (1948), though not dealing with education, indicated the Court's increased willingness to find racial discrimination illegal. <i>Smith</i> declared that the <a href="/wiki/Democratic_Party_%28United_States%29.html" title="Democratic Party (United States)">Democratic</a> <a href="/wiki/Primary_election.html" title="Primary election">primary</a> in <a href="/wiki/Texas.html" title="Texas">Texas</a>, in which voting was restricted to whites alone, was unconstitutional, partly on equal protection grounds. <i>Shelley</i> concerned a privately made contract that prohibited "people of the Negro or Mongolian race" from living on a particular piece of land. Seeming to go against the spirit, if not the exact letter, of <i>The Civil Rights Cases</i>, the Court found that, although a discriminatory private contract could not violate the Equal Protection Clause, the courts' <i>enforcement</i> of such a contract could: after all, the Supreme Court reasoned, courts were part of the state.</p>
<p>More important, however, were the companion cases <i><a href="/wiki/Sweatt_v._Painter.html" title="Sweatt v. Painter">Sweatt v. Painter</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/McLaurin_v._Oklahoma_State_Regents.html" title="McLaurin v. Oklahoma State Regents">McLaurin v. Oklahoma State Regents</a></i>, both decided in 1950. In <i>McLaurin</i>, the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Oklahoma.html" title="University of Oklahoma">University of Oklahoma</a> had admitted McLaurin, an African-American, but had restricted his activities there: he had to sit apart from the rest of the students in the classrooms and library, and could eat in the cafeteria only at a designated table. A unanimous Court, through <a href="/wiki/Chief_Justice_of_the_United_States.html" title="Chief Justice of the United States">Chief Justice</a> <a href="/wiki/Fred_M._Vinson.html" title="Fred M. Vinson">Fred M. Vinson</a>, said that Oklahoma had deprived McLaurin of the equal protection of the laws:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is a vast difference—a Constitutional difference—between restrictions imposed by the state which prohibit the intellectual commingling of students, and the refusal of individuals to commingle where the state presents no such bar.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The present situation, Vinson said, was the former.</p>
<p>In <i>Sweatt</i>, the Court considered the constitutionality of Texas's state system of <a href="/wiki/Law_school.html" title="Law school">law schools</a>, which educated blacks and whites at separate institutions. The Court (again through Chief Justice Vinson, and again with no dissenters) invalidated the school system—not because it separated students, but rather because the separate facilities were not <i>equal</i>. They lacked "substantial equality in the educational opportunities" offered to their students.</p>

<h2><i>Brown</i> and its consequences</h2>
<p>When <a href="/wiki/Earl_Warren.html" title="Earl Warren">Earl Warren</a> became Chief Justice in 1953, <i>Brown</i> had already come before the Court. While Vinson was still Chief Justice, there had been a preliminary vote on the case at a conference of all nine justices. At that time, the Court had split, with a majority of the justices voting that school segregation did not violate the Equal Protection Clause. Warren, however, through persuasion and good-natured cajoling—he had been an extremely successful <a href="/wiki/Republican_Party_%28United_States%29.html" title="Republican Party (United States)">Republican</a> politician before joining the Court—was able to convince all eight associate justices to join his opinion declaring school segregation unconstitutional.<span class="reference"><sup id="fn_7_back"><a  title="">7</a></sup></span> In that opinion, Warren wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To separate [children in grade and high schools] from others of similar age and qualifications solely because of their race generates a feeling of inferiority as to their status in the community that may affect their hearts and minds in a way unlikely ever to be undone.... We conclude that in the field of public education the doctrine of "separate but equal" has no place. Separate educational facilities are inherently unequal.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Court then set the case for re-argument on the question of what the solution would be. In <i><a href="/wiki/Brown_v._Board_of_Education#Brown_II.html" title="Brown v. Board of Education">Brown II</a></i>, decided the next year, it was concluded that since the problems identified in the previous opinion were local, the solutions needed to be so as well. Thus the court devolved authority to local <a href="/wiki/Board_of_education.html" title="Board of education">school boards</a> and to the <a href="/wiki/United_States_district_court.html" title="United States district court">trial courts</a> that had originally heard the cases. (<i>Brown</i> had actually been comprised of four different cases from four different states.) The trial courts and localities were told to desegregate with "all deliberate speed".</p>

<p>Partly because that enigmatic phrase, but mostly because of self-declared "<a href="/wiki/Massive_resistance.html" title="Massive resistance">massive resistance</a>" in the South to the desegregation decision, <a href="/wiki/Racial_integration.html" title="Racial integration">integration</a> did not begin in any significant way until the mid-1960s and then only to a small degree. In fact, much of the integration in the 1960s happened in response not to <i>Brown</i> but to the <a href="/wiki/Civil_Rights_Act_of_1964.html" title="Civil Rights Act of 1964">Civil Rights Act of 1964</a>. The Supreme Court intervened a handful of times in the late 1950s and early 1960s, but its next major desegregation decision was <i><a  class="new" title="Green v. New Kent County School Board">Green v. New Kent County School Board</a></i> (1968), in which Justice <a href="/wiki/William_J._Brennan.html" title="William J. Brennan">William J. Brennan</a>, writing for a unanimous Court, rejected a "freedom-of-choice" school plan as inadequate. This was a significant act; freedom-of-choice plans had been very common responses to <i>Brown</i>. Under these plans, parents could choose to send their children to either a formerly white or a formerly black school. Whites almost never opted to attend black-identified schools, however, and blacks, from fear of violence or harassment, rarely attended white-identified schools.</p>
<p>In response to <i>Green</i>, many Southern districts replaced freedom-of-choice with geographically based schooling plans; but because residential segregation was widespread, this had little effect, either. In 1971, the Court in <i><a href="/wiki/Swann_v._Charlotte-Mecklenburg_Board_of_Education.html" title="Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education">Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education</a></i> approved busing as a remedy to segregation; three years later, though, in the case of <i><a href="/wiki/Milliken_v._Bradley.html" title="Milliken v. Bradley">Milliken v. Bradley</a></i> (1974), it set aside a lower court order that had required the busing of students <i>between</i> <a href="/wiki/School_district.html" title="School district">districts</a>, instead of merely <i>within</i> a district. <i>Milliken</i> basically ended the Supreme Court's major involvement in school desegregation; however, up through the 1990s many federal trial courts remained involved in school desegregation cases, many of which had begun in the '50s and '60s.<span class="reference"><sup id="fn_8_back"><a  title="">8</a></sup></span> American public school systems, especially in large metropolitan areas, to a large extent are still de facto segregated. Whether due to <i>Brown</i>, to Congressional action or to societal change, the percentage of black students attending school districts a majority of whose students were black decreased somewhat until the early 1980s, at which point that percentage began to increase. By the late 1990s, the percentage of black students in mostly minority school districts had returned to about what it was in the late 1960s.<span class="reference"><sup id="fn_9_back"><a  title="">9</a></sup></span></p>
<p>There are, very broadly speaking, two ways to explain America's marked lack of success in school integration in the five decades since <i>Brown</i>. One way, sometimes voiced by political <a href="/wiki/American_conservatism.html" title="American conservatism">conservatives</a>, argues that <i>Brown'</i>s relative failure is due to the inherent limitations of law and the courts, which simply do not have the institutional competence to supervise the desegregation of whole school districts. Moreover, the federal government's, and especially the Supreme Court's, hubris actually provoked the resistance of locals, since education in the United States is traditionally a matter for local control. The other way to explain what has happened since <i>Brown</i> often has political <a href="/wiki/American_Liberalism.html" title="American Liberalism">liberals</a> as its proponents; it argues that the Court's decree in <i>Brown II</i> was insufficiently rigorous to force segregated localities into action, and that real success began only after the other two branches of the federal government got involved—the Executive Branch (under <a href="/wiki/John_F._Kennedy.html" title="John F. Kennedy">Kennedy</a> and <a href="/wiki/Lyndon_Baines_Johnson.html" title="Lyndon Baines Johnson">Johnson</a>) by encouraging the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice.html" title="United States Department of Justice">Department of Justice</a> to pursue judicial remedies against resistant school districts, and Congress by passing the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the <a href="/wiki/Civil_Rights_Act_of_1968.html" title="Civil Rights Act of 1968">Civil Rights Act of 1968</a>.<span class="reference"><sup id="fn_10_back"><a  title="">10</a></sup></span> Liberals also point out that <a href="/wiki/Richard_Nixon.html" title="Richard Nixon">Richard Nixon</a>'s "<a href="/wiki/Southern_strategy.html" title="Southern strategy">southern strategy</a>" was premised on a tacit support of segregation that continued when Nixon came to office, so that after 1968 the Executive was no longer behind the Court's constitutional commitments.<span class="reference"><sup id="fn_11_back"><a  title="">11</a></sup></span></p>

</div>
<p>Despite the undoubted importance of <i>Brown</i>, much of modern equal protection jurisprudence stems from the <a href="/wiki/Footnote_four.html" title="Footnote four">fourth footnote</a> in <i><a href="/wiki/United_States_v._Carolene_Products_Co..html" title="United States v. Carolene Products Co.">United States v. Carolene Products Co.</a></i> (1938), a <a href="/wiki/Commerce_Clause.html" title="Commerce Clause">Commerce Clause</a> and <a href="/wiki/Due_Process#Substantive_Due_Process.html" title="Due Process">substantive due process</a> case. In 1937, the Court (in what was called the "<a href="/wiki/The_switch_in_time_that_saved_nine.html" title="The switch in time that saved nine">switch in time that saved nine</a>") had loosened its rules for deciding whether <a href="/wiki/United_States_Congress.html" title="United States Congress">Congress</a> could regulate certain commercial activities. In discussing the new presumption of constitutionality that the Court would apply to economic <a href="/wiki/Legislation.html" title="Legislation">legislation</a>, Justice <a href="/wiki/Harlan_Stone.html" title="Harlan Stone">Harlan Stone</a> wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[P]rejudice against discrete and insular minorities may be a special condition, which tends seriously to curtail the operation of those political processes ordinarily to be relied upon to protect minorities, and which may call for a correspondingly more searching judicial inquiry.<span class="reference"><sup id="fn_12_back"><a  title="">12</a></sup></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus were born the "more searching" levels of scrutiny—"strict" and "intermediate"—with which the Court would examine legislation directed at racial minorities and women. Although the Court first articulated a "strict scrutiny" standard for laws based on race-based distinctions in <i><a href="/wiki/Hirabayashi_v._United_States.html" title="Hirabayashi v. United States">Hirabayashi v. United States</a></i> (1943) and <i><a href="/wiki/Korematsu_v._United_States.html" title="Korematsu v. United States">Korematsu v. United States</a></i> (1944), the Court did not apply strict scrutiny, by that name, until the 1967 case of <i><a href="/wiki/Loving_v._Virginia.html" title="Loving v. Virginia">Loving v. Virginia</a></i>, and that intermediate scrutiny did not command the approbation of a majority of the Court until the 1976 case of <i><a href="/wiki/Craig_v._Boren.html" title="Craig v. Boren">Craig v. Boren</a></i>.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court has defined these levels of scrutiny in the following way:</p>
<ul>
<li><b><a href="/wiki/Strict_scrutiny.html" title="Strict scrutiny">Strict scrutiny</a></b> (if the law categorizes on the basis of race): the law is unconstitutional unless it is "narrowly tailored" to serve a "compelling" government interest. In addition, there cannot be a "less restrictive" alternative available to achieve that compelling interest.</li>
<li><b><a href="/wiki/Intermediate_scrutiny.html" title="Intermediate scrutiny">Intermediate scrutiny</a></b> (if the law categorizes on the basis of sex): the law is unconstitutional unless it is "substantially related" to an "important" government interest. Note that in past decisions "sex" generally has meant <a href="/wiki/Gender.html" title="Gender">gender</a>.</li>
<li><b><a href="/wiki/Rational_basis_review.html" title="Rational basis review">Rational-basis test</a></b> (if the law categorizes on some other basis): the law is constitutional so long as it is "reasonably related" to a "legitimate" government interest.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is, arguably, a fourth level of scrutiny for equal protection cases. In <i><a href="/wiki/United_States_v._Virginia.html" title="United States v. Virginia">United States v. Virginia</a></i> Justice <a href="/wiki/Ruth_Bader_Ginsburg.html" title="Ruth Bader Ginsburg">Ruth Bader Ginsburg</a> eschewed the language of intermediate scrutiny for sex-based discrimination and instead demanded that litigants demonstrate an "exceedingly persuasive" argument to justify gender discrimination. Whether this was simply a re-articulation of the doctrine of intermediate scrutiny or whether it created a new level of scrutiny between the intermediate and strict standards is unclear.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Discriminatory intent or disparate impact?">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Discriminatory_intent_or_disparate_impact.3F" id="Discriminatory_intent_or_disparate_impact.3F"></a></p>
<h2>Discriminatory intent or disparate impact?</h2>
<p>Another controversial area of equal protection <i>theory</i>—although it seems that the legal <i>doctrine</i> has been settled by the Supreme Court—is the issue of whether an equal protection violation requires <i>purposeful</i> discrimination, or whether it merely requires what is termed "disparate impact."</p>
<p>In other words, does the Equal Protection Clause outlaw public policies that cause racial disparities—for example, a public school examination that more white students than black students pass? Or, on the other hand, does it merely outlaw intentional <a href="/wiki/Bigotry.html" title="Bigotry">bigotry</a> by public officials?</p>
<p>The Supreme Court has answered: It depends. In the context of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which forbids job discrimination on the basis of race, national origin, sex or religion—and applies both to private and to public employers—the Supreme Court has answered (in <i><a href="/wiki/Griggs_v._Duke_Power_Co..html" title="Griggs v. Duke Power Co.">Griggs v. Duke Power Co.</a></i> (1971)) that (1) if an employer's policy has disparate racial consequences, and (2) if the employer can't give a reasonable justification for such a policy on grounds of "business necessity," then the employer's policy violates Title VII. In the years since <i>Griggs</i>, courts have defined "business necessity" as requiring the employer to prove that whatever is causing the racial disparity—be it a test, an educational requirement, a hiring practice—has a demonstrable factual relationship to making the company more profitable.<span class="reference"><sup id="fn_13_back"><a  title="">13</a></sup></span></p>
<p>In most other situations, however, the Court's focus is on discriminatory intent. This was made clear in the seminal case of <i><a  class="new" title="Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Corp.">Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Corp.</a></i> (1977). In that case, the plaintiff, a housing developer, sued a <a href="/wiki/Chicago%2C_Illinois.html" title="Chicago, Illinois">Chicago</a> suburb that had refused to <a href="/wiki/Zoning.html" title="Zoning">rezone</a> a plot of land in order to allow low-income, racially integrated housing to be built. There was no clear evidence of racially discriminatory intent on the part of <a href="/wiki/Arlington_Heights%2C_Illinois.html" title="Arlington Heights, Illinois">Arlington Heights's</a> planning commission; the result, however, was racially disparate, since the refusal prevented more African-Americans and Hispanics than whites from moving in. Justice <a href="/wiki/Lewis_Franklin_Powell_Jr..html" title="Lewis Franklin Powell Jr.">Lewis Powell</a>, writing for the Court, stated, "Proof of racially discriminatory intent or purpose is required to show a violation of the Equal Protection Clause." Disparate impact merely has an <a href="/wiki/Evidence.html" title="Evidence">evidentiary</a> value; absent a "stark" pattern, said the Court, "impact is not determinative." (See also <i><a href="/wiki/Washington_v._Davis.html" title="Washington v. Davis">Washington v. Davis</a></i> (1976).)</p>
<p>Defenders of the Court's approach in <i>Arlington Heights</i> and <i>Washington v. Davis</i> argue that the Equal Protection Clause was not intended to guarantee <a href="/wiki/Equality_of_outcome.html" title="Equality of outcome">equal outcomes</a>, but rather <a href="/wiki/Equal_opportunity.html" title="Equal opportunity">equal opportunities</a>; and that, therefore, we shouldn't be concerned with trying to fix every racially disparate effect—we should worry about only intentional bigotry. Others point out that the courts are merely enforcing the Equal Protection Clause, and that if the legislature wants to correct racially disparate effects, it may do so through further legislation.<span class="reference"><sup id="fn_14_back"><a  title="">14</a></sup></span> Critics of the approach, however, contend that focusing on intent and according only an evidentiary value to disparate racial impact misses the point. Racial bigotry, they say, is, especially nowadays, unconscious; giving much more weight to disparate impact can remedy the kind of <a href="/wiki/Unconscious_mind.html" title="Unconscious mind">unconscious</a> <a href="/wiki/Racism.html" title="Racism">racism</a> that a requirement of conscious discriminatory intent cannot.<span class="reference"><sup id="fn_15_back"><a  title="">15</a></sup></span> This debate, though, goes on almost entirely in the academy, since the Supreme Court has not changed its basic approach as outlined in <i>Arlington Heights</i>.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Suspect classes">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Suspect_classes" id="Suspect_classes"></a></p>
<h2>Suspect classes</h2>
<p>The Supreme Court has seemed unwilling to extend "suspect class" status (i.e., status that makes a law that categorizes on that basis suspect, and therefore deserving of greater judicial scrutiny) to groups other than women and racial minorities. In <i><a href="/wiki/City_of_Cleburne_v._Cleburne_Living_Center%2C_Inc..html" title="City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Center, Inc.">City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Center, Inc.</a></i> (1985), the Court refused to make the <a href="/wiki/Mentally_retarded.html" title="Mentally retarded">mentally retarded</a> a suspect class. Many commentators have noted, however—and Justice Marshall so notes in his partial concurrence—that the Court does appear to examine the City of Cleburne's denial of a permit to a group home for mentally retarded people with a significantly higher degree of scrutiny than is typically associated with the rational-basis test.</p>
<p>In <i><a href="/wiki/Lawrence_v._Texas.html" title="Lawrence v. Texas">Lawrence v. Texas</a></i> (2003), the Court struck down a Texas statute prohibiting <a href="/wiki/Homosexual.html" title="Homosexual">homosexual</a> <a href="/wiki/Sodomy.html" title="Sodomy">sodomy</a> on substantive due process grounds. In Justice <a href="/wiki/Sandra_Day_O%27Connor.html" title="Sandra Day O'Connor">Sandra Day O'Connor</a>'s opinion concurring in the judgment, however, she argued that by prohibiting only <i>homosexual</i> sodomy, and not <i>heterosexual</i> sodomy as well, Texas's statute did not meet rational-basis review under the Equal Protection Clause; her opinion prominently cited <i>City of Cleburne</i>.</p>
<p>Notably, O'Connor did not claim to apply a higher level of scrutiny than mere rational basis, and as a larger matter the Court has not extended suspect-class status to <a href="/wiki/Gay.html" title="Gay">gays</a> or <a href="/wiki/Lesbian.html" title="Lesbian">lesbians</a>. Much as in <i>City of Cleburne</i>, though, the Court's decision in <i><a href="/wiki/Romer_v._Evans.html" title="Romer v. Evans">Romer v. Evans</a></i> (1996), on which O'Connor also relied in her <i>Lawrence</i> opinion, and which struck down a <a href="/wiki/Colorado.html" title="Colorado">Colorado</a> constitutional amendment aimed at denying homosexuals "minority status, quota preferences, protected status or [a] claim of discrimination," seemed to employ a markedly higher level of scrutiny than the nominally applied rational-basis test. It seems probable, therefore, that the Court, whatever it may decide about the constitutionality of laws that prohibit <a href="/wiki/Same-sex_marriage.html" title="Same-sex marriage">same-sex unions</a>, will not explicitly apply heightened scrutiny to them; however, this question is unresolved. It has been argued that discrimination based on sex should be interpreted to include discrimination based on <a href="/wiki/Sexual_orientation.html" title="Sexual orientation">sexual orientation</a>, in which case intermediate scrutiny could apply to gay rights cases.<span class="reference"><sup id="fn_16_back"><a  title="">16</a></sup></span></p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Affirmative action">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Affirmative_action" id="Affirmative_action"></a></p>
<h2>Affirmative action</h2>
<p><a href="/wiki/Affirmative_action.html" title="Affirmative action">Affirmative action</a> is the policy of consciously setting racial, ethnic, religious, or other kinds of <a href="/wiki/Diversity.html" title="Diversity">diversity</a> as a goal within an organization, and, in order to meet this goal, purposely selecting people from certain groups that have historically been oppressed or denied equal opportunities. In affirmative action, individuals of one or more of these minority backgrounds are preferred—<i><a href="/wiki/Ceteris_paribus.html" title="Ceteris paribus">ceteris paribus</a></i>—over those who do not have such characteristics; such a preferential scheme is sometimes effected through <a href="/wiki/Racial_quota.html" title="Racial quota">quotas</a>, though this need not necessarily be so.</p>
<p>Although there were forms of what is now called affirmative action during the <a href="/wiki/Reconstruction.html" title="Reconstruction">Reconstruction</a> (most of which were implemented by the same persons who framed the Fourteenth Amendment<span class="reference"><sup id="fn_17_back"><a  title="">17</a></sup></span>) the modern history of affirmative action began with the Kennedy administration and started to flourish during the Johnson administration, with the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and two <a href="/wiki/Executive_Order.html" title="Executive Order">Executive Orders</a>. These policies directed agencies of the federal government to employ a proportionate number of minorities whenever possible.<span class="reference"><sup id="fn_18_back"><a  title="">18</a></sup></span></p>
<p>Several important affirmative action cases to reach the Supreme Court have concerned government <a href="/wiki/Independent_contractor.html" title="Independent contractor">contractors</a>—for instance, <i><a href="/wiki/Adarand_Constructors_v._Pe%C3%B1a.html" title="Adarand Constructors v. Peña">Adarand Constructors v. Peña</a></i> (1995) and <i><a  class="new" title="City of Richmond v. J.A. Croson Co.">City of Richmond v. J.A. Croson Co.</a></i> (1989). But the most famous cases have dealt with affirmative action as practiced by <a href="/wiki/Public_university.html" title="Public university">public universities</a>: <i><a href="/wiki/Regents_of_the_University_of_California_v._Bakke.html" title="Regents of the University of California v. Bakke">Regents of the University of California v. Bakke</a></i> (1978), and two companion cases decided by the Supreme Court in 2003, <i><a href="/wiki/Grutter_v._Bollinger.html" title="Grutter v. Bollinger">Grutter v. Bollinger</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Gratz_v._Bollinger.html" title="Gratz v. Bollinger">Gratz v. Bollinger</a></i>.</p>
<p>In <i>Bakke</i>, the Court held that racial quotas are unconstitutional, but that educational institutions could legally use race as one of many factors to consider in their <a href="/wiki/Admissions.html" title="Admissions">admissions</a> process. In <i>Grutter</i> and <i>Gratz</i>, the Court upheld both <i>Bakke</i> as a precedent and the admissions policy of the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Michigan.html" title="University of Michigan">University of Michigan</a> law school. In <a href="/wiki/Dicta.html" title="Dicta">dicta</a>, however, Justice O'Connor, writing for the Court, said she expected that in 25 years, racial preferences would no longer be necessary. In <i>Gratz</i>, the Court invalidated Michigan's undergraduate admissions policy, on the grounds that unlike the law school's policy, which treated race not as one of many factors in an admissions process that looked to the individual applicant, the undergraduate policy used a point system that was excessively mechanistic.</p>
<p>In these affirmative action cases, the Supreme Court has employed, or has said it employed, strict scrutiny, since the affirmative action policies challenged by the plaintiffs categorized by race. The policy in <i>Grutter</i>, and the Harvard College policy discussed by Justice Powell's opinion in <i>Bakke</i>, passed muster because the Court deemed that they were narrowly tailored to achieve a compelling interest in diversity. On one side, critics have argued that the scrutiny the Court has applied is much less searching than true strict scrutiny, and that the Court has acted not as a principled legal institution but as a biased political one.<span class="reference"><sup id="fn_19_back"><a  title="">19</a></sup></span> On the other side, it is argued that the purpose of the Equal Protection Clause is to prevent the socio-political subordination of some groups by others, not to prevent classification; since this is so, non-invidious classifications, such as those used by affirmative action programs, should not be subjected to heightened scrutiny.<span class="reference"><sup id="fn_20_back"><a  title="">20</a></sup></span></p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: The Equal Protection Clause and voting">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="The_Equal_Protection_Clause_and_voting" id="The_Equal_Protection_Clause_and_voting"></a></p>
<h2>The Equal Protection Clause and voting</h2>
<p>Although the Supreme Court ruled in <i>Nixon v. Herndon</i> (1927) and <i><a href="/wiki/Gomillion_v._Lightfoot.html" title="Gomillion v. Lightfoot">Gomillion v. Lightfoot</a></i> (1960) that the Constitution prohibited denial of the vote based on race, those decisions were based on the <a href="/wiki/Fifteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution.html" title="Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution">Fifteenth Amendment</a>. The first significant application of the Equal Protection Clause to voting law came in <i><a href="/wiki/Baker_v._Carr.html" title="Baker v. Carr">Baker v. Carr</a></i> (1962), where the Court ruled that the districts that sent representatives to the <a href="/wiki/Tennessee.html" title="Tennessee">Tennessee</a> <a href="/wiki/State_legislature.html" title="State legislature">state legislature</a> were so malapportioned (with some legislators representing ten times the number of residents as others) that they violated the Equal Protection Clause. This ruling was extended two years later in <i><a href="/wiki/Reynolds_v._Sims.html" title="Reynolds v. Sims">Reynolds v. Sims</a></i> (1964), in which a "one man, one vote" standard was laid down: in both houses of state legislatures, each resident had to be given equal weight in representation.</p>
<p>It may seem counterintuitive that the Equal Protection Clause should provide for equal <a href="/wiki/Voting_rights.html" title="Voting rights">voting rights</a>; after all, it would seem to make the Fifteenth Amendment and the <a href="/wiki/Nineteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution.html" title="Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution">Nineteenth Amendment</a> redundant. Indeed, it was on this argument, as well as on the legislative history of the Fourteenth Amendment, that Justice <a href="/wiki/John_Marshall_Harlan_II.html" title="John Marshall Harlan II">John M. Harlan</a> (the grandson of the earlier Justice Harlan) relied in his dissent from <i>Reynolds</i>. Harlan quoted the congressional debates of 1866 to show that the framers did not intend for the Equal Protection Clause to extend to voting rights, and in reference to the Fifteenth and Nineteenth Amendments, he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If constitutional amendment was the only means by which all men and, later, women, could be guaranteed the right to vote at all, even for <i>federal</i> officers, how can it be that the far less obvious right to a particular kind of apportionment of <i>state</i> legislatures... can be conferred by judicial construction of the Fourteenth Amendment? <i>[Emphasis in the original.]</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, <i>Reynolds</i> and <i>Baker</i> do not lack a rationale, if seen in a broader perspective. The Supreme Court has repeatedly stated that voting is a "fundamental right" on the same plane as marriage (<i>Loving v. Virginia</i>), privacy (<i><a href="/wiki/Griswold_v._Connecticut.html" title="Griswold v. Connecticut">Griswold v. Connecticut</a></i> (1965)), or interstate travel (<i>Shapiro v. Thompson</i> (1969)). For any abridgment of those rights to be constitutional, the Court has held, the legislation must pass strict scrutiny.<span class="reference"><sup id="fn_21_back"><a  title="">21</a></sup></span> Thus, on this account, equal protection jurisprudence may be appropriately applied to voting rights.</p>
<p>A recent use of Equal Protection doctrine came in <i><a href="/wiki/Bush_v._Gore.html" title="Bush v. Gore">Bush v. Gore</a></i> (2000). At issue was the controversial recount in <a href="/wiki/Florida.html" title="Florida">Florida</a> in the aftermath of the <a href="/wiki/U.S._presidential_election%2C_2000.html" title="U.S. presidential election, 2000">2000 presidential election</a>. There, the Supreme Court decided that the different standards of counting ballots across Florida violated the Equal Protection Clause. It was not this decision that proved especially controversial among commentators, and indeed, the proposition gained seven out of nine votes; Justices <a href="/wiki/David_Souter.html" title="David Souter">Souter</a> and <a href="/wiki/Stephen_Breyer.html" title="Stephen Breyer">Breyer</a> joined the majority of five—but only, it should be emphasized, for the finding that there was an Equal Protection violation. What was controversial was, first, the <a href="/wiki/Judicial_remedy.html" title="Judicial remedy">remedy</a> upon which the majority agreed—that even though there was an Equal Protection violation, there was not enough time for a recount—and second, the suggestion that the Equal Protection violation was true only on the facts of <i>Bush v. Gore</i>; commentators suggested that this meant that the Court did not wish its decision to have any <a href="/wiki/Precedent.html" title="Precedent">precedential</a> effect, and that this was evidence of its unprincipled decision-making.<span class="reference"><sup id="fn_22_back"><a  title="">22</a></sup></span></p>

Rather, due to the fact that much of what those Acts regulate is "private" conduct under the rubric laid down by the <i>Civil Rights Cases</i>, the Acts were passed by Congress under its Commerce Clause powers.

<li><cite id="fn_13"><a  title="">Note 13</a>:</cite> Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 is applied to private employers such as Griggs Power through Congress's Commerce Clause power, not through the Fourteenth Amendment. (This is, of course, consistent with the state action doctrine articulated in the <i>Civil Rights Cases</i>.) However, Title VII also applies to public employers, and the Supreme Court has consistently applied the same disparate impact doctrine to both private and public employers.

<li><cite id="fn_21"><a  title="">Note 21</a>:</cite> The rights to privacy and to interstate travel are part of the Supreme Court's substantive due process jurisprudence, and therefore are not derived from the Equal Protection Clause; rather, the Court imported the <i>standard</i> of strict scrutiny from Equal Protection jurisprudence into substantive due process jurisprudence. This "importation" is further complicated by the fact that some cases, such as <i>Loving v. Virginia</i>, actually <i>combine</i> Equal Protection issues with substantive due process issues. The right to vote, however, seems to be an exception to the foregoing, in that the substantive right to vote appears to derive not from the Due Process Clause but from the Equal Protection Clause.
