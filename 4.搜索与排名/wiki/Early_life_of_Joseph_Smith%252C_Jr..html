<p>The <b>early life of Joseph Smith, Jr.</b> covers the period from his birth on <a href="/wiki/December_23.html" title="December 23">December 23</a>, <a href="/wiki/1805.html" title="1805">1805</a>, to the end of 1827, when Latter Day Saints believe Smith located a set of <a href="/wiki/Golden_Plates.html" title="Golden Plates">Golden Plates</a> engraved with ancient <a href="/wiki/Christianity.html" title="Christianity">Christian</a> scriptures, buried in <a href="/wiki/Cumorah.html" title="Cumorah">a hill</a> near his home in <a href="/wiki/Manchester_%28town%29%2C_New_York.html" title="Manchester (town), New York">Manchester</a>, <a href="/wiki/New_York.html" title="New York">New York</a>.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr..html" title="Joseph Smith, Jr.">Joseph Smith, Jr.</a> was the principal founder and leader of the <a href="/wiki/Latter_Day_Saint_movement.html" title="Latter Day Saint movement">Latter Day Saint movement</a>, also known as <a href="/wiki/Mormonism.html" title="Mormonism">Mormonism</a>, which includes such denominations as <a href="/wiki/The_Church_of_Jesus_Christ_of_Latter-day_Saints.html" title="The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints">The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Community_of_Christ.html" title="Community of Christ">Community of Christ</a>. Smith's followers revere him as a <a href="/wiki/End_times.html" title="End times">latter-day</a> <a href="/wiki/Prophet.html" title="Prophet">prophet</a>.</p>
<p>This early period of Smith's life is significant within Mormonism because it represents the time when Smith first claimed to act as a prophet, to have had a <a href="/wiki/Theophany.html" title="Theophany">theophany</a> (called by his followers the <a href="/wiki/First_Vision.html" title="First Vision">First Vision</a>), and to have obtained the Golden Plates, purportedly the source material for the <i><a href="/wiki/Book_of_Mormon.html" title="Book of Mormon">Book of Mormon</a></i>, a <a href="/wiki/Latter_Day_Saint.html" title="Latter Day Saint">Latter Day Saint</a> <a href="/wiki/Sacred_text.html" title="Sacred text">sacred text</a>. During this period, Smith was influenced by numerous religious and cultural trends in early <a href="/wiki/United_States.html" title="United States">United States</a> history. The nation at the time was undergoing a cultural reaction against the <a href="/wiki/Secularism.html" title="Secularism">secularism</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Age_of_Enlightenment.html" title="Age of Enlightenment">Age of Enlightenment</a>, called the <a href="/wiki/Second_Great_Awakening.html" title="Second Great Awakening">Second Great Awakening</a>. In addition, Americans' widespread acceptance of <a href="/wiki/Folk_religion.html" title="Folk religion">folk religion</a> up until the 1830s and a growing interest in forming separate religious communities created ripe conditions for a young man such as Smith to successfully build a religion based on the appearance of <a href="/wiki/Angel.html" title="Angel">angels</a> and the miraculous translation of ancient records. Latter Day Saints view the events in Smith's early life as evidencing his <a href="/wiki/Priesthood_%28Mormonism%29#Calling_and_ordination.html" title="Priesthood (Mormonism)">calling</a> as a <a href="/wiki/Prophet#Latter-day_Saint_concept_of_prophets.html" title="Prophet">prophet</a> and as providing the basis for organizing the <a href="/wiki/Church_of_Christ_%28Mormonism%29.html" title="Church of Christ (Mormonism)">Church of Christ</a>.</p>

<h2>Smith's childhood</h2>
<p>Smith was born in <a href="/wiki/Sharon%2C_Vermont.html" title="Sharon, Vermont">Sharon</a>, <a href="/wiki/Vermont.html" title="Vermont">Vermont</a>, the fourth child of <a href="/wiki/Joseph_Smith%2C_Sr..html" title="Joseph Smith, Sr.">Joseph Smith, Sr.</a> and <a href="/wiki/Lucy_Mack_Smith.html" title="Lucy Mack Smith">Lucy Mack Smith</a>. The Smiths were a farming family and several moves in and around <a href="/wiki/New_England.html" title="New England">New England</a> were necessitated by crop failures and some ill-fated business ventures.</p>
<p>During the winter of 1812-1813, when Joseph was eight years old, his leg became dangerously infected. Some doctors advised <a href="/wiki/Amputation.html" title="Amputation">amputation</a>, but his family refused. After a successful operation to remove parts of his affected shin bone (without <a href="/wiki/Anesthesia.html" title="Anesthesia">anesthesia</a> or the commonly used tranquilizer at that time, <a href="/wiki/Whiskey.html" title="Whiskey">whiskey</a>), Smith eventually recovered, though he used crutches for several years and was bothered with a limp for the rest of his life.

<p>In approximately 1816, after three years of crop failures in <a href="/wiki/Norwich%2C_Vermont.html" title="Norwich, Vermont">Norwich, Vermont</a> (the last resulting from the <a href="/wiki/Year_Without_a_Summer.html" title="Year Without a Summer">Year Without a Summer</a>) (<a href="/wiki/Early_life_of_Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr.#CITEREFSmith1853.html" title="Early life of Joseph Smith, Jr.">Smith 1853</a>, p. 66), the Smith family was "warned out of town" (<a href="/wiki/Early_life_of_Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr.#CITEREFNorwich1816.html" title="Early life of Joseph Smith, Jr.">Norwich 1816</a>). Although reasons for this <a href="/wiki/Warning_out_of_town.html" title="Warning out of town">warning out of town</a> are unknown, they could be related to the family's financial difficulties. Alternatively, such warnings were a widespread method in New England for established communities to pressure or coerce "outsiders" to settle elsewhere (<a href="/wiki/Early_life_of_Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr.#CITEREFBenton1911.html" title="Early life of Joseph Smith, Jr.">Benton 1911</a>, pp. 106–113, 115, 117), and the Smith family had recently been moving from town-to-town in Vermont. Joseph Smith, Sr. moved alone to <a href="/wiki/Palmyra_%28town%29%2C_New_York.html" title="Palmyra (town), New York">Palmyra, New York</a>, followed soon by the rest of his family. In Palmyra village, Smith, Sr. and his oldest sons took odd jobs, and opened a "cake and beer shop" (<a href="/wiki/Early_life_of_Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr.#CITEREFTucker1867.html" title="Early life of Joseph Smith, Jr.">Tucker 1867</a>, p. 12). In 1818 the family obtained a mortgage on a 100-acre farm just outside of Palmyra in Manchester (which was part of <a href="/wiki/Farmington%2C_New_York.html" title="Farmington, New York">Farmington</a> until 1821).</p>
<p>The Smith family built a log home, technically just outside their property, in the town of Palmyra (<a href="/wiki/Early_life_of_Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr.#CITEREFBerge1985.html" title="Early life of Joseph Smith, Jr.">Berge 1985</a>). In 1822, the Smiths began building a larger frame house that was actually on their new property (<a href="/wiki/Early_life_of_Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr.#CITEREFSmith1853.html" title="Early life of Joseph Smith, Jr.">Smith 1853</a>, p. 87). On <a href="/wiki/November_19.html" title="November 19">November 19</a>, <a href="/wiki/1823.html" title="1823">1823</a>, Joseph Smith Jr.'s older brother Alvin died, possibly as a result of <a href="/wiki/Mercury%28I%29_chloride.html" title="Mercury(I) chloride">calomel</a> given for "bilious fever" (<a href="/wiki/Early_life_of_Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr.#CITEREFSmith1853.html" title="Early life of Joseph Smith, Jr.">Smith 1853</a>, p. 89). In 1825, the Smiths were unable to raise money for their final mortgage payment, and their creditor foreclosed on the property. However, the family was able to persuade a local <a href="/wiki/Quaker.html" title="Quaker">Quaker</a>, <a  class="new" title="Lemuel Durfee">Lemuel Durfee</a>, to buy the farm and rent the Smiths the property. At the end of 1828, the family moved to another house further south, where they remained until 1830.</p>
<p>Smith had little formal schooling (<a href="/wiki/Early_life_of_Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr.#CITEREFPratt1840.html" title="Early life of Joseph Smith, Jr.">Pratt 1840</a>, p. 3); rather than going to school, he worked on his father's farm, hunted, fished, took odd jobs, and sold cake and beer at Palmyra's public events (<a href="/wiki/Early_life_of_Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr.#CITEREFTucker1867.html" title="Early life of Joseph Smith, Jr.">Tucker 1867</a>, pp. 14-15). His mother described him as "much less inclined to the perusal of books than any of the rest of the children, but far more given to <a href="/wiki/Meditation.html" title="Meditation">meditation</a> and deep study", never having read through the <a href="/wiki/Bible.html" title="Bible">Bible</a> until at least the age of eighteen (<a href="/wiki/Early_life_of_Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr.#CITEREFSmith1853.html" title="Early life of Joseph Smith, Jr.">Smith 1853</a>, p. 84). He was described as "remarkably quiet" (<a href="/wiki/Early_life_of_Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr.#CITEREFSmith1853.html" title="Early life of Joseph Smith, Jr.">Smith 1853</a>, p. 73) and "taciturn" (<a href="/wiki/Early_life_of_Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr.#CITEREFTucker1867.html" title="Early life of Joseph Smith, Jr.">Tucker 1867</a>, p. 16), as well as "proverbially good-natured", but "never known to laugh" (<a href="/wiki/Early_life_of_Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr.#CITEREFTucker1867.html" title="Early life of Joseph Smith, Jr.">Tucker 1867</a>, p. 16–17). He reportedly had an interest and aptitude in debating moral and political issues in a local junior debating club (<a href="/wiki/Early_life_of_Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr.#CITEREFTurner1851.html" title="Early life of Joseph Smith, Jr.">Turner 1851</a>, p. 214).</p>

<h2>Smith's religious background</h2>
<p>Smith was raised during the <a href="/wiki/Second_Great_Awakening.html" title="Second Great Awakening">Second Great Awakening</a>, a time in U.S history when there was a considerable <a href="/wiki/Revivalism.html" title="Revivalism">revival</a> of interest in <a href="/wiki/Christianity.html" title="Christianity">Christianity</a>, in reaction to the more <a href="/wiki/Secularism.html" title="Secularism">secular</a> <a href="/wiki/Age_of_Enlightenment.html" title="Age of Enlightenment">Age of Enlightenment</a> which preceded it. During the Awakening, western New York so frequently "caught fire" with <a href="/wiki/Revivalism.html" title="Revivalism">revivalism</a> that it later became known as the "<a href="/wiki/Burned-over_district.html" title="Burned-over district">Burned-over district</a>".</p>
<p>Smith's family and ancestors, like the majority of families of this era, had little affiliation with organized religion; however, they were privately religious, accepting of things like visions and <a href="/wiki/Prophecy.html" title="Prophecy">prophecies</a>, and they practiced various kinds of <a href="/wiki/Folk_religion.html" title="Folk religion">folk religion</a> (<a href="/wiki/Early_life_of_Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr.#CITEREFQuinn1998.html" title="Early life of Joseph Smith, Jr.">Quinn 1998</a>). Smith's paternal grandfather Asael Smith, a <a href="/wiki/Universal_reconciliation.html" title="Universal reconciliation">Christian universalist</a>, is said to have predicted that one of his descendents would be a prophet (<a href="/wiki/Early_life_of_Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr.#CITEREFRoberts1902.html" title="Early life of Joseph Smith, Jr.">Roberts 1902</a>, p. 2:443). Smith's maternal grandfather Solomon Mack published a book in 1811 describing a series of heavenly visions and voices which he says led to his conversion to the "Christian faith" at the age of seventy-six (<a href="/wiki/Early_life_of_Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr.#CITEREFMack1811.html" title="Early life of Joseph Smith, Jr.">Mack 1811</a>, p. 25).</p>
<p>Smith's parents also claimed to experience visions and prophecy. Before Joseph was born, <a href="/wiki/Lucy_Mack_Smith.html" title="Lucy Mack Smith">Lucy</a>, his mother, went to a grove to pray about <a href="/wiki/Joseph_Smith%2C_Sr..html" title="Joseph Smith, Sr.">her husband's</a> refusal to go to church with her, and when she returned to her home and went to bed, she reportedly had a dream-vision which she interpreted as a <a href="/wiki/Prophecy.html" title="Prophecy">prophecy</a> that Joseph, Sr. would later accept the "pure and undefiled Gospel of the Son of God" (<a href="/wiki/Early_life_of_Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr.#CITEREFSmith1853.html" title="Early life of Joseph Smith, Jr.">Smith 1853</a>, pp. 55-56).</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Joseph_Smith%2C_Sr..html" title="Joseph Smith, Sr.">Joseph Smith, Sr.</a> also reported his own series of seven visions between 1811 and 1819, according to Lucy, five of which she described (<a href="/wiki/Early_life_of_Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr.#CITEREFSmith1853.html" title="Early life of Joseph Smith, Jr.">Smith 1853</a>, pp. 56, 58-59, 70–72, 74). These dreams, Lucy said, came when Joseph, Sr. was "much excited upon the subject of religion", and they confirmed in his mind the correctness of his refusal to join any organized religion, and led him to believe that he would be guided on the proper path to his own <a href="/wiki/Salvation.html" title="Salvation">salvation</a> (<i>id.</i>) The dreams involved an "attendant spirit" (p. 56), and many commentators have noted that his second vision (pp. 58-59) has many similarities to a dream which Smith, Jr. later dictated in the early chapters of the <i>Book of Mormon</i> (<i><a href="/wiki/First_Book_of_Nephi.html" title="First Book of Nephi">First Book of Nephi</a></i> 8:2-28).</p>
<p>Like most Americans at the time (<a href="/wiki/Early_life_of_Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr.#CITEREFQuinn1998.html" title="Early life of Joseph Smith, Jr.">Quinn 1998</a>), the Smith family also practiced various forms of <a href="/wiki/Folk_religion.html" title="Folk religion">folk religion</a>. According to an early Vermont historian, <a href="/wiki/Joseph_Smith%2C_Sr..html" title="Joseph Smith, Sr.">Joseph Smith, Sr.</a> was reportedly a member of a sect of <a href="/wiki/Divining_rod.html" title="Divining rod">divining rodsmen</a> in Vermont known as the "New Israelites" (<a href="/wiki/Early_life_of_Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr.#CITEREFQuinn1998.html" title="Early life of Joseph Smith, Jr.">Quinn 1998</a>, p. 38); however, the evidence to support this claim is very thin. Several other accounts report that Smith, Sr. used a <a href="/wiki/Divining_rod.html" title="Divining rod">divining rod</a> later in Palmyra for seeking treasure (<a href="/wiki/Early_life_of_Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr.#CITEREFQuinn1998.html" title="Early life of Joseph Smith, Jr.">Quinn 1998</a>, p. 38).</p>

<p>Thus, Smith was brought up in a family that believed in prophecy and visions, was skeptical of organized religion, and was open to new religious or folk-religious ideas. He was also exposed to the intense revivalism of his era. During the Second Great Awakening, numerous revivals occurred in many communities in the northern U.S., and were often reported in the <i>Palmyra Register</i>, a local paper read by the Smith family (<a href="/wiki/Early_life_of_Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr.#CITEREFTurner1851.html" title="Early life of Joseph Smith, Jr.">Turner 1851</a>, p. 214). In the Palmyra area itself, the only large multi-denominational revivals were from 1816-1817 and 1824-1825; in the intervening years, however, there were revivals, perhaps on a smaller scale, not in Palmyra itself but nearby. One account, apparently from a local editor of a newspaper in nearby <a href="/wiki/Lyons_%28village%29%2C_New_York.html" title="Lyons (village), New York">Lyons, New York</a>, recalled years later that prior to 1823, there had been "various religious awakenings in the neighborhood" (<a href="/wiki/Early_life_of_Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr.#CITEREFMather1880.html" title="Early life of Joseph Smith, Jr.">Mather 1880</a>, pp. 198–199). Smith himself also made that claim (<a href="/wiki/Early_life_of_Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr.#CITEREFRoberts1902.html" title="Early life of Joseph Smith, Jr.">Roberts 1902</a>). One of Smith's acquaintances stated that the <a href="/wiki/Methodism.html" title="Methodism">Methodists</a> were holding camp meetings "away down in the woods, on the Vienna road" (<a href="/wiki/Early_life_of_Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr.#CITEREFTurner1851.html" title="Early life of Joseph Smith, Jr.">Turner 1851</a>, p. 214). The local Palmyra newspaper also referred to a man who died of intoxication at a Methodist <a href="/wiki/Camp_meeting.html" title="Camp meeting">camp meeting</a> which was held in the town's vicinity in June 1820 (<a href="/wiki/Early_life_of_Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr.#CITEREFBackman1969.html" title="Early life of Joseph Smith, Jr.">Backman 1969</a>, p. 309).</p>
<p>Smith had some interest in the Methodist denomination (<a href="/wiki/Early_life_of_Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr.#CITEREFRoberts1902.html" title="Early life of Joseph Smith, Jr.">Roberts 1902</a>, vol. 1, ch. 1, p. 3). Smith's associate, <a href="/wiki/Oliver_Cowdery.html" title="Oliver Cowdery">Oliver Cowdery</a>, later wrote that Smith was highly influenced by the teachings of a Rev. <a href="/wiki/George_Lane.html" title="George Lane">George Lane</a>, a presiding Methodist <a href="/wiki/Elder_%28religious%29.html" title="Elder (religious)">Elder</a> and an administrator in the Palmyra era during the intense revivals of 1824 and 1825 (<a href="/wiki/Early_life_of_Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr.#CITEREFCowdery1834b.html" title="Early life of Joseph Smith, Jr.">Cowdery 1834b</a>, p. 13); Lane's influence is confirmed by Joseph's brother <a href="/wiki/William_Smith_%28Mormonism%29.html" title="William Smith (Mormonism)">William</a> (<a href="/wiki/Early_life_of_Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr.#CITEREFSmith1883.html" title="Early life of Joseph Smith, Jr.">Smith 1883</a>). It is not known whether or not Smith attended a meeting at which Lane spoke, but Lane visited the nearby town of <a href="/wiki/Phelps_%28town%29%2C_New_York.html" title="Phelps (town), New York">Vienna</a> (15 miles (24 km) from Palmyra) for a large Methodist conference in 1819, and was a leader over the Palmyra area from 1824 to 1825 (<a href="/wiki/Early_life_of_Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr.#CITEREFPorter1969.html" title="Early life of Joseph Smith, Jr.">Porter 1969</a>, p. 330). Smith himself reportedly spoke during some of the local Methodist meetings, and he was described as a "very passable exhorter" (<a href="/wiki/Early_life_of_Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr.#CITEREFTurner1851.html" title="Early life of Joseph Smith, Jr.">Turner 1851</a>, p. 214). However, one of Smith's young acquaintances considered Smith's interpretations of <a href="/wiki/Scripture.html" title="Scripture">Scripture</a> as sometimes "blasphemous" (<a href="/wiki/Early_life_of_Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr.#CITEREFTucker1876.html" title="Early life of Joseph Smith, Jr.">Tucker 1876</a>, p. 18).</p>
<p>However, at some point, Smith reportedly withdrew from the Methodist probationary class in which he was enrolled, announcing that he believed that "all <a href="/wiki/Sectarianism.html" title="Sectarianism">sectarianism</a> was fallacious, and the churches on a false foundation" (<a href="/wiki/Early_life_of_Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr.#CITEREFTucker1876.html" title="Early life of Joseph Smith, Jr.">Tucker 1876</a>, p. 18). According to one recollection years later, Smith "arose and announced that his mission was to restore the true <a href="/wiki/Priesthood.html" title="Priesthood">priesthood</a>. He appointed a number of meetings, but no one seemed inclined to follow him as the leader of a new religion" (<a href="/wiki/Early_life_of_Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr.#CITEREFMather1880.html" title="Early life of Joseph Smith, Jr.">Mather 1880</a>, p. 199). By some time during the intense revivals of 1824-1825, Smith was adamantly refusing to attend any organized church, according to his mother because he claimed, "I can take my Bible, and go into the woods, and learn more in two hours, than you can learn at meeting [sic] in two years, if you should go all the time" (<a href="/wiki/Early_life_of_Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr.#CITEREFSmith1853.html" title="Early life of Joseph Smith, Jr.">Smith 1853</a>, p. 90).</p>

<p>Like his father, the younger Smith reportedly had his own set of visions, the first of which occurred in the early 1820s when Smith was in his early teens and is called by Latter Day Saints the First Vision. The first description of this event was not published until 1832, which said the event occurred in 1821 (<a href="/wiki/Early_life_of_Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr.#CITEREFSmith1832.html" title="Early life of Joseph Smith, Jr.">Smith 1832</a>, p. 3); however, most accounts date the event to the year 1820.<sup id="_ref-date-of-vision_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[2]</a></sup> The First Vision was a <a href="/wiki/Theophany.html" title="Theophany">theophany</a> (a personal and direct communication from <a href="/wiki/God.html" title="God">God</a>), but the details of the theophany have varied as the story was retold throughout Smith's life.</p>
<p>According to Joseph's brother, William, the First Vision was prompted in part by a sermon Smith heard during a <a href="/wiki/Methodism.html" title="Methodism">Methodist</a> revival (<a href="/wiki/Early_life_of_Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr.#CITEREFSmith1883.html" title="Early life of Joseph Smith, Jr.">Smith 1883</a>). The Sermon was given by George Lane, who referred to the <i><a href="/wiki/Epistle_of_James.html" title="Epistle of James">Epistle of James</a></i> 1:5, which in the <a href="/wiki/King_James_Version.html" title="King James Version">King James Version</a> reads, "If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, who giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not, and it shall be given him" (<a href="/wiki/Early_life_of_Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr.#CITEREFSmith1883.html" title="Early life of Joseph Smith, Jr.">Smith 1883</a>). Lane is never recorded as having visited Palmyra until 1824, although he visited the nearby town of <a href="/wiki/Phelps_%28town%29%2C_New_York.html" title="Phelps (town), New York">Vienna</a> (15 miles from Palmyra) in 1819 for a large Methodist conference (<a href="/wiki/Early_life_of_Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr.#CITEREFPorter1969.html" title="Early life of Joseph Smith, Jr.">Porter 1969</a>, p. 330). Joseph and his family could have traveled to sell cake and beer at this event, as they did other events in the Palmyra vicinity, but this is pure speculation (<a href="/wiki/Early_life_of_Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr.#CITEREFAnderson1969.html" title="Early life of Joseph Smith, Jr.">Anderson 1969</a>, p. 7).</p>

</div>
<p>The exact details of the First Vision vary somewhat depending upon who is recounting the story and when. Smith's first account in 1832 dated the vision to 1821 and stated that he saw "a piller [sic] of fire light above the brightness of the sun at noon day", and that "the Lord opened the heavens upon me and I saw the Lord and he spake unto me saying Joseph my son thy sins are forgiven thee" (<a href="/wiki/Early_life_of_Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr.#CITEREFSmith1832.html" title="Early life of Joseph Smith, Jr.">Smith 1832</a>, p. 3). Whether Smith regarded this event as a <i>vision</i> or as an actual <i>visitation</i> by a physical being has been debated, because a <a href="/wiki/Missionary.html" title="Missionary">missionary</a> <a href="/wiki/Tract.html" title="Tract">tract</a> published for Smith's church in 1840 stated that after Smith saw the light, "his mind was caught away, from the natural objects with which he was surrounded; and he was enwrapped in a heavenly vision" (<a href="/wiki/Early_life_of_Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr.#CITEREFPratt1840.html" title="Early life of Joseph Smith, Jr.">Pratt 1840</a>, p. 5).</p>
<p>In an account Smith dictated in 1838 for inclusion in the official church history, he described the First Vision as an appearance of two divine personages sometime during the spring of 1820:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"I saw a pillar of light exactly over my head, above the brightness of the sun, which descended gradually until it fell upon me…When the light rested upon me I saw two Personages, whose brightness and glory defy all description, standing above me in the air. One of them spake unto me, calling me by name, and said, pointing to the other, 'This is my Beloved Son. Hear Him!'" (<a href="/wiki/Early_life_of_Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr.#CITEREFRoberts1902.html" title="Early life of Joseph Smith, Jr.">Roberts 1902</a>, vol. 1, ch. 1, p. 5).</dd>
</dl>
<p>It is unclear who, if anyone, Smith told about his vision prior to his purported discovery of the Golden Plates in 1823. According to Smith, he told his mother at the time that he had "learned for [him]self that <a href="/wiki/Presbyterian.html" title="Presbyterian">Presbyterianism</a> is not true" (<a href="/wiki/Early_life_of_Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr.#CITEREFRoberts1902.html" title="Early life of Joseph Smith, Jr.">Roberts 1902</a>, vol. 1, ch. 1, p. 5); however, mention of this conversation is omitted from Lucy's own history (<a href="/wiki/Early_life_of_Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr.#CITEREFSmith1853.html" title="Early life of Joseph Smith, Jr.">Smith 1853</a>, p. 77), and Joseph never stated that he described the details of the vision to his family in 1820 or soon thereafter. He <i>did</i> claim that he spoke about the vision with "one of the Methodist preachers, who was very active in the before-mentioned religious excitement" (<a href="/wiki/Early_life_of_Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr.#CITEREFRoberts1902.html" title="Early life of Joseph Smith, Jr.">Roberts 1902</a>, vol. 1, ch. 1, p. 6). Many have presumed this to be the Rev. Lane, but there is no record of Lane visiting the Palmyra vicinity in 1820. Joseph's brother William was apparently unaware of any visions until 1823 (<a href="/wiki/Early_life_of_Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr.#CITEREFSmith1883.html" title="Early life of Joseph Smith, Jr.">Smith 1883</a>, pp. 8–9), although he would have only been nine years old in 1820.</p>
<p>Smith claimed that the retelling of his vision story "excited a great deal of prejudice against me among professors of religion, and was the cause of great persecution, which continued to increase" (<a href="/wiki/Early_life_of_Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr.#CITEREFRoberts1902.html" title="Early life of Joseph Smith, Jr.">Roberts 1902</a>, vol. 1, ch. 1, p. 6). Tales of visions and <a href="/wiki/Theophany.html" title="Theophany">theophanies</a>, however, were not unusual at the time, though the clergy of many organized religions often resisted the stories (<a href="/wiki/Early_life_of_Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr.#CITEREFQuinn1998.html" title="Early life of Joseph Smith, Jr.">Quinn 1998</a>). Early prejudice against Smith may have taken place by clergy, but there is no contemporary record of this. The bulk of Smith's persecution seems to have arisen among laity, and not because of his First Vision, but because of his later claim to have discovered the Golden Plates in a hill near his home; the claim was widely publicized and ridiculed in local newspapers beginning around 1827.</p>
<p>Years later, one non-Mormon neighbor summed up views of Smith and his family by their Palmyra neighbors by saying, "To tell the truth, there was something about him they could not understand; some way he knew more than they did, and it made them mad" (<a href="/wiki/Early_life_of_Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr.#CITEREFCobb1881.html" title="Early life of Joseph Smith, Jr.">Cobb 1881</a>).</p>

<p>At about the same time as Smith reportedly had his First Vision, it has been said that he began to practice <a href="/wiki/Crystal_gazing.html" title="Crystal gazing">crystal gazing</a>, a form of <a href="/wiki/Divination.html" title="Divination">divination</a> in which a "<a href="/wiki/Seer.html" title="Seer">seer</a>" looks into a crystal, often called a <a href="/wiki/Seer_stone.html" title="Seer stone">seer stone</a>, to divine <a href="/wiki/Esoteric.html" title="Esoteric">esoteric</a> knowledge. There are two stories about how Smith obtained his first <a href="/wiki/Seer_stone.html" title="Seer stone">seer stone</a>. According to an account of an interview with Smith, Sr., a 14-year-old Joseph borrowed the stone from a person working as a local crystal gazer (<a href="/wiki/Early_life_of_Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr.#CITEREFLapham1870.html" title="Early life of Joseph Smith, Jr.">Lapham 1870</a>, pp. 305-306); it reportedly showed him the underground location of his own stone near his home, which he located at a depth of about twenty-two feet (<i>Id.</i>)</p>
<p>According to another story, in either 1819 (<a href="/wiki/Early_life_of_Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr.#CITEREFTucker1867.html" title="Early life of Joseph Smith, Jr.">Tucker 1867</a>, p. 19) or 1822 (<a href="/wiki/Early_life_of_Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr.#CITEREFHowe1834.html" title="Early life of Joseph Smith, Jr.">Howe 1834</a>, p. 240), while the older Smith males were digging a well for <a  class="new" title="Clark Chase">Clark Chase</a>, a Palmyra neighbor, at a depth of more than twenty feet they reportedly found an unusual stone (<a href="/wiki/Early_life_of_Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr.#CITEREFTiffany1859.html" title="Early life of Joseph Smith, Jr.">Tiffany 1859</a>, p. 163). This stone was described as either white and glassy, shaped like a child's foot (<a href="/wiki/Early_life_of_Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr.#CITEREFTucker1867.html" title="Early life of Joseph Smith, Jr.">Tucker 1867</a>, p. 19), or "chocolate-colored, somewhat egg-shaped" (<a href="/wiki/Early_life_of_Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr.#CITEREFRoberts1930.html" title="Early life of Joseph Smith, Jr.">Roberts 1930</a>, 1:129). Fascinated, Smith reportedly took this stone and later began to see things inside it <a href="/wiki/Clairvoyance.html" title="Clairvoyance">clairvoyantly</a> (<a href="/wiki/Early_life_of_Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr.#CITEREFTucker1867.html" title="Early life of Joseph Smith, Jr.">Tucker 1867</a>, p. 20). Some scholars have concluded that these two accounts refer to two distinct stones found in 1819-1820 and 1822, and that these stories have in some cases been conflated (<a href="/wiki/Early_life_of_Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr.#CITEREFQuinn1998.html" title="Early life of Joseph Smith, Jr.">Quinn 1998</a>). Other scholars believe that the two accounts refer to the same event in 1822 (<a href="/wiki/Early_life_of_Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr.#CITEREFVogel1994.html" title="Early life of Joseph Smith, Jr.">Vogel 1994</a>, p. 202). However, this has little support among his current followers.</p>
<p>In any case, about 1825, Smith was approached by a man named <a  class="new" title="Josiah Stowell">Josiah Stowell</a>, from <a href="/wiki/Bainbridge_%28town%29%2C_New_York.html" title="Bainbridge (town), New York">South Bainbridge, New York</a>, who had been searching for a lost Spanish mine near <a href="/wiki/Harmony%2C_Pennsylvania.html" title="Harmony, Pennsylvania">Harmony</a>, <a href="/wiki/Pennsylvania.html" title="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a> (<a href="/wiki/Early_life_of_Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr.#CITEREFSmith1853.html" title="Early life of Joseph Smith, Jr.">Smith 1853</a>, p. 91). He had traveled to Manchester because of Smith's reputation as "possess[ing] certain keys<sup id="_ref-keys_note_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[3]</a></sup>, by which he could discern things invisible to the natural eye" (<a href="/wiki/Early_life_of_Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr.#CITEREFSmith1853.html" title="Early life of Joseph Smith, Jr.">Smith 1853</a>, p. 92), and Stowell wanted to employ his services. Stowell was working with a <a href="/wiki/William_Hale.html" title="William Hale">William Hale</a>, also from Harmony, who reportedly had learned from a <a href="/wiki/Crystal_gazing.html" title="Crystal gazing">crystal gazer</a> named Odle of treasures supposedly concealed in a hill near Hale's home (<a href="/wiki/Early_life_of_Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr.#CITEREFLewisLewis1879.html" title="Early life of Joseph Smith, Jr.">Lewis &amp; Lewis 1879</a>).</p>
<p>Smith agreed to take the job of assisting Stowell and Hale, and he and his father worked with the Stowell-Hale team for approximately one month, attempting, according to their contract, to locate "a valuable mine of either Gold or Silver and also...coined money and bars or ingots of Gold or Silver" (<a href="/wiki/Early_life_of_Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr.#CITEREFWade1880.html" title="Early life of Joseph Smith, Jr.">Wade 1880</a>). Smith boarded with an <a href="/wiki/Isaac_Hale.html" title="Isaac Hale">Isaac Hale</a> (a relative of William Hale), and fell in love with Isaac Hale's daughter <a href="/wiki/Emma_Hale_Smith.html" title="Emma Hale Smith">Emma</a>, a schoolteacher he would later marry in 1827. Isaac Hale, however, disapproved of their relationship and of Smith in general. According to an unsupported account by Hale, Smith attempted to locate the mine by burying his face in a hat containing the <a href="/wiki/Seer_stone.html" title="Seer stone">seer stone</a>; however, as the treasure seekers got close to their objective, Smith claimed that an enchantment became so strong that Smith could no longer see it. (<a href="/wiki/Early_life_of_Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr.#CITEREFHowe1834.html" title="Early life of Joseph Smith, Jr.">Howe 1834</a>, pp. 262–266).

<p>Court records from <a href="/wiki/Bainbridge_%28town%29%2C_New_York.html" title="Bainbridge (town), New York">Bainbridge, New York</a>, show that Smith, identified as "The Glass Looker," was before the court on <a href="/wiki/March_20.html" title="March 20">March 20</a>, <a href="/wiki/1826.html" title="1826">1826</a> on a <a href="/wiki/Warrant_%28law%29.html" title="Warrant (law)">warrant</a> for an unspecified <a href="/wiki/Misdemeanor.html" title="Misdemeanor">misdemeanor</a> charge (<a href="/wiki/Early_life_of_Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr.#CITEREFHill1972.html" title="Early life of Joseph Smith, Jr.">Hill 1972</a>, p. 2), and that the judge issued a <i><a href="/wiki/Mittimus.html" title="Mittimus">mittimus</a></i> for Smith to be held, either during or after the proceedings (<a href="/wiki/Early_life_of_Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr.#CITEREFHill1972.html" title="Early life of Joseph Smith, Jr.">Hill 1972</a>, p. 5). Although Smith's associate <a href="/wiki/Oliver_Cowdery.html" title="Oliver Cowdery">Oliver Cowdery</a> (who had not met Smith as of 1826) later claimed that Smith was "honorably acquitted" (<a href="/wiki/Early_life_of_Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr.#CITEREFCowdery1835.html" title="Early life of Joseph Smith, Jr.">Cowdery 1835</a>, p. 200), the result of the proceeding is unclear, with some eye-witnesses (including the court reporter) claiming he was found guilty, others claiming he was "condemned" but "designedly allowed to escape," and yet others claiming he was "discharged" for lack of evidence (<a href="/wiki/Early_life_of_Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr.#CITEREFHill1972.html" title="Early life of Joseph Smith, Jr.">Hill 1972</a>, p. 5). At the examination, seven witnesses were called, including Smith himself, and most of them affirmed that Smith had some sort of spiritual gift.</p>
<p>By November 1826, Josiah Stowell could no longer afford to continue searching for buried treasure; Smith traveled to <a href="/wiki/Colesville%2C_New_York.html" title="Colesville, New York">Colesville, New York</a> for a few months to work for <a href="/wiki/Joseph_Knight.html" title="Joseph Knight">Joseph Knight</a> (<a href="/wiki/Early_life_of_Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr.#CITEREFJesee1984.html" title="Early life of Joseph Smith, Jr.">Jesee 1984</a>, p. 32), one of Stowell's friends. There are reports that Smith directed further excavations on Knight's property and at other locations around Colesville (<a href="/wiki/Early_life_of_Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr.#CITEREFVogel1994.html" title="Early life of Joseph Smith, Jr.">Vogel 1994</a>, pp. 227, 229). Smith himself later commented his working as a treasure seeker: "'Was not Joseph Smith a money digger?' Yes, but it was never a very profitable job for him, as he only got fourteen dollars a month for it." (<a href="/wiki/Early_life_of_Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr.#CITEREFSmith1976.html" title="Early life of Joseph Smith, Jr.">Smith 1976</a>, p. 120)</p>
<p>Because Smith had been unable to gain Isaac Hale's approval, he and <a href="/wiki/Emma_Hale_Smith.html" title="Emma Hale Smith">Emma Hale Smith</a> <a href="/wiki/Elope.html" title="Elope">eloped</a> to <a href="/wiki/Bainbridge_%28town%29%2C_New_York.html" title="Bainbridge (town), New York">South Bainbridge</a> on <a href="/wiki/January_18.html" title="January 18">January 18</a>, <a href="/wiki/1827.html" title="1827">1827</a>.

<p>Owing to my continuing to assert that I had seen a vision, persecution still followed me, and my wife’s father’s family were very much opposed to our being married. I was, therefore, under the necessity of taking her elsewhere; so we went and were married at the house of Squire Tarbill, in South Bainbridge, Chenango county, New York. Immediately after my marriage, I left Mr. Stoal’s, and went to my father’s, and farmed with him that season. (Joseph Smith <a  class="extiw" title="s:Pearl_of_Great_Price/History">History:58</a>)</p>

<p>The words <i><a href="/wiki/Urim_and_Thummim.html" title="Urim and Thummim">Urim and Thummim</a></i> derive from passages in the <a href="/wiki/Old_Testament.html" title="Old Testament">Old Testament</a> which describe the use of "the Urim and the Thummim" as a means for <a href="/wiki/Divination.html" title="Divination">divination</a> by <a href="/wiki/Israelite.html" title="Israelite">Israelite</a> <a href="/wiki/Priest.html" title="Priest">priests</a> (see, e.g., <i><a href="/wiki/Book_of_Exodus.html" title="Book of Exodus">Book of Exodus</a></i> 28:30). In Smith's view, the <i>Urim and Thummim</i> operated much like the <a href="/wiki/Seer_stone.html" title="Seer stone">seer stones</a> with which he had much prior experience, and observers reported that Smith eventually used the <i>Urim and Thummim</i> and his seer stone interchangeably.

<p>Thus, on <a href="/wiki/September_22.html" title="September 22">September 22</a>, <a href="/wiki/1823.html" title="1823">1823</a>, a day listed in local <a href="/wiki/Almanac.html" title="Almanac">almanacs</a> as the <a href="/wiki/Autumn_equinox.html" title="Autumn equinox">autumn equinox</a>, Smith claims that he went to a <a href="/wiki/Cumorah.html" title="Cumorah">prominent hill</a> near his home, and found the location of the artifacts (<a href="/wiki/Early_life_of_Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr.#CITEREFRoberts1902.html" title="Early life of Joseph Smith, Jr.">Roberts 1902</a>, vol. 1, ch. 2, p. 15). There are varying accounts as to how the angel reportedly directed Smith to the location of the Golden Plates. Smith himself later claimed that this location was shown to him in a vision while he conversed with Moroni (<a href="/wiki/Early_life_of_Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr.#CITEREFRoberts1902.html" title="Early life of Joseph Smith, Jr.">Roberts 1902</a>, vol. 1, ch. 2, p. 13). This conforms to an account by Smith's friend Joseph Knight (<a href="/wiki/Early_life_of_Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr.#CITEREFJesee1976.html" title="Early life of Joseph Smith, Jr.">Jesee 1976</a>, p. 2). However, according to an account by another friend <a href="/wiki/Martin_Harris.html" title="Martin Harris">Martin Harris</a>, Smith discovered the location of the Golden Plates through the use of the <a href="/wiki/Seer_stone.html" title="Seer stone">seer stone</a> he had used to seek treasure as part of the Stowell-Hale team in 1825 (<a href="/wiki/Early_life_of_Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr.#CITEREFTiffany1859.html" title="Early life of Joseph Smith, Jr.">Tiffany 1859</a>, p. 163). In yet another account, the angel required Smith to follow a sequence of landmarks until he arrived at the correct location (<a href="/wiki/Early_life_of_Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr.#CITEREFLapham1870.html" title="Early life of Joseph Smith, Jr.">Lapham 1870</a>, p. 305).</p>
<p>The plates, according to Smith, were inside a covered stone box. However, Smith stated he was unable to obtain the plates at his first visit. According to an account by Willard Chase, the angel gave Smith a strict set of "commandments" which he was to follow in order to obtain the plates. Among these requirements, according to Chase, was that Smith must approach the site "dressed in black clothes, and riding a black horse with a switch tail, and demand the book in a certain name, and after obtaining it, he must go directly away, and neither lay it down nor look behind him" (<a href="/wiki/Early_life_of_Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr.#CITEREFHowe1834.html" title="Early life of Joseph Smith, Jr.">Howe 1834</a>, p. 242). According to <a href="/wiki/Lucy_Mack_Smith.html" title="Lucy Mack Smith">Smith's mother</a>, the angel forbade him to put the plates on the ground until they were under lock and key (<a href="/wiki/Early_life_of_Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr.#CITEREFSmith1853.html" title="Early life of Joseph Smith, Jr.">Smith 1853</a>, pp. 85–86). He was, however, according to a retelling of an account by Smith, Sr., allowed to put down the plates on a napkin he was to bring with him for that purpose (<a href="/wiki/Early_life_of_Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr.#CITEREFLapham1870.html" title="Early life of Joseph Smith, Jr.">Lapham 1870</a>, pp. 305–306).</p>
<p>When Smith arrived at the place where the plates were supposed to be, he reportedly took the plates from the stone box they were in and set them down on the ground nearby, looking to see if there were other items in the box that would "be of some pecuniary advantage to him" (<a href="/wiki/Early_life_of_Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr.#CITEREFSmith1853.html" title="Early life of Joseph Smith, Jr.">Smith 1853</a>, p. 85). When he turned around, however, the plates were said to have disappeared into the box, which was then closed (<a href="/wiki/Early_life_of_Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr.#CITEREFJessee1976.html" title="Early life of Joseph Smith, Jr.">Jessee 1976</a>, p. 2). When Smith attempted to get the plates back out of the box, William Chase's testimony of a conversation he had with Joseph Smith, Sr. claims that Joseph Smith, Jr. saw a <a href="/wiki/Toad.html" title="Toad">toad</a> that grew into the form of the angel (<a href="/wiki/Early_life_of_Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr.#CITEREFHowe1834.html" title="Early life of Joseph Smith, Jr.">Howe 1834</a>, p. 242), and hurled him back to the ground with a violent force (<i>id.</i>); (<a href="/wiki/Early_life_of_Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr.#CITEREFSmith1853.html" title="Early life of Joseph Smith, Jr.">Smith 1853</a>, p. 86); (<a href="/wiki/Early_life_of_Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr.#CITEREFLapham1870.html" title="Early life of Joseph Smith, Jr.">Lapham 1870</a>, p. 305). After three failed attempts to retrieve the plates (<a href="/wiki/Early_life_of_Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr.#CITEREFSmith1832.html" title="Early life of Joseph Smith, Jr.">Smith 1832</a>, p. 3), the angel purportedly told him that he could not have the plates then, because he "had been tempted of the advisary [<i>sic</i>] and saught [<i>sic</i>] the Plates to obtain riches and kept not the commandments that I should have" (<a href="/wiki/Early_life_of_Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr.#CITEREFSmith1832.html" title="Early life of Joseph Smith, Jr.">Smith 1832</a>, p. 3).</p>
<p>Thus, Smith claimed the angel directed him to return the next year on <a href="/wiki/September_22.html" title="September 22">September 22</a>, <a href="/wiki/1824.html" title="1824">1824</a>, with the "right person", whom the angel reportedly said was his brother Alvin (<a href="/wiki/Early_life_of_Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr.#CITEREFJessee1976.html" title="Early life of Joseph Smith, Jr.">Jessee 1976</a>, p. 2). However, Alvin died within a few months, and when Smith returned to the hill in 1824, he did not return with the plates. Once again, the angel reportedly told Smith that he must return the next year with the "right person", the identity of whom the angel would not say (<a href="/wiki/Early_life_of_Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr.#CITEREFJessee1976.html" title="Early life of Joseph Smith, Jr.">Jessee 1976</a>, p. 2). According to Smith's associate Willard Chase, Smith originally thought this person was to be <a  class="new" title="Samuel T. Lawrence">Samuel T. Lawrence</a>, a <a href="/wiki/Seer.html" title="Seer">seer</a> himself who worked in Smith's treasure-seeking company in Palmyra (<a href="/wiki/Early_life_of_Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr.#CITEREFTiffany1859.html" title="Early life of Joseph Smith, Jr.">Tiffany 1859</a>, p. 164), and therefore Smith reportedly took Lawrence to the hill in 1825 (<a href="/wiki/Early_life_of_Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr.#CITEREFHowe1834.html" title="Early life of Joseph Smith, Jr.">Howe 1834</a>, p. 243). At Lawrence's prompting, Smith reportedly ascertained through his <a href="/wiki/Seer_stone.html" title="Seer stone">seer stone</a> that there was an additional item together with the plates in the box, which Smith later called the <i>Urim and Thummim</i> (<a href="/wiki/Early_life_of_Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr.#CITEREFHowe1834.html" title="Early life of Joseph Smith, Jr.">Howe 1834</a>, p. 243). Smith also reportedly discovered at some point that the box, or the ground nearby, contained at least two more <i>Book of Mormon</i> artifacts, the <a href="/wiki/Liahona.html" title="Liahona">Liahona</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Sword_of_Laban.html" title="Sword of Laban">sword of Laban</a> (<a href="/wiki/Early_life_of_Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr.#CITEREFLapham1870.html" title="Early life of Joseph Smith, Jr.">Lapham 1870</a>, p. 306). However, Lawrence was apparently not the "right person", because Smith did not obtain the plates in his 1825 visit.</p>
<p>Later, Smith reportedly determined by looking into his <a href="/wiki/Seer_stone.html" title="Seer stone">seer stone</a> that the "right person" was <a href="/wiki/Emma_Hale_Smith.html" title="Emma Hale Smith">Emma Hale Smith</a>, his future wife (<a href="/wiki/Early_life_of_Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr.#CITEREFJessee1976.html" title="Early life of Joseph Smith, Jr.">Jessee 1976</a>, p. 2). There is no specific record of Smith seeing the angel in 1826, however, after Joseph and Emma were married on <a href="/wiki/January_18.html" title="January 18">January 18</a>, <a href="/wiki/1827.html" title="1827">1827</a>, Smith returned to Manchester, and as he passed by <a href="/wiki/Cumorah.html" title="Cumorah">Cumorah</a>, he was purportedly chastised by the angel for not being "engaged enough in the work of the Lord" (<a href="/wiki/Early_life_of_Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr.#CITEREFSmith1853.html" title="Early life of Joseph Smith, Jr.">Smith 1853</a>, p. 99).

<p>Just days prior to the day Smith said he was to meet with the angel on <a href="/wiki/September_22.html" title="September 22">September 22</a>, <a href="/wiki/1827.html" title="1827">1827</a>, Smith's treasure-seeking associates Josiah Stowell and Joseph Knight arranged to be in Palmyra for the attempt to retrieve the plates (<a href="/wiki/Early_life_of_Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr.#CITEREFJessee1976.html" title="Early life of Joseph Smith, Jr.">Jessee 1976</a>, p. 3); (<a href="/wiki/Early_life_of_Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr.#CITEREFSmith1853.html" title="Early life of Joseph Smith, Jr.">Smith 1853</a>, p. 99). Because Smith was concerned that Samuel Lawrence, his earlier confidant, might interfere, Smith sent <a href="/wiki/Joseph_Smith%2C_Sr..html" title="Joseph Smith, Sr.">his father</a> to spy on Lawrence's house the night of <a href="/wiki/September_21.html" title="September 21">September 21</a> until dark (<a href="/wiki/Early_life_of_Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr.#CITEREFJessee1976.html" title="Early life of Joseph Smith, Jr.">Jessee 1976</a>, p. 3). Late that night, Smith took the horse and carriage of Joseph Knight to <a href="/wiki/Cumorah.html" title="Cumorah">Cumorah</a> with his wife Emma (<a href="/wiki/Early_life_of_Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr.#CITEREFSmith1853.html" title="Early life of Joseph Smith, Jr.">Smith 1853</a>, p. 100). Leaving Emma in the wagon, where she knelt in prayer (<a href="/wiki/Early_life_of_Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr.#CITEREFTiffany1853.html" title="Early life of Joseph Smith, Jr.">Tiffany 1853</a>, p. 164), he reportedly walked to the site of the Golden Plates, retrieved them, and hid them in a fallen tree-top on or near the hill (<a href="/wiki/Early_life_of_Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr.#CITEREFHowe1976.html" title="Early life of Joseph Smith, Jr.">Howe 1976</a>, p. 246); (<a href="/wiki/Early_life_of_Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr.#CITEREFTiffany1859.html" title="Early life of Joseph Smith, Jr.">Tiffany 1859</a>, p. 165). He also reportedly retrieved the <i>Urim and Thummim</i>, which he showed to <a href="/wiki/Lucy_Mack_Smith.html" title="Lucy Mack Smith">his mother</a> the next morning (<a href="/wiki/Early_life_of_Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr.#CITEREFSmith1853.html" title="Early life of Joseph Smith, Jr.">Smith 1853</a>, p. 101).</p>
<p>Over the next few days, Smith took a well-digging job in nearby <a href="/wiki/Macedon_%28town%29%2C_New_York.html" title="Macedon (town), New York">Macedon</a> to obtain money to buy a solid lockable chest in which he said he would put the plates (<a href="/wiki/Early_life_of_Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr.#CITEREFSmith1853.html" title="Early life of Joseph Smith, Jr.">Smith 1853</a>, p. 101). By then, however, some of Smith's treasure-seeking company had heard that Smith was successful in obtaining the plates, and they wanted what they believed was their cut of the profits from what they saw as part of their joint venture (<a href="/wiki/Early_life_of_Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr.#CITEREFTiffany1859.html" title="Early life of Joseph Smith, Jr.">Tiffany 1859</a>, p. 167). Spying once again on the house of Samuel Lawrence, Smith, Sr. determined that a group of ten–twelve of these men, including Lawrence and Willard Chase, had enlisted the talents of a renowned and supposedly-talented seer from sixty miles away, in an effort to locate where the plates were hidden by means of <a href="/wiki/Divination.html" title="Divination">divination</a> (<a href="/wiki/Early_life_of_Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr.#CITEREFSmith1853.html" title="Early life of Joseph Smith, Jr.">Smith 1853</a>, p. 102). When Emma heard of this, she went to Macedon and informed Smith, Jr., who reportedly determined through his <i>Urim and Thummim</i> that the plates were safe, but nevertheless he hurriedly traveled home by horseback (<a href="/wiki/Early_life_of_Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr.#CITEREFSmith1853.html" title="Early life of Joseph Smith, Jr.">Smith 1853</a>, pp. 103–104). Once home in Palmyra, he then walked to <a href="/wiki/Cumorah.html" title="Cumorah">Cumorah</a> and reportedly removed the plates from their hiding place, fending off attackers on his walk back home, with the plates said to be under his arm wrapped in a linen frock (<a href="/wiki/Early_life_of_Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr.#CITEREFHowe1834.html" title="Early life of Joseph Smith, Jr.">Howe 1834</a>, p. 246); (<a href="/wiki/Early_life_of_Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr.#CITEREFSmith1853.html" title="Early life of Joseph Smith, Jr.">Smith 1853</a>, pp. 104–105); (<a href="/wiki/Early_life_of_Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr.#CITEREFTiffany1859.html" title="Early life of Joseph Smith, Jr.">Tiffany 1859</a>, p. 166).</p>
<p>According to Smith, the plates "had the appearance of gold", and were:</p>

<p>However, Smith claimed that the angel commanded him not to allow any person other than himself to see the plates, including his family. At first, he reportedly kept the plates in a chest under the hearth in his parents' home (<a href="/wiki/Early_life_of_Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr.#CITEREFSmith1853.html" title="Early life of Joseph Smith, Jr.">Smith 1853</a>). Fearing they might be discovered, however, Smith reportedly hid the chest under the floor boards of his parents' old log home nearby (<a href="/wiki/Early_life_of_Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr.#CITEREFTiffany1859.html" title="Early life of Joseph Smith, Jr.">Tiffany 1859</a>). Later, he reportedly took the plates out of the chest, left the empty chest under the floor boards, and hid the plates in a barrel of flax, not long before the location of the empty box was discovered and the place ransacked by Smith's former treasure-seeking associates, who had enlisted one of the men's sisters to find that location by looking in her <a href="/wiki/Seer_stone.html" title="Seer stone">seer stone</a> (<a href="/wiki/Early_life_of_Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr.#CITEREFSmith1853.html" title="Early life of Joseph Smith, Jr.">Smith 1853</a>, pp. 107–109).</p>

<h2>Moving to Harmony, Pennsylvania</h2>
<p>Once Smith had the purported Golden Plates, temporarily kept safe from his Palmyra neighbors, his focus turned to getting the engravings on them translated. To do so, however, he needed money, and at the time he was penniless (<a href="/wiki/Early_life_of_Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr.#CITEREFSmith1853.html" title="Early life of Joseph Smith, Jr.">Smith 1853</a>). Therefore, Smith sent <a href="/wiki/Lucy_Mack_Smith.html" title="Lucy Mack Smith">his mother</a> (<a href="/wiki/Early_life_of_Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr.#CITEREFSmith1853.html" title="Early life of Joseph Smith, Jr.">Smith 1853</a>, p. 110) to the home of <a href="/wiki/Martin_Harris.html" title="Martin Harris">Martin Harris</a>, a local landowner said at the time to be worth about $8,000 to $10,000 (<a href="/wiki/Early_life_of_Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr.#CITEREFHowe1834.html" title="Early life of Joseph Smith, Jr.">Howe 1834</a>, p. 260).</p>
<p>Harris had apparently been a close confidant of the Smith family since at least 1826 (<a href="/wiki/Early_life_of_Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr.#CITEREFHowe1834.html" title="Early life of Joseph Smith, Jr.">Howe 1834</a>, pp. 255), and he may have heard about Smith's attempts to obtain the plates from the angel even earlier from Smith, Sr. (<a href="/wiki/Early_life_of_Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr.#CITEREFSmith1853.html" title="Early life of Joseph Smith, Jr.">Smith 1853</a>, p. 109). He was also a believer in Smith's powers with his <a href="/wiki/Seer_stone.html" title="Seer stone">seer stone</a> (<a href="/wiki/Early_life_of_Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr.#CITEREFTiffany1859.html" title="Early life of Joseph Smith, Jr.">Tiffany 1859</a>, p. 164). When Lucy visited Harris, he had heard about Smith's claim to have found Golden Plates through the grapevine in Palmyra, and was interested in finding out more (<a href="/wiki/Early_life_of_Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr.#CITEREFTiffany1859.html" title="Early life of Joseph Smith, Jr.">Tiffany 1859</a>, pp. 167–168). Thus, at Lucy Smith's request, Harris went to the Smith home, heard the story from Smith, and hefted a glass box that Smith said contained the plates (<a href="/wiki/Early_life_of_Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr.#CITEREFTiffany1859.html" title="Early life of Joseph Smith, Jr.">Tiffany 1859</a>, pp. 168–169). Smith convinced Harris that he had the plates, and that the angel had told him to "quit the company of the money-diggers" (<a href="/wiki/Early_life_of_Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr.#CITEREFTiffany1859.html" title="Early life of Joseph Smith, Jr.">Tiffany 1859</a>, p. 169). Convinced, Harris immediately gave Smith $50, and committed to sponsor the translation of the plates (<a href="/wiki/Early_life_of_Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr.#CITEREFSmith1853.html" title="Early life of Joseph Smith, Jr.">Smith 1853</a>, p. 113).</p>
<p>The money provided by Harris was enough to pay all of Smith's debts in Palmyra, and for him to travel with Emma and all of their belongings to <a href="/wiki/Harmony%2C_Pennsylvania.html" title="Harmony, Pennsylvania">Harmony</a>, <a href="/wiki/Pennsylvania.html" title="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a>, where they would be able to avoid the public commotion in Palmyra over the plates. (<a href="/wiki/Early_life_of_Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr.#CITEREFTiffany1859.html" title="Early life of Joseph Smith, Jr.">Tiffany 1859</a>, p. 170). Thus, in early October 1827, they moved to Harmony, with the glass box purportedly holding the plates hidden during the trip in a barrel of beans (<a href="/wiki/Early_life_of_Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr.#CITEREFTiffany1859.html" title="Early life of Joseph Smith, Jr.">Tiffany 1859</a>, p. 170).</p>

<h2>Notes</h2>
<ol class="references">
<li id="_note-leg-surgery"><b><a  title="">^</a></b> Joseph's mother gives the following account:
<blockquote class="toccolours" style="float:none; padding: 10px 15px 10px 15px;">
<p>At the end of three weeks, we thought it advisable to send again for the surgeon. When he came he made an incision of eight inches, on the front side of the leg, between the knee and ankle. This relieved the pain in a great measure, and the patient was quite comfortable until the wound began to heal, when the pain became as violent as ever.<br />
The surgeon was called again, and he this time enlarged the wound, cutting the leg even to the bone. It commenced healing the second time, and as soon as it began to heal it also began to swell again, which swelling continued to rise till we deemed it wisdom to call a council of surgeons; and when they met in consultation they decided that amputation was the only remedy.<br />
Soon after coming to this conclusion, they rode up to the door and were invited into a room apart from the one in which Joseph lay. They being seated, I addressed them thus: "Gentlemen, what can you do to save my boy's leg?" They answered, "We can do nothing; we have cut it open to the bone and find it so affected that we consider his leg incurable and that amputation is absolutely necessary in order to save his life."<br />
This was like a thunderbolt to me. I appealed to the principal surgeon, saying, "Dr. Stone, can you not make another trial? Can you not, by cutting around the bone, take out the diseased part, and perhaps that which is sound will heal over, and by this means you will save his leg? You will not, you must not, take off his leg, until you try once more. I will not consent to let you enter his room until you make me this promise."<br />
After consulting a short time with each other, they agreed to do as I had requested, then went to see my suffering son. One of the doctors, on approaching his bed, said, "My poor boy, we have come again." "Yes," said Joseph, "I see you have; but you have not come to take off my leg, have you, sir?" "No," replied the surgeon, "it is your mother's request that we make one more effort, and that is what we have now come for."<br />
The principal surgeon, after a moment's conversation, ordered cords to be brought to bind Joseph fast to a bedstead; but to this Joseph objected. The doctor, however, insisted that he must be confined, upon which Joseph said very decidedly, "No, doctor, I will not be bound, for I can bear the operation much better if I have my liberty." "Then," said Dr. Stone, "will you drink some brandy?"<br />
"No," said Joseph, "not one drop."<br />
"Will you take some wine?" rejoined the doctor. "You must take something, or you can never endure the severe operation to which you must be subjected."<br />
"No," exclaimed Joseph, "I will not touch one particle of liquor, neither will I be tied down; but I will tell you what I will do - I will have my father sit on the bed and hold me in his arms, and then I will do whatever is necessary in order to have the bone taken out." Looking at me, he said, "Mother, I want you to leave the room, for I know you cannot bear to see me suffer so; father can stand it, but you have carried me so much, and watched over me so long, you are almost worn out." Then looking up into my face, his eyes swimming in tears, he continued. "Now, mother, promise me that you will not stay, will you? The Lord will help me, and I shall get through with it."<br />
To this request I consented, and getting a number of folded sheets, and laying them under his leg, I retired, going several hundred yards from the house in order to be out of hearing.<br />
The surgeons commenced operating by boring into the bone of his leg, first on one side of the bone where is was affected, then on the other side, after which they broke it off with a pair of forceps or pincers. They thus took away large pieces of the bone. When they broke off the first piece, Joseph screamed out so loudly, that I could not forbear running to him. On my entering the room, he cried out, "Oh, mother, go back, go back; I do not want you to come in - I will try to tough it out, if you will go away."<br />
When the third piece was taken away, I burst into the room again-and oh, my God! what a spectacle for a mother's eye! The wound torn open, the blood still gushing from it, and the bed literally covered with blood. Joseph was pale as a corpse, and large drops of sweat were rolling down his face, whilst upon every feature was depicted the utmost agony!<br />
I was immediately forced from the room, and detained until the operation was completed; but when the act was accomplished, Joseph put upon a clean bed, the room cleared of every appearance of blood, and the instruments which were used in the operation removed, I was permitted again to enter.</p>

<li id="_note-date-of-vision"><b><a  title="">^</a></b> Joseph Smith, Jr. dated the vision to when he was "a little over fourteen years of age" (<a href="/wiki/Early_life_of_Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr.#CITEREFRoberts_1902.html" title="Early life of Joseph Smith, Jr.">Roberts 1902</a>, vol. 1, ch. 1, p. 7), which would have been 1820.

<li id="_note-Moroni-date"><b><a  title="">^</a></b> The date of Moroni's first visits is generally taken as 1823. However, Smith's 1832 history (his first written account) dates the visit of <a href="/wiki/Moroni_%28prophet%29.html" title="Moroni (prophet)">Moroni</a> to <a href="/wiki/September_22.html" title="September 22">September 22</a>, <a href="/wiki/1822.html" title="1822">1822</a>, a year earlier, although he also states he was seventeen years old (<a href="/wiki/Early_life_of_Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr.#CITEREFSmith1832.html" title="Early life of Joseph Smith, Jr.">Smith 1832</a>, p. 3), and his seventeenth birthday would not have been until <a href="/wiki/December_23.html" title="December 23">December 23</a>, <a href="/wiki/1822.html" title="1822">1822</a>. Further possible ambiguity arises because in an 1830 interview, <a href="/wiki/Joseph_Smith%2C_Sr..html" title="Joseph Smith, Sr.">Joseph Smith, Sr.</a> reportedly claimed that he was not told about Moroni's visit until a year after the fact, during which Smith, Jr. had been collecting items in preparation for receiving the plates (<a href="/wiki/Early_life_of_Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr.#CITEREFLapham1870.html" title="Early life of Joseph Smith, Jr.">Lapham 1870</a>, p. 305). <a href="/wiki/Lucy_Mack_Smith.html" title="Lucy Mack Smith">Lucy Mack Smith</a> asserts that Smith, Sr. was told about Moroni's visit in 1823, the day after Moroni's first visit (<a href="/wiki/Early_life_of_Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr.#CITEREFSmith1838.html" title="Early life of Joseph Smith, Jr.">Smith 1838</a>, p. 7); (<a href="/wiki/Early_life_of_Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr.#CITEREFSmith1853.html" title="Early life of Joseph Smith, Jr.">Smith 1853</a>, p. 82); however, Lucy's history also indicates that after the appearance of the angel, Joseph had made two annual visits to the hill <a href="/wiki/Cumorah.html" title="Cumorah">Cumorah</a> before the 1823 death of her son Alvin (<a href="/wiki/Early_life_of_Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr.#CITEREFSmith1853.html" title="Early life of Joseph Smith, Jr.">Smith 1853</a>, p. 85), which Lucy incorrectly dated to 1824 (<a href="/wiki/Early_life_of_Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr.#CITEREFSmith1853.html" title="Early life of Joseph Smith, Jr.">Smith 1853</a>, p. 87).</li>
