<p>The <b>election for governor of the U.S. state of Washington</b> in the year <a href="/wiki/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a> gained national attention for its legal twists and turns and its extremely close finish. Three parties, the <a href="/wiki/Democratic_Party_%28United_States%29.html" title="Democratic Party (United States)">Democratic Party</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Republican_Party_%28United_States%29.html" title="Republican Party (United States)">Republican Party</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Libertarian_Party_%28United_States%29.html" title="Libertarian Party (United States)">Libertarian Party</a>, fielded candidates. The <a href="/wiki/Primary_election.html" title="Primary election">primary election</a> was held on <a href="/wiki/September_14.html" title="September 14">September 14</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/General_election.html" title="General election">general election</a> was held on <a href="/wiki/November_2.html" title="November 2">November 2</a>. It is notable for being among the closest races in United States election history; the winner, <a href="/wiki/Christine_Gregoire.html" title="Christine Gregoire">Christine Gregoire</a>, a <a href="/wiki/Democratic_Party_%28United_States%29.html" title="Democratic Party (United States)">Democrat</a>, was elected after a second recount turned the election in her favor by a margin of 129 votes, or 0.0045%.</p>
<p>On the day of <a href="/wiki/December_30.html" title="December 30">December 30</a>, Christine Gregoire was officially declared the victor of the third count (the second recount), conducted by hand, partially delayed by a court order preventing <a href="/wiki/King_County%2C_Washington.html" title="King County, Washington">King County</a> from including over 700 <a href="/wiki/Ballot.html" title="Ballot">ballots</a> that county officials said were improperly rejected.

<p><a name="The_primaries" id="The_primaries"></a></p>
<h2>The primaries</h2>
<p>The 2004 election cycle was the first in Washington state to use a party-line ballot system of holding <a href="/wiki/Primary_election.html" title="Primary election">primary elections</a>. The state had a long tradition of using <a href="/wiki/Blanket_primary.html" title="Blanket primary">blanket primaries</a>, where the candidates of all <a href="/wiki/Political_party.html" title="Political party">political parties</a> appear together on the same ballot for all voters. In this system, the leading vote-getter from each party advances to the general election. Washington voters are not registered by party affiliation and a voter could participate in selecting candidates for more than one party, although the voter could only choose one candidate (of whatever party) for each office.</p>
<p>In February 2004 the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Supreme_Court.html" title="United States Supreme Court">United States Supreme Court</a> declined to review a lower court decision striking down the blanket primary as unconstitutional, based on it violating the rights of the parties to <a href="/wiki/Freedom_of_association.html" title="Freedom of association">freedom of association</a> under the <a href="/wiki/First_Amendment.html" title="First Amendment">First Amendment</a>. Washington was thus forced to devise a new primary election system. The state legislature passed a bill providing that the top two vote-getters for each office in the primary would advance to the general election, regardless of which political party they belonged to. Voters would still be allowed to vote for any candidate as before. However, this measure was <a href="/wiki/Veto.html" title="Veto">vetoed</a> by Governor <a href="/wiki/Gary_Locke.html" title="Gary Locke">Gary Locke</a> in favor of a "Montana-style" system that requires voters to choose a ballot for one specific party and vote only on that party's candidates in the primary.</p>
<p>The primary election in 2004 was held using the new system, but a campaign to replace it was already underway. The <a href="/wiki/Grange_movement.html" title="Grange movement">Washington State Grange</a>, which had helped institute the blanket primary in 1935, filed <a href="/wiki/Initiative.html" title="Initiative">Initiative</a> 872 to implement the "top-two" primary instead, which would once again allow voters to cross party lines in the primary election but now send the top two vote-getters to the general election. In districts dominated by one party, the "top-two" system could result in Democrat- or Republican-only general election races. Supporters claimed it would bring back voter choice across party lines and allow independent voters to participate in the primary; opponents said it would exclude <a href="/wiki/Third_party_%28United_States%29.html" title="Third party (United States)">third parties</a> and independent candidates from general election ballots, and would in fact reduce general election voter choice. The initiative was put to a public vote in November 2004, and passed with 60 percent of the vote. <sup id="_ref-60percentofvote_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[2]</a></sup> The state Republican, Democratic and Libertarian parties sued,<sup id="_ref-however_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[3]</a></sup> however, and a federal district court judge ruled in 2005 that the measure was unconstitutional because it too infringed the parties' First Amendment right to select their own candidates.<sup id="_ref-owncandidate_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[4]</a></sup> Washington continued with the party-line primary system while appealing the case.<sup id="_ref-appealingthecase_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[5]</a></sup></p>

<h3>Democratic primary</h3>
<p>In July 2003, <a href="/wiki/Incumbent.html" title="Incumbent">incumbent</a> governor <a href="/wiki/Gary_Locke.html" title="Gary Locke">Gary Locke</a> indicated that he would not seek a third term, opening up the <a href="/wiki/Washington_State_Democratic_Party.html" title="Washington State Democratic Party">Democratic</a> primary to alternate candidates. Former Washington State Supreme Court justice <a  class="new" title="Phil Talmadge">Phil Talmadge</a> was the first candidate to enter the race for the Democratic primary, challenging <a href="/wiki/Gary_Locke.html" title="Gary Locke">Gary Locke</a> before he announced his retirement, but Washington Attorney-General <a href="/wiki/Christine_Gregoire.html" title="Christine Gregoire">Christine Gregoire</a> quickly became the frontrunner, leading in fundraising and endorsements. <a href="/wiki/King_County%2C_Washington.html" title="King County, Washington">King County</a> Executive <a href="/wiki/Ron_Sims.html" title="Ron Sims">Ron Sims</a> announced his candidacy, but failed to garner much interest, perhaps due to his association with the controversial <a href="/wiki/Sound_Transit.html" title="Sound Transit">Sound Transit</a> <a href="/wiki/Light_rail.html" title="Light rail">light rail</a> project. According to a March 2004, Mellman Group poll, Gregoire would beat both Sims and Talmadge 36 percent to 11 percent and four percent in an <a href="/wiki/Open_primary.html" title="Open primary">open primary</a>, and would beat Sims 55 percent to 17 percent in a <a href="/wiki/Closed_primary.html" title="Closed primary">closed primary</a>.<sup id="_ref-Mellmangroup_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[6]</a></sup> On <a href="/wiki/April_29.html" title="April 29">April 29</a>, <a href="/wiki/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>, Talmadge announced he was withdrawing from the race following the discovery of a benign <a href="/wiki/Kidney.html" title="Kidney">kidney</a> <a href="/wiki/Tumor.html" title="Tumor">tumor</a>, citing the likely need for surgery and associated recovery time.</p>

<h2>Campaigns</h2>
<p>Both Gregoire and Rossi ran as centrists and promised to change the political landscape in Washington, and both made <a href="/wiki/Employment.html" title="Employment">job</a> and <a href="/wiki/Economy.html" title="Economy">economic</a> growth the centerpiece of their campaigns. Gregoire ran on the promise to boost job growth in the state which had slowed greatly after the <a href="/wiki/Dot_com.html" title="Dot com">dot com</a> <a href="/wiki/Bubble_economy.html" title="Bubble economy">bubble</a> burst in 2001, to improve <a href="/wiki/Education.html" title="Education">education</a>, and to increase access to <a href="/wiki/Health_care.html" title="Health care">health care</a>.</p>
<p>The Rossi campaign presented its own job-growth plan, and stated that 20 years of Democratic governors were to blame for the economic troubles in the state. However, during the general election he was criticized for a strongly conservative voting record that was at odds with his moderate campaign posture. Rossi was also criticized for his long-time professional association with a <a href="/wiki/Real_estate_broker.html" title="Real estate broker">real estate broker</a> convicted of fraud, and for alleged <a href="/wiki/R%C3%A9sum%C3%A9.html" title="Résumé">résumé</a> embellishments. Rossi had worked against <i><a href="/wiki/Roe_v._Wade.html" title="Roe v. Wade">Roe v. Wade</a></i>, attacked opponents for supporting <a href="/wiki/Gay_rights.html" title="Gay rights">gay rights</a>, and proclaimed that <a href="/wiki/Creationism.html" title="Creationism">creationism</a> should be taught in <a href="/wiki/Public_school.html" title="Public school">public schools</a>. Although Rossi campaigned on being <a href="/wiki/Pro-life.html" title="Pro-life">pro-life</a> and in favor of state and federal Constitutional Amendments that would ban all benefits and legal contracts for gay couples, he downplayed his long history of fundamentalist "rhetoric" and claimed he was a "fiscal moderate with a social conscience." Rossi also would not publicly state his opinion over <a href="/wiki/Stem_cell.html" title="Stem cell">stem cell</a> research.</p>
<p>The Gregoire campaign focused on Gregoire's <a href="/wiki/Goliath.html" title="Goliath">David and Goliath</a>-like record of challenging big <a href="/wiki/Tobacco.html" title="Tobacco">tobacco</a> and <a href="/wiki/Pharmaceutical.html" title="Pharmaceutical">pharmaceutical</a> companies in her tenure as state Attorney-General. Gregoire also proposed a major state-lead initiative in life sciences, especially stem cell research, where she proposed investing <a href="/wiki/United_States_dollar.html" title="United States dollar">$</a>500 million of a tobacco settlement the state hopes to receive in 2008. Her economic plan for the state focused on improving state infrastructure and improving the quality of education in the state, which she claimed would attract investors. Gregoire also stated that she believed Washington residents should be allowed to buy <a href="/wiki/Prescription.html" title="Prescription">prescription medicine</a> from <a href="/wiki/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canada</a>, while Rossi said that he needed to be convinced it "was safe".<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a  title="">[7]</a></sup> Gregoire was criticized for being a part of the state government establishment, but tried to counter Rossi's "time for a change" message by saying that she would "blow past the <a href="/wiki/Bureaucracy.html" title="Bureaucracy">bureaucracy</a>" and bring change herself. This language surprised and disappointed many of her colleagues and supporters, who saw it as a failure to give mention or credit to the efforts and achievements of past Democratic governors.</p>
<p>Gregoire was also strongly criticized in many <a href="/wiki/Attack_ad.html" title="Attack ad">attack ads</a> for an incident which occurred in 2000, when Gregoire's office failed to file documents on time to appeal a record $17.8 million personal-injury verdict against Washington. Documents from an independent investigation conducted at the time of the incident show that Gregoire's deputies attempted to influence who was listed as responsible for the missed deadline.

<h3>Initial results</h3>
<p>Gregoire led in almost all polls conducted leading up to the election, but Rossi was able to close in on her late in the race and won considerable support from <a href="/wiki/Eastern_Washington.html" title="Eastern Washington">Eastern Washington</a>. He also ran much stronger than expected in <a href="/wiki/Snohomish_County%2C_Washington.html" title="Snohomish County, Washington">Snohomish</a> and <a href="/wiki/Pierce_County%2C_Washington.html" title="Pierce County, Washington">Pierce</a> Counties. Gregoire received strong support (nearly a three-to-two margin) from the largest county in the state, <a href="/wiki/King_County%2C_Washington.html" title="King County, Washington">King County</a>, which includes heavily Democratic <a href="/wiki/Seattle%2C_Washington.html" title="Seattle, Washington">Seattle</a>.

<p><a name="Absentee_ballots" id="Absentee_ballots"></a></p>
<h3>Absentee ballots</h3>
<p>Washington is unusual for a U.S. state in that it only requires that an absentee ballot be postmarked by the day of the election to be valid, while most other states require the ballot to have arrived at the election office by that time. Due to this as well as the state's high number of absentee ballots — more than 60 percent of all King County voters voted absentee — the initial result of the election was not known until <a href="/wiki/November_17.html" title="November 17">November 17</a>, the last day under state law for election results to be certified by each county's election officials.</p>
<p>One point of controversy was signatures on provisional and absentee ballots. In many eastern Washington counties, the county election offices provided the political parties with the names of people whose absentee and provisional ballots have been ruled invalid due to issues with missing or non-matching signatures. The Republican Party began calling these voters to inform them their ballot was invalid and to give them information on how to contact the election offices to get their ballots validated. The Democratic Party sought the same list from heavily Democratic King County but was rebuffed. The party sued, and on <a href="/wiki/November_12.html" title="November 12">November 12</a> a King County judge ruled that the county election board would have to turn over the list of 936 voters whose ballots were invalidated due to signature problems to all parties with candidates in the race. While the Democratic Party canvassed these residences from <a href="/wiki/November_13.html" title="November 13">November 13</a> through the <a href="/wiki/November_16.html" title="November 16">16th</a>, the GOP began sending vans into the rural counties to drive voters with invalid ballots to election offices.</p>
<p>Another state law allows for election officials to evaluate voter intent and correct ballots so that the machines can properly read them. For example, on a <a href="/wiki/Scantron.html" title="Scantron">Scantron</a> or other optical ballot, an election official might fill in a circle that was not properly marked so that the machine may record the vote. Republicans filed a federal lawsuit to stop the visual examination of ballots, claiming that it is not allowed under federal law. This lawsuit was not successful since Washington's state laws govern the elections within the state.</p>

<h3>First results and recounts</h3>
<p>The first ballot count was concluded on <a href="/wiki/November_17.html" title="November 17">November 17</a>, and Secretary of State <a href="/wiki/Sam_Reed.html" title="Sam Reed">Sam Reed</a> reported that Rossi held a lead of 261 votes. This was well within the margin (less than 0.5 percent and less than 2,000 votes) that automatically requires a full machine recount by state law. The state-wide recount was completed on <a href="/wiki/November_24.html" title="November 24">November 24</a>, showing Rossi with a lead of 42 over Gregoire. Of the 39 counties in Washington, Rossi carried 32 and Gregoire 7.</p>
<p>In Washington, a candidate may request one hand count or machine count, provided that they pay for the estimated cost of the recount up front. If a manual recount overturns the outcome of an election, the state will then refund the money to the candidate. As Gregoire disputed the result, the Washington State Democratic Party gave a check for $730,000 to the Secretary of State on <a href="/wiki/December_3.html" title="December 3">December 3</a>. The Secretary of State issued the order for a recount on Monday, <a href="/wiki/December_6.html" title="December 6">December 6</a>. The state GOP had also indicated before the machine recount that they would have sought a manual recount were the outcome in favor of Rossi reversed.</p>

</div>
<p><a href="/wiki/King_County_Council.html" title="King County Council">King County Council</a> Chairman <a  class="new" title="Larry Phillips">Larry Phillips</a> was at a Democratic Party office in Seattle on Sunday <a href="/wiki/December_12.html" title="December 12">December 12</a>, reviewing a list of voters whose absentee votes had been rejected due to signature problems, when to his surprise he found his own name listed. Phillips said he was certain he had filled out and signed his ballot correctly, and asked the county election officials to investigate the discrepancy. They discovered that Phillips' signature had somehow failed to be scanned into the election computer system after he submitted his request for an absentee ballot. Election workers claimed that they had received Phillips' absentee ballot in the mail, but they could not find his signature in the computer system to compare to the one on the ballot envelope, so they mistakenly discarded the ballot instead of following the standard procedure of checking it against the signature of Phillips' physical voter registration card that was on file. The discovery prompted King County Director of Elections <a  class="new" title="Dean Logan">Dean Logan</a> to order his staff to search the computers to see if any other ballots had been incorrectly rejected.</p>
<p>Logan announced on <a href="/wiki/December_13.html" title="December 13">December 13</a> that 561 absentee ballots in the county had been wrongly rejected due to an administrative error. The next day, workers retrieving voting machines from precinct storage found an additional 22 ballots, bringing the total to 583 newly discovered ballots. Logan admitted the lost ballots were an oversight on the part of his department, and insisted that the found ballots be counted. On <a href="/wiki/December_15.html" title="December 15">December 15</a>, the King County Canvassing Board voted 2-1 in favor of counting the discovered ballots.</p>
<p>Upon examination of the discovered ballots, it was further discovered that, with the exception of two ballots, none of the ballots had been cast by voters whose surnames began with the letters A, B, or C. There was a further search for more ballots, and on <a href="/wiki/December_17.html" title="December 17">December 17</a>, county workers discovered a tray in a warehouse with an additional 150 previously uncounted ballots. All together, 723 uncounted or improperly rejected ballots were discovered in King County during the manual hand recount.</p>
<p>The state Republican party regarded the discovered ballots in King County cynically, with chairman <a href="/wiki/Chris_Vance.html" title="Chris Vance">Chris Vance</a> stating that he was "absolutely convinced that King County is trying to steal this election." The <a href="/wiki/National_Rifle_Association.html" title="National Rifle Association">National Rifle Association</a> (NRA), which had endorsed Rossi, sent a mass <a href="/wiki/E-mail.html" title="E-mail">e-mail</a> on <a href="/wiki/December_14.html" title="December 14">December 14</a> to its members asking for volunteers to go to King County in order to sit in on the county elections office and observe the recount.</p>
<p>State Republicans, labeling the ballots "suspicious", filed suit to have a <a href="/wiki/Restraining_order.html" title="Restraining order">restraining order</a> put on counting the ballots. The request was granted on <a href="/wiki/December_17.html" title="December 17">December 17</a>, but Democrats appealed, which led to a State Supreme Court hearing on <a href="/wiki/December_22.html" title="December 22">December 22</a>. As the early results of the manual recount showed a single-digit vote lead for Gregoire, both sides expected the inclusion of the discovered ballots to increase their respective candidate's lead. <a href="/wiki/Protester.html" title="Protester">Protesters</a> gathered in front of both Democratic state headquarters and Republican state headquarters in the days after the injunction against King County's discovered ballots. On <a href="/wiki/December_21.html" title="December 21">December 21</a>, Republican protestors rallied in front of the Washington State Supreme Court Building dressed in <a href="/wiki/Orange_%28colour%29.html" title="Orange (colour)">orange</a> and holding signs saying "<a href="/wiki/Ukraine.html" title="Ukraine">Welcome to Ukraine</a>", comparing the inclusion of the discovered ballots to the election fraud in the recent <a href="/wiki/Ukrainian_presidential_election%2C_2004.html" title="Ukrainian presidential election, 2004">Ukrainian presidential election</a>.<sup id="_ref-rallies_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[9]</a></sup> Protest websites appeared for both sides of the dispute, such as "<a  class="external text" title="http://web.archive.org/web/20050212142044/http://www.accidentalgovernor.com/">Accidental Governor</a>" (archive; site no longer active) and "<a  class="external text" title="http://www.gregoirethegrinch.com">How Gregoire The Grinch Stole Christmas</a>".</p>
<p>After all other counties submitted their recount votes, it was revealed on <a href="/wiki/December_20.html" title="December 20">December 20</a> that at least five other counties besides King County had included ballots that had been discovered after the initial count. For example, <a href="/wiki/Snohomish_County%2C_Washington.html" title="Snohomish County, Washington">Snohomish County</a> included 224 missed ballots that had been discovered underneath <a href="/wiki/Mail.html" title="Mail">mail trays</a>. The outcome of the State Supreme Court hearing regarding King County's votes could have potentially affected those counties' counts as well.</p>

<h3>Manual recount results</h3>
<p>The state Democratic party claimed on <a href="/wiki/December_21.html" title="December 21">December 21</a> that, without consideration of the 700 discovered ballots which were not counted due to an injunction, the result of the manual recount, including King County's votes, placed Gregoire ahead by eight votes across the state. Later, on <a href="/wiki/December_22.html" title="December 22">December 22</a>, the preliminary recount results put Gregoire at a ten-vote lead.</p>
<p>The Washington State Supreme Court ruled on <a href="/wiki/December_22.html" title="December 22">December 22</a> that counties explicitly have the ability to correct ballot consideration errors made during earlier counts. The next day, King County's final tally, including the disputed ballots, gave Gregoire a 130 vote lead, which was later revised to 129 when it was discovered that <a href="/wiki/Thurston_County%2C_Washington.html" title="Thurston County, Washington">Thurston County</a> had added a vote after certification had been completed. However, this change by Thurston County was disallowed upon final certification by Sam Reed, as this change happened after certification. Since the recount results were in favor of the party requesting the recount, the Democrats were reimbursed the recount costs they had advanced to the state.</p>
<p>The Republicans were already preparing for further legal action before the final tally was announced by canvassing Republican voters whose ballots had been rejected. On <a href="/wiki/December_29.html" title="December 29">December 29</a>, Rossi called for a re-vote, saying that "this election has been a total mess" and that a "revote would be the best solution for the people of our state and would give us a legitimate governorship". This solution had been rejected by the Democrats and Republican Secretary of State <a href="/wiki/Sam_Reed.html" title="Sam Reed">Sam Reed</a> because Washington's election law contains no re-vote provision, which left a lawsuit the only other option. Reed officially certified the results of the manual recount on <a href="/wiki/December_30.html" title="December 30">December 30</a>, declaring Gregoire the governor-elect.</p>

<p>The Washington Republican Party's first question regarding the accuracy of the ballot counts was calling into question the discrepancy between the list of voters casting <a href="/wiki/Ballot.html" title="Ballot">ballots</a> in King County (895,660) and the number of ballots reported in the final hand recount (899,199). As an explanation, election officials claimed that they had yet to finalize the list at the time, and argued that discrepancies in the two numbers are common and do not necessarily indicate fraud. As the election officials had expected, once the two lists were completed on <a href="/wiki/January_5.html" title="January 5">January 5</a>, the two numbers were indeed very close to one another.</p>
<p>By law, the result of the election can be contested by any individual who files suit at any time up to 10 days after any inauguration, thereby making <a href="/wiki/January_22.html" title="January 22">January 22</a> the latest date to have filed any suit. Two private citizens filed challenges to the election on <a href="/wiki/January_6.html" title="January 6">January 6</a>: Daniel P. Stevens of <a href="/wiki/Fall_City%2C_Washington.html" title="Fall City, Washington">Fall City</a> and Arthur Coday, Jr. of <a href="/wiki/Shoreline%2C_Washington.html" title="Shoreline, Washington">Shoreline</a>. The Republican party filed a suit on <a href="/wiki/January_7.html" title="January 7">January 7</a> in <a href="/wiki/Chelan_County%2C_Washington.html" title="Chelan County, Washington">Chelan County</a> claiming that voters had been deprived of their right to a "free and fair election", and demanding a revote by <a href="/wiki/Special_election.html" title="Special election">special election</a>. While the evidence focused especially on problems in King County, adjacent Chelan was chosen as the venue because it was more solidly Republican and the GOP questioned the ability of King County judges to rule impartially in such a case.</p>
<p>Neither suit asked for Gregoire's inauguration to be delayed, allowing governor <a href="/wiki/Gary_Locke.html" title="Gary Locke">Gary Locke</a> to leave his post as scheduled. Gregoire was inaugurated on <a href="/wiki/January_12.html" title="January 12">January 12</a>. On <a href="/wiki/February_4.html" title="February 4">February 4</a>, <a href="/wiki/Judge.html" title="Judge">Judge</a> <a href="/wiki/John_E._Bridges.html" title="John E. Bridges">John E. Bridges</a>, assigned by Chelan County to preside over the case, ruled that the court did not have the authority to order a re-election. However, in the same ruling, he also rejected the Democrats' argument that only the state legislature, which then had a Democratic majority, and not the court, had the sole authority to decide whether an election was invalid, thereby indicating that he intended to proceed to trial. Both sides declared victory over this early pre-trial ruling.</p>
<p>Both sides used different arguments to prove their case. The Republicans presented data showing discrepancies in absentee ballot counts from 11 King County precincts. In some precincts, the county tallied more <a href="/wiki/Vote-by-mail.html" title="Vote-by-mail">mail-in ballots</a> than there were voters recorded as having voted by mail. In others, the opposite occurred—the county recorded more voters than ballots. The proof that ballots were fabricated for Democrats, Republican attorneys argued, is that four of the five precincts with the most excess mail-in ballots backed Gregoire. And as proof that ballots were misplaced or destroyed to harm Republicans, they pointed to the fact that four of the six precincts in which the most mail-in votes cannot be accounted for backed Republican Dino Rossi.</p>
<p>Democrats argued that evidence did not support this theory. For example, there were 703 King County precincts in which there were more <a href="/wiki/Absentee_ballot.html" title="Absentee ballot">absentee voters</a> than ballots, not just six. The Republicans said in court that "ballots were undercounted mostly in precincts that backed [Rossi]", but 500 of these 703 precincts, or 71 percent, actually backed Gregoire. The Democrats also countered, alleging that there had been fraudulent manipulation of some electronic voting machines. To prove this, the Democrats claimed that in <a href="/wiki/Snohomish_County%2C_Washington.html" title="Snohomish County, Washington">Snohomish County</a>, two-thirds of the electorate voted with paper absentee and <a href="/wiki/Provisional_ballot.html" title="Provisional ballot">provisional ballots</a>, favoring Gregoire by 1,816 votes (97,044 to 95,228). The remaining one-third, voting <a href="/wiki/Electronic_voting.html" title="Electronic voting">electronically</a>, favored Rossi by an 8,255-vote advantage (50,400 to 42,145).</p>
<p>Furthermore, in precincts with <a href="/wiki/Voting_machine.html" title="Voting machine">voting machines</a> that were repaired within two weeks of the election, Rossi had a touch screen advantage in 56 out of 58 (96.6 percent). The average margin for Rossi at these polling places was 11.58 percent more favorable than the absentee votes, and averaged 10.8 percent more than Gregoire on Election Day. However, the Republicans countered this by stating that among 90 precincts with no reported machine problems, 44 had touch screen vote counts more favorable to Rossi than the paper ballots from the same precinct, while 46 had a touch screen count that favored Gregoire. This raises serious questions as to whether the machines requiring repairs were tampered with to improperly assign votes to Rossi. The Republicans also claimed that King County was three days past its federally required due date of <a href="/wiki/October_10.html" title="October 10">October 10</a> to send out its absentee ballots to voters in the <a href="/wiki/Military.html" title="Military">military</a>, who are widely considered more likely to vote Republican. The <a href="/wiki/United_States_Postal_Service.html" title="United States Postal Service">United States Postal Service</a> <a href="/wiki/Bulk_mail.html" title="Bulk mail">Bulk Permit</a> #1455 was used to mail 1,605 ballots on <a href="/wiki/October_2.html" title="October 2">October 2</a>, and 28,000 on <a href="/wiki/October_13.html" title="October 13">October 13</a>. The Republicans claimed that the delay could have prevented military servicepeople from voting, thereby skewing the results in King County. On air, local talk radio host <a href="/wiki/Bryan_Suits.html" title="Bryan Suits">Bryan Suits</a> claimed that his vote in particular was not counted while he performed military service in Iraq.</p>
<p>Bridges denied a motion on <a href="/wiki/February_19.html" title="February 19">February 19</a> by the Democrats which argued that the challengers must prove that the disputed ballots necessarily made a difference in the outcome of the election by showing how many of the ballots were cast for which candidate. The Republicans admitted that they could not provide this proof, but argued that the volume of illegal ballots, and the electoral tendencies of the counties in which they were cast, demonstrated a strong likelihood that the illegal ballots had led to Gregoire's victory. On <a href="/wiki/February_26.html" title="February 26">February 26</a>, as a part of the Republican suit, Rossi's legal team produced a list of 1,135 <a href="/wiki/Felon.html" title="Felon">felons</a>, <a href="/wiki/Dead.html" title="Dead">deceased</a> people, or people who allegedly <a href="/wiki/Ballot_stuffing.html" title="Ballot stuffing">voted twice</a>, whom <a href="/wiki/Attorney.html" title="Attorney">attorneys</a> claimed influenced the outcome. A substantial number of the felon-voters were convicted as juveniles and were legally permitted to vote.<sup id="_ref-permittedvote_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[10]</a></sup> Conservative columnists suggested that felons were more likely to vote for Gregoire, but most of the felon-voters resided in counties won by Rossi.<sup id="_ref-felonsmorelikely_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[11]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-wonbyrossi_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[12]</a></sup></p>
<p>As a solution to the problem of the illegal voters, the Republicans proposed a solution of "proportional reduction". Republicans claimed that it should be assumed that illegal votes were cast in the same percentages as other votes in the same precinct. For example, in a precinct where Gregoire won 60 percent of the vote, it would have been assumed that she received 60 percent of the illegal vote as well, and those votes wold be subtracted from her total for the precinct. The Democrats countered that the Republicans' proposal was statistically invalid, an example of the <a href="/wiki/Ecological_fallacy.html" title="Ecological fallacy">ecological fallacy</a>, and the best solution would be to call each of the felons into court and ask them to swear under <a href="/wiki/Oath.html" title="Oath">oath</a> which political candidate they voted for, after which time their vote would be removed from the total.</p>
<p>The trial began on <a href="/wiki/May_23.html" title="May 23">May 23</a>, with both sides presenting their evidence of manipulation. Bridges issued his ruling on <a href="/wiki/June_6.html" title="June 6">June 6</a>, upholding the election of Gregoire. He stated that the judiciary should exercise restraint; "unless an election is clearly invalid, when the people have spoken, their verdict should not be disturbed by the court."<sup id="_ref-Bridgesverdict_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[13]</a></sup> Nullifying the election, Bridges said, would be "the ultimate act of judicial egotism and judicial activism." He also concluded that according to his interpretation of the Washington Administrative Code, "voters who improperly cast <a href="/wiki/Provisional_ballot.html" title="Provisional ballot">provisional ballots</a> should not be disenfranchised." He also rejected all claims of <a href="/wiki/Fraud.html" title="Fraud">fraud</a> and the Republican Party's statistical analysis, concluding that the <a href="/wiki/Expert_testimony.html" title="Expert testimony">expert testimony</a> of the Republican party was "not helpful" and that the proportional reduction theory was not supported under any law in the state. Striking another blow against Rossi's court case, he stated that "the court is more inclined to believe that Gregoire would have prevailed under statistical analysis theory," rejecting the Rossi campaign's claim that improperly cast ballots led to Gregoire's victory.</p>
<p>Bridges also removed five votes from the final count after receiving testimony from convicted <a href="/wiki/Felon.html" title="Felon">felons</a> who had voted: four for Rossi and one for Ruth Bennett. No evidence was brought before the court of anyone illegally voting for Gregoire. The final margin of victory for Gregoire over Rossi was 133 votes.</p>
<p>Judge Bridges' ruling was seen as a comprehensive defeat for Rossi. The judge admitted nearly every piece of evidence the Republican Party offered and then wrote a thorough, tough opinion rejecting the Republicans' claims (while criticizing the administration of the election, particularly in King County); Rossi was left with very little legal ground for a successful appeal. After receiving such a negative <a href="/wiki/Verdict.html" title="Verdict">verdict</a>, Rossi declined to appeal to the State Supreme Court, claiming that the political makeup of the Court would make it impossible for him to win, thereby ending all legal challenges to the election of Gregoire as the Governor of Washington.</p>

<h2>Fallout</h2>
<p>The controversy and election contest had notable repercussions across the state, from corrective government action to increased interest in voter-initiated propositions of varied severity.</p>
<p>With the aim of repairing flaws in the state electoral system, many of which were uncovered during the course of the recounts, Gregoire, along with Reed, formed an election reform task force that traveled throughout the major cities of the state. The panel presented an array of recommendations on <a href="/wiki/March_3.html" title="March 3">March 3</a>, including such suggestions as holding primary elections at an earlier date, requiring ID at polling places, implementing a central statewide voter database, and regular audits of registration records. Some of the proposals could be implemented immediately under Reed's authority as Secretary of State. Many of the recommendations are the same as those proposed by the State Senate Government Operations and Elections committee on <a href="/wiki/February_18.html" title="February 18">February 18</a>. Other election reform proposals have suggested the state move to an entirely mail-based ballot system. Efforts at significant reform have not been successful.</p>
<p>As the state official responsible for overseeing the administration of elections, Secretary of State Sam Reed, known as a moderate Republican, came under attack from both sides at various points. After his certification of Gregoire's election, a number of Republicans claimed he had acted inappropriately and submitted a <a href="/wiki/Recall.html" title="Recall">recall</a> proposition to remove Reed as Secretary of State. However, a <a href="/wiki/Thurston_County%2C_Washington.html" title="Thurston County, Washington">Thurston County</a> judge denied the move on <a href="/wiki/February_15.html" title="February 15">February 15</a>. Reed and his supporters insist that he followed the letter of the law and had no sufficient reason not to certify Gregoire. The office of Secretary of State was also a party to the various legal proceedings (technically, challenges by one party were directed against government officials, with the opposing party allowed to participate due to its interest in the outcome). Observers noted that during the trial, Judge Bridges frequently sided with Reed's position as a sort of neutral party in the case.</p>
<p>In the aftermath of the trial, the state Democratic Party also filed a lawsuit against the Republican Party for court costs. It argued that the election contest statutes provided for the prevailing party's court costs to be paid by the loser. The matter was settled with the Republicans agreeing to pay $15,000, thus bringing an end to all legal proceedings related to the election.</p>
