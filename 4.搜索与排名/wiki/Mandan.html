<p>The <b>Mandan</b> are a <a href="/wiki/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States.html" title="Native Americans in the United States">Native American</a> tribe that historically lived along the banks of the <a href="/wiki/Missouri_River.html" title="Missouri River">Missouri River</a> and its tributaries, the <a href="/wiki/Heart_River.html" title="Heart River">Heart</a> and <a href="/wiki/Knife_River.html" title="Knife River">Knife</a> rivers in present-day <a href="/wiki/North_Dakota.html" title="North Dakota">North</a> and <a href="/wiki/South_Dakota.html" title="South Dakota">South Dakota</a>. Unlike many neighboring tribes in the <a href="/wiki/Great_Plains.html" title="Great Plains">Great Plains</a> region, the Mandan practiced agriculture and established permanent villages. These villages were composed of round <a href="/wiki/Earth_house.html" title="Earth house">earthen lodges</a> surrounding a central plaza. In addition to farming, the Mandan gathered wild plants and berries and hunted <a href="/wiki/American_bison.html" title="American bison">buffalo</a>. Unlike other tribes in the region which led a <a href="/wiki/Nomad.html" title="Nomad">nomadic</a> existence following herds of buffalo, the Mandan developed a religious ceremony to bring the buffalo closer to their villages. This ceremony, known as the Okipa, served not only to attract buffalo but to renew the world for another year.</p>
<p>Archaeological research suggests the Mandan people migrated from the <a href="/wiki/Ohio_River.html" title="Ohio River">Ohio River</a> valley to the banks of the Missouri River. They were first encountered by Europeans along the Missouri in 1738. The Mandan's friendliness and willingness to trade brought many traders and <a href="/wiki/Fur_trade.html" title="Fur trade">fur trappers</a> to their villages over the next century. By the turn of the 19th century, because of attacks by neighboring tribes and epidemics of <a href="/wiki/Smallpox.html" title="Smallpox">smallpox</a> and <a href="/wiki/Whooping_cough.html" title="Whooping cough">whooping cough</a>, the numbers of the Mandan had diminished dramatically. Beginning in 1837, a major smallpox outbreak reduced the number of Mandan to approximately 125.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a  title="">[1]</a></sup> With such meager numbers, the Mandan banded together with two neighboring tribes, the <a href="/wiki/Arikara.html" title="Arikara">Arikara</a> and <a href="/wiki/Hidatsa.html" title="Hidatsa">Hidatsa</a>.</p>
<p>In an effort to establish good relations, the U.S. government founded the Fort Berthold Agency to care for the combined tribes. The Agency soon set up the <a href="/wiki/Fort_Berthold_Reservation.html" title="Fort Berthold Reservation">Fort Berthold Reservation</a>. With the 1934 <a href="/wiki/Indian_Reorganization_Act.html" title="Indian Reorganization Act">Indian Reorganization Act</a>, the Mandan officially merged with the Hidatsa and the Arikara into the "<a href="/wiki/Three_Affiliated_Tribes.html" title="Three Affiliated Tribes">Three Affiliated Tribes</a>," known as the Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara Nation. About half of the Mandan still reside in the area of the reservation, the rest residing around the United States and in Canada.</p>

<h2>Synonymy</h2>
<p>The English name <i>Mandan</i> is derived from similar <a href="/wiki/Exonym.html" title="Exonym">exonyms</a> from surrounding Siouan languages, such as <a href="/wiki/Lakota_language.html" title="Lakota language">Teton</a> <i>Miwátąni</i>, <a href="/wiki/Yanktonai.html" title="Yanktonai">Yanktonai</a> <i>Miwátani</i>, <a  class="new" title="Yankton (people)">Yankton</a> <i>Mawátani</i> or <i>Mąwátanį</i>, <a href="/wiki/Sioux#Dakota.html" title="Sioux">Dakota</a> <i>Mawátąna</i> or <i>Mawátadą</i>, etc. The Mandan have used several terms at different times to refer to themselves:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Rųwą́ʔka·ki</i> "men, people": before 1837 (transcribed by Westerners as <i>Numakaki</i>, <i>Numangkake</i>)</li>
<li><i>Wį́ʔti Ų́tahąkt</i> "East Village" (after the village of the same name): late 19th century (transcribed by Westerners as <i>Metutahanke</i> or <i>Mitutahankish</i>)</li>
<li><i>Rų́ʔeta</i> "ourselves, our people" (originally the name of a specific division): the currently-used term</li>
</ul>
<p>The Mandan probably used <i>Rųwą́ʔka·ki</i> to refer to a general tribal entity. Later, this word fell to disuse and instead two divisions names were used, <i>Nuweta</i> or <i>Ruptare</i> (i.e. Mandan <i>Rų́ʔeta</i>). Later the term, <i>Rų́ʔeta</i> was extended to refer to a general tribal entity. The name <i>Mi-ah´ta-nēs</i> recorded by Ferdinand Vandeveer Hayden in 1862 reportedly means "people on the river bank", but this is may be a <a href="/wiki/Folk_etymology.html" title="Folk etymology">folk etymology</a>. Various other terms and alternate spellings that occur in the literature including: Mayátana, Mayátani, Mąwádanį, Mąwádąδį, Huatanis, Mandani, Wahtani, Mantannes, Mantons, Mendanne, Mandanne, Mandians, Maw-dân, Meandans, les Mandals, Me-too´-ta-häk, Numakshi, Rųwą́ʔkši, Wíhwatann, Mevatan, Mevataneo.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a  title="">[2]</a></sup> Gloria Jahoda in her book <i>Trail of Tears</i> states that they also call themselves the "Pheasant people."<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a  title="">[3]</a></sup></p>

<p>The <a href="/wiki/Mandan_language.html" title="Mandan language">Mandan language</a> belongs to the <a href="/wiki/Siouan_languages.html" title="Siouan languages">Siouan language family</a>. It was initially thought to be closely related to the languages of the <a href="/wiki/Hidatsa.html" title="Hidatsa">Hidatsa</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Crow_Tribe.html" title="Crow Tribe">Crow</a>. However, since the Mandan language has been in <a href="/wiki/Language_contact.html" title="Language contact">contact</a> with Hidatsa and Crow for many years, the exact relationship between Mandan and other Siouan languages (including Hidatsa and Crow) has been obscured and is currently undetermined. For this reason, Mandan is most often considered to be a separate branch of the Siouan family.</p>
<p>Mandan has two main <a href="/wiki/Dialect.html" title="Dialect">dialects</a>: Nuptare and Nuetare. Only the Nuptare variety survived into the 20th century, and all speakers were bilingual in Hidatsa. As of 1999, there were only six fluent speakers of Mandan still alive, though there are currently programs in local schools to encourage the use of the language.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a  title="">[4]</a></sup> Linguist <a  class="new" title="Mauricio Mixco">Mauricio Mixco</a> of the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Utah.html" title="University of Utah">University of Utah</a> has been involved in fieldwork with remaining speakers since 1993.</p>
<p>The Mandan and their language received much attention from Euro-Americans because of their lighter skin color, which some speculated was due to an ultimate European origin. In the 1830s <a href="/wiki/Prince_Maximilian_of_Wied.html" title="Prince Maximilian of Wied">Prince Maximilian of Wied</a> spent more time recording Mandan over all other Siouan languages and additionally prepared a comparison list of Mandan and <a href="/wiki/Welsh_language.html" title="Welsh language">Welsh</a> words (he thought that the Mandan may be displaced Welsh).<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a  title="">[5]</a></sup> The theory of the Mandan/Welsh connection, now discounted, was also supported by <a href="/wiki/George_Catlin.html" title="George Catlin">George Catlin</a>. As the Mandans encouraged conjugal relations between their women and European and American explorers and fur-traders (probably in an attempt to incorporate their perception of a cultural advantage over enemy tribes), a "lighter skin color" would in time be a natural consequence. The Journals of Lewis and Clark often refer to members of the expedition being invited to spend the night in the Mandan lodges, and it was likely there that several of these men contracted venereal diseases. Today the hunt for the original site of the expedition's next winter home at Fort Clatsop, Oregon, at the headwaters of the Columbia, relies on a search for the capsules of mercury which members of the expedition used to treat the disease.</p>
<p>Mandan has different grammatical forms that depend on <a href="/wiki/Gender.html" title="Gender">gender</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Addressee.html" title="Addressee">addressee</a>. Questions asked of men must use the <a href="/wiki/Suffix.html" title="Suffix">suffix</a> <i><span class="Unicode">-oʔša</span></i> while the suffix <i><span class="Unicode">-oʔrą</span></i> is used when asking of women.

<p>One of the most recognizable features of the Mandan was their permanent villages made up of earthen lodges. Each lodge was circular with a <a href="/wiki/Dome.html" title="Dome">dome</a>-like roof and a square hole at the apex of the dome through which smoke could escape. The exterior was covered with a matting made from reeds and twigs and then covered with hay and earth. The lodge also featured a <a href="/wiki/Portico.html" title="Portico">portico</a>-type structure at the entrance. The interior had four large pillars upon which crossbeams supported the roof. These lodges were designed, built and owned by the women of the tribe, and ownership was passed through the female line. Lodges could hold up to 30 or 40 people and villages usually had around 120 lodges.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a  title="">[8]</a></sup> Reconstructions of these lodges may be seen at <a href="/wiki/Fort_Abraham_Lincoln_State_Park.html" title="Fort Abraham Lincoln State Park">Fort Abraham Lincoln State Park</a> near <a href="/wiki/Mandan%2C_North_Dakota.html" title="Mandan, North Dakota">Mandan, North Dakota</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/Knife_River_Indian_Villages_National_Historic_Site.html" title="Knife River Indian Villages National Historic Site">Knife River Indian Villages National Historic Site</a>. Originally lodges were rectangular, but around 1500 <a href="/wiki/Common_Era.html" title="Common Era">CE</a>, lodges began to be constructed in a circular form. Towards the end of the 19th century, the Mandan began constructing small <a href="/wiki/Log_cabin.html" title="Log cabin">log cabins</a>, usually with two rooms. When traveling or hunting, the Mandan would use skin <a href="/wiki/Tipi.html" title="Tipi">tipis</a>.<sup id="_ref-zimmerman_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[9]</a></sup> Today, Mandan live in modern dwellings.</p>
<p>Villages were usually oriented around a central <a href="/wiki/Plaza.html" title="Plaza">plaza</a> that was used for games and ceremonial purposes. In the center of the plaza was a tree surrounded by a wood enclosure representing the Lone Man, one of the main figures in Mandan mythology, who built a wooden wall thus saving the people of the world from a deluge. Villages were often situated on high bluffs over the river. Often, villages would be constructed at the meeting of tributaries in order to use the water as a natural barrier. Where there were few or no natural barriers, the villages utilized some type of fortification including ditches and <a href="/wiki/Palisade.html" title="Palisade">palisades</a>.</p>

<p>Some speculate that the lodging, religion, and occasional blue eyes among the Mandan were remnants of Viking explorers, who left the Kensington Runestone as evidence of contact with the plains Indians.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a  title="">[10]</a></sup></p>

<h3>Family life</h3>
<p>The Mandan were originally divided into thirteen <a href="/wiki/Clans.html" title="Clans">clans</a> organized around successful hunters and their kin. Each clan was expected to care for its own, including orphans and the elderly, from birth to death. Clans held a sacred bundle, which consisted of a few gathered objects believed to hold sacred powers. Those in possession of the bundles were considered to have sacred powers bestowed to them by the spirits and thus were considered the leaders of the clan and tribe.</p>
<p>Children were named ten days after their birth in a naming ceremony, which also officially linked the child with their family and clan. Girls would be taught domestic duties, farming, and how to keep a home, while boys were taught hunting and fishing, and would begin <a href="/wiki/Fasting.html" title="Fasting">fasting</a> at the age of ten or eleven. Marriage among the Mandan was generally arranged by members of one's own clan, though occasionally it would take place without the approval of the couple's parents.

<p>Upon the death of a family member, a scaffold would be erected near the village to contain the body. The body would be placed with the head towards the northwest and feet to the southeast. (Southeast is the direction of the Ohio River Valley, from whence the Mandan came. The Mandan would not sleep in this orientation, because it invited death.) After a ceremony to send the spirit away, the family would mourn at the scaffold for four days. After the body rotted and the scaffold collapsed, the bones would be gathered up and buried except for the skull, which was placed in a circle near the village. Family members would visit the skulls and talk to them, sometimes bearing their problems or regaling the dead with jokes. After the Mandan moved onto the Fort Berthold Reservation, they resorted to placing the bodies in boxes or trunks or wrapped them in fur robes and placed them in rocky crevices.</p>

<p>The Mandan survived by hunting, farming and gathering wild plants, though some food came from trade. Mandan gardens were often located near river banks, where annual flooding would leave the most fertile soil, sometimes in locations miles from villages. The gardens were owned and tended by the women, and they would plant <a href="/wiki/Maize.html" title="Maize">corn</a>, <a href="/wiki/Beans.html" title="Beans">beans</a> and <a href="/wiki/Squash_%28fruit%29.html" title="Squash (fruit)">squash</a>, usually enough to last a single year.</p>
<p>The buffalo which the Mandan hunted played an important part in Mandan rituals; calling the buffalo near to the village being one of the main objectives of the Okipa ceremony at the beginning of each summer. In addition to eating the flesh, the Mandan used all remaining parts of the buffalo, so nothing went to waste. The hides were used for buffalo-fur robes or were tanned, and the leather used for clothing and other uses. The Mandan were known for their painted buffalo hides that often recorded historic events. The bones would be carved into items such as needles and <a href="/wiki/Fish_hook.html" title="Fish hook">fish hooks</a>. Bones were also used in farming, such as the <a href="/wiki/Scapula.html" title="Scapula">scapula</a>, which was used as a <a href="/wiki/Hoe_%28tool%29.html" title="Hoe (tool)">hoe</a>-like device for breaking the soil.

Deer <a href="/wiki/Antlers.html" title="Antlers">antlers</a> were used to create <a href="/wiki/Rake_%28tool%29.html" title="Rake (tool)">rake</a>-like implements used in farming.

<p>Up until the late <a href="/wiki/19th_century.html" title="19th century">19<sup>th</sup> century</a> when they began adopting Western-style dress, the Mandan commonly wore clothing made from the hides of buffalo as well as deer and sheep.

These items were often ornamented with quills and bird feathers and sometimes even the <a href="/wiki/Scalping.html" title="Scalping">scalps</a> of enemies.</p>
<p>Mandan women wore ankle-length dresses made of deerskin or sheepskin. This would often be girded at the waist with a wide belt. Sometimes the hem of the dress would be ornamented with pieces of buffalo <a href="/wiki/Hoof.html" title="Hoof">hoof</a>.

<p>During the winter months, men would commonly wear deerskin tunics and leggings with moccasins. They also kept themselves warm by wearing a robe of buffalo fur. During the summer months, however, a loincloth of deerskin or sheepskin would often suffice. Unlike the women, men would wear various ornaments in their hair. The hair was parted across the top with three sections hanging down in front. Sometimes the hair would hang down the nose and would be curled upwards with a curling stick. The hair would hang to the shoulders on the side, and the back portion would sometimes reach to the waist. The long hair in the back would create a tail-like feature, as it would be gathered into braids then smeared with <a href="/wiki/Clay.html" title="Clay">clay</a> and <a href="/wiki/Spruce.html" title="Spruce">spruce</a> gum then tied with cords of deerskin.

<h3>Religion</h3>
<p>Of the tribes living on the Great Plains, the Mandan's religion was one of the more complex. Much of their mythology centered on a figure known as <a  class="new" title="Lone Man">Lone Man</a>. Lone Man was involved in many of the creation myths as well as one of the deluge myths. In their <a href="/wiki/Creation_myth.html" title="Creation myth">creation myth</a>, the world was created by two rival deities, the First Creator and the Lone Man. The Missouri River divided the two worlds that the beings created. First Creator created the lands to the south of the river with hills, valleys, trees, buffalo, <a href="/wiki/Pronghorn.html" title="Pronghorn">antelope</a> and snakes. To the north of the river, Lone Man created the Great Plains, domesticated animals, birds, fish and humans. The first humans lived underground near a large lake. Some of the more adventurous humans climbed a grapevine to the surface and discovered the two worlds. After returning underground they shared their findings and decided to return with many others. As they were climbing the grapevine it broke and half of the Mandan were left underground.<sup id="_ref-dyingtongues_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[12]</a></sup></p>
<p>According to pre-Christian Mandan beliefs, each person possessed four different, immortal <a href="/wiki/Souls.html" title="Souls">souls</a>. The first soul was white and often seen as a shooting star. The second soul was colored a light brown and was seen in the form of the <a href="/wiki/Western_meadowlark.html" title="Western meadowlark">meadowlark</a>. The third soul, called the lodge spirit, remained at the site of the lodge after death and would remain there forever. The final soul was black and after death would travel away from the village. These final souls existed as did living people; residing in their own villages, farming and hunting.<sup id="_ref-zimmerman_1" class="reference"><a  title="">[9]</a></sup></p>

The okipa ceremony as witnessed by George Catlin, circa 1835.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>One notable feature of the Mandan’s religious life was the Okipa, which was first recorded by George Catlin. The ceremony opened with a Bison Dance followed by a variety of torturous ordeals through which warriors proved their courage and gained the approval of the <a href="/wiki/Spirit.html" title="Spirit">spirits</a>. The Okipa began with the warriors sitting with smiling faces while the skin of their chest was pierced with sticks. Using the sticks to support the weight of their bodies, the warriors would be suspended from the roof of the lodge and would hang there until they fainted. After fainting, the warrior would be pulled down and the men (women were not allowed to attend this ceremony) would watch the warrior until he awoke, proving the spirits' approval. After awakening, the warrior would sacrifice the little finger on both hands, each finger being severed by a <a href="/wiki/Medicine_man.html" title="Medicine man">medicine man</a> with a knife. Finally, the warrior would be taken outside where he would run around the central plaza of the village a number of times. Those finishing the ceremony were seen as being honored by the spirits; those completing the ceremony twice would gain everlasting fame among the tribe. Chief Four Bears or Ma-to-toh-pe completed this ceremony twice.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a  title="">[13]</a></sup> The last Okipa ceremony was performed in 1889 but the ceremony was resurrected in a somewhat different form in 1983.<sup id="_ref-dyingtongues_1" class="reference"><a  title="">[12]</a></sup> The version of the Okipa as practiced by the Lakota may be seen in the 1970 film <i><a href="/wiki/A_Man_Called_Horse.html" title="A Man Called Horse">A Man Called Horse</a></i> starring <a href="/wiki/Richard_Harris_%28actor%29.html" title="Richard Harris (actor)">Richard Harris</a>.</p>

<h3>Origins and early history</h3>
<p>Like all Native American peoples, the exact origins and early history of the Mandan is unknown. Early studies by linguists gave evidence that the Mandan language may have been closely related to the language of the <a href="/wiki/Ho-Chunk.html" title="Ho-Chunk">Ho-Chunk</a> or Winnebago people of present-day <a href="/wiki/Wisconsin.html" title="Wisconsin">Wisconsin</a>, which has given rise to the theory that they may have settled in the region at one time. This idea is possibly confirmed in their mythology, where reference is made to having come from an eastern location near a lake.</p>
<p>Ethnologists and scholars studying the Mandan subscribe to the theory that, like other Sioux people (possibly including the Hidatsa), they originated in the area of the upper <a href="/wiki/Mississippi_River.html" title="Mississippi River">Mississippi River</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Ohio_River.html" title="Ohio River">Ohio River</a> in present-day <a href="/wiki/Ohio.html" title="Ohio">Ohio</a>. If this is the case, the Mandan would have migrated north towards the Missouri River valley and its tributary the Heart River in present-day <a href="/wiki/North_Dakota.html" title="North Dakota">North Dakota</a>, where Europeans first encountered them. This migration is believed to have occurred possibly as early as the 7th century but probably between 1000 CE and the 13th century.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a  title="">[14]</a></sup></p>
<p>After their arrival on the banks of the Heart River, the Mandan constructed nine villages, two on the east side of the river and seven on the west side. At some point during this time, the Hidatsa people also moved into the region. Mandan tradition states that the Hidatsa were a nomadic tribe until their encounter with the Mandan, who taught them to build stationary villages and agriculture. The Hidatsa continued to maintain amicable relations with the Mandan and constructed villages north of them on the Knife River.</p>

<p>The first encounter with Europeans occurred with the visit of the French Canadian trader <a href="/wiki/Pierre_Gaultier_de_Varennes_et_de_la_V%C3%A9rendrye.html" title="Pierre Gaultier de Varennes et de la Vérendrye">Sieur de la Verendrye</a> in 1738. It is estimated that at the time of his visit there were approximately 15,000 Mandan residing in the nine villages on the Heart River.<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a  title="">[15]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Horses.html" title="Horses">Horses</a> were acquired by the Mandan in the mid-18th century and were used for transportation and hunting. The horses helped with the expansion of Mandan hunting territory. The encounter with the French in the 18th century created a trading link between the French and the Native Americans of the region with the Mandan serving as <a href="/wiki/Middleman.html" title="Middleman">middlemen</a> in the of trade in furs, horses, <a href="/wiki/Gun.html" title="Gun">guns</a>, crops and buffalo products.</p>
<p>In 1796 the Mandan were visited by the Welsh explorer <a href="/wiki/John_Evans_%28explorer%29.html" title="John Evans (explorer)">John Evans</a>, who was hoping to find proof that their language contained Welsh words. Evans spent the winter of 1796-7 with the Mandan, but found no evidence of any Welsh influence.</p>
<p>By 1804 when <a href="/wiki/Lewis_and_Clark.html" title="Lewis and Clark">Lewis and Clark</a> visited the tribe, the number of Mandan had been greatly reduced due to smallpox epidemics and warring bands of <a href="/wiki/Assiniboin.html" title="Assiniboin">Assiniboins</a>, <a href="/wiki/Lakota.html" title="Lakota">Lakotas</a> and Arikaras (whom they would later join together with to fight against the Lakota). The nine villages at this point had consolidated into two villages. The Lewis and Clark expedition met with such hospitality in the Upper Missouri River villages that the expedition stopped there for the winter. In honor of their hosts, the expedition dubbed the settlement they constructed Fort Mandan. It was here that Lewis and Clark first met <a href="/wiki/Sakakawea.html" title="Sakakawea">Sakakawea</a>, a <a href="/wiki/Shoshone.html" title="Shoshone">Shoshone</a> woman who had been captured by the Hidatsa.

<p>The Mandan were first plagued by smallpox in the 16th century and had been hit by similar epidemics every few decades. Between 1837 and 1838, another smallpox epidemic swept the region. In June 1837, an <a href="/wiki/American_Fur_Company.html" title="American Fur Company">American Fur Company</a> steamboat traveled westward up the Missouri River from St. Louis. Its passengers and traders aboard infected the Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara tribes. There were approximately 1,600 Mandan living in the two villages at that time. The disease effectively destroyed the Mandan settlements. Almost all the tribal members, including the <a href="/wiki/Tribal_chief.html" title="Tribal chief">chief</a>, Four Bears, died. Estimates of the number of survivors vary from only 27 individuals to up to 150, though most sources usually give the number 125. The survivors banded together with the nearby Hidatsa in 1845 and created <a href="/wiki/Like-a-Fishhook_Village.html" title="Like-a-Fishhook Village">Like-a-Fishhook Village</a>.</p>

<p>The Mandan joined with the Arikara in 1862. By this time, Like-a-Fishhook Village had become a major center of trade in the region. By the 1880s, though, the village was abandoned. With the second half of the 19th century there was a gradual decrease in the holdings of the Three Affiliated Tribes (the Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara). The <a href="/wiki/Fort_Laramie_Treaty_%281851%29.html" title="Fort Laramie Treaty (1851)">Fort Laramie Treaty</a> of 1851 recognized 12 million acres (49,000 km²) of land in the territory owned jointly by these tribes.

<p>With the arrival of the 20th century, the government seized more land, and by 1910, the reservation had shrunk to a mere 900,000 acres (3,600 km²).<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a  title="">[18]</a></sup> This land is located in <a href="/wiki/Dunn_County%2C_North_Dakota.html" title="Dunn County, North Dakota">Dunn</a>, <a href="/wiki/McKenzie_County%2C_North_Dakota.html" title="McKenzie County, North Dakota">McKenzie</a>, <a href="/wiki/McLean_County%2C_North_Dakota.html" title="McLean County, North Dakota">McLean</a>, <a href="/wiki/Mercer_County%2C_North_Dakota.html" title="Mercer County, North Dakota">Mercer</a>, <a href="/wiki/Mountrail_County%2C_North_Dakota.html" title="Mountrail County, North Dakota">Mountrail</a> and <a href="/wiki/Ward_County%2C_North_Dakota.html" title="Ward County, North Dakota">Ward</a> counties in North Dakota. In 1951, the <a href="/wiki/U.S._Army_Corps_of_Engineers.html" title="U.S. Army Corps of Engineers">U.S. Army Corps of Engineers</a> began construction of <a href="/wiki/Garrison_Dam.html" title="Garrison Dam">Garrison Dam</a> on the Missouri River. This dam created <a href="/wiki/Lake_Sakakawea.html" title="Lake Sakakawea">Lake Sakakawea</a>, which flooded portions of the Fort Berthold Reservation including the villages of Fort Berthold and Elbowoods as well as a number of other villages. The former residents of these villages were moved and <a href="/wiki/New_Town%2C_North_Dakota.html" title="New Town, North Dakota">New Town</a> was established for them.</p>
<p>While a new town was constructed for the displaced tribal members, much damage was done to the social and economic foundations of the reservation. The flooding claimed approximately one quarter of the reservations land. This land contained some of the most fertile agricultural land upon which the agricultural economy had been constructed. In addition, the flooding claimed the sites of historic villages and archaeological sites.</p>

<p>The Mandan and the two related tribes while being combined have intermarried but do maintain, as a whole, the varied traditions of their ancestors. The last full-blood Mandan died in 1971.<sup id="_ref-dyingtongues_2" class="reference"><a  title="">[12]</a></sup> The tribal residents have recovered from the trauma of their displacement in the 1950s and part of their recovery has been aided by two recent additions to New Town. The Four Bears Casino and Lodge was constructed in 1993 drawing tourists and money to the impoverished reservation.<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a  title="">[19]</a></sup> The most recent addition to the New Town area has been the new <a href="/wiki/Four_Bears_Bridge.html" title="Four Bears Bridge">Four Bears Bridge</a>, which was built in a joint effort between the three tribes and the North Dakota Department of Transportation. The bridge, spanning the Missouri River, replaces an older Four Bears Bridge that was built in 1955. The new bridge—the largest bridge in the state of North Dakota—is decorated with medallions celebrating the cultures of the three tribes. The bridge was opened to traffic <a href="/wiki/September_2.html" title="September 2">2 September</a> <a href="/wiki/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a> and was officially opened in a ceremony on the <a href="/wiki/October_3.html" title="October 3">3 October</a>.<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a  title="">[20]</a></sup></p>
