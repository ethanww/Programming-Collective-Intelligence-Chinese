It is one of the most controversial cases in U.S. Supreme Court history.</p>
<p>The decision in <i>Roe v. Wade</i> prompted a still-continuing national debate over whether terminating pregnancies should be legal (or more precisely, whether a state can choose to deem the act <i>illegal</i>), the role of the Supreme Court in constitutional adjudication, and the role of <a href="/wiki/Religion.html" title="Religion">religious</a> views in the political sphere. <i>Roe v. Wade</i> became one of the most politically significant Supreme Court decisions in history, reshaping national politics, dividing the nation into "<a href="/wiki/Pro-Choice.html" title="Pro-Choice">pro-choice</a>" and "<a href="/wiki/Pro-Life.html" title="Pro-Life">pro-life</a>" camps, and inspiring <a href="/wiki/Grassroots.html" title="Grassroots">grassroots</a> activism.</p>
<p>Opposition to <i>Roe</i> comes primarily from those who viewed the Court's decision as illegitimate for straying too far from the text and history of the Constitution, and those possessing beliefs about the <a href="/wiki/Personhood.html" title="Personhood">personhood</a> of <a href="/wiki/Fetus.html" title="Fetus">fetal</a> <a href="/wiki/Human.html" title="Human">human</a> life.</p>
<p>Support for <i>Roe</i> comes from those who view the decision as necessary to preserve <a href="/wiki/Feminism.html" title="Feminism">women's equality</a> and personal freedom, and those who believe in the primacy of individual over collective rights, although the opposition to <i>Roe</i> often reference the primacy of the individual when referring to the fetus.</p>

<h2>History of case</h2>
<p>The case originated in Texas in March 1970 at the behest of young attorneys <a href="/wiki/Linda_Coffee.html" title="Linda Coffee">Linda Coffee</a> and <a href="/wiki/Sarah_Weddington.html" title="Sarah Weddington">Sarah Weddington</a>. Coffee and Weddington filed suit on behalf of <a href="/wiki/Norma_McCorvey.html" title="Norma McCorvey">Norma L. McCorvey</a> ("<a href="/wiki/Jane_Roe.html" title="Jane Roe">Jane Roe</a>") who claimed her pregnancy was the result of rape. McCorvey now says that she was lying, although at one point she went so far as to give a detailed account of her rape. Her (at the time) alleged rape was not mentioned or used in the arguments for <i>Roe v. Wade</i>, because the attorneys had determined McCorvey's claims to be questionable.</p>
<p>A three-judge district court ruled for "Jane Roe", but refused to grant against the enforcement of the laws.</p>
<p>Many advocates of liberalizing abortion laws saw promise in this line of cases, as abortion was widely <a href="/wiki/Proscription.html" title="Proscription">proscribed</a> by state laws at that time.</p>
<p>Both "Jane Roe" and defendant Wade appealed to the Supreme Court and the case was argued there by Weddington and Texas assistant attorney general Jay Floyd on December 13, 1971. Burger proposed that the case be put over for reargument, and the justices, unimpressed with the first oral argument in the case, underwhelmed by Blackmun's opinion, and wishing that new Justices William Rehnquist and Lewis F. Powell, Jr. participate, voted to reargue the case on October 11, 1972, at the behest of Chief Justice Burger. At the reargument, Weddington again represented Roe, while district attorney Wade was represented by Texas assistant attorney general Robert C. Flowers.</p>
<p>Douglas threatened to write a dissent from the reargument order, but was coaxed out of the action by his colleagues; his dissent was merely mentioned in the order without further statement or opinion.</p>

Justice Blackmun delivered the opinion of the Court.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><i>Roe</i> established that abortion, under the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Constitution.html" title="United States Constitution">United States Constitution</a>, is a <a href="/wiki/Fundamental_right.html" title="Fundamental right">fundamental right</a>, thereby subjecting all laws attempting to restrict it to the standard of <a href="/wiki/Strict_scrutiny.html" title="Strict scrutiny">strict scrutiny</a>. Though abortion technically remains to this day a <a href="/wiki/Fundamental_right.html" title="Fundamental right">fundamental right</a>, subsequent cases, notably <a href="/wiki/Planned_Parenthood_v._Casey.html" title="Planned Parenthood v. Casey">Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey</a> and <a href="/wiki/Stenberg_v._Carhart.html" title="Stenberg v. Carhart">Stenberg v. Carhart</a>, have modified the legal standard significantly.</p>
<p>The opinion of the Court, written by Justice <a href="/wiki/Harry_Blackmun.html" title="Harry Blackmun">Harry Blackmun</a>, notes that "the restrictive criminal abortion laws in effect in a majority of States today are of relatively recent vintage" with criminalization of abortion mostly occurring from law enacted in the latter half of the nineteenth century. Section VI of the opinion was devoted to an analysis of historical attitudes, including those of: the <a href="/wiki/Persia.html" title="Persia">Persian Empire</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ancient_Greece.html" title="Ancient Greece">Greek times</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Roman_era.html" title="Roman era">Roman era</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Hippocratic_oath.html" title="Hippocratic oath">Hippocratic oath</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Common_law.html" title="Common law">common law</a>, English <a href="/wiki/Statutory_law.html" title="Statutory law">statutory law</a>, American law, the <a href="/wiki/American_Medical_Association.html" title="American Medical Association">American Medical Association</a>, the <a  class="external text" title="http://www.apha.org/">American Public Health Association</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/American_Bar_Association.html" title="American Bar Association">American Bar Association</a>.</p>
<p>Without finding a historical basis for the laws, the Court identified three justifications in Section VII of the opinion to explain the criminalization of abortion: (1) women who can receive an abortion are more likely to engage in "illicit sexual conduct", (2) the medical procedure was extremely risky prior to the development of antibiotics and, even with modern medical techniques, is still risky in late stages of pregnancy, and (3) the state has an interest in protecting prenatal life. As to the first, "no court or commentator has taken the argument seriously" and the statute failed to "distinguish between married and unwed mothers." However, according to the Court, the second and third constitute valid state interests. In Section X, the Court reiterated, "[T]he State does have an important and legitimate interest in preserving and protecting the health of the pregnant woman ... and that it has still another important and legitimate interest in protecting the potentiality of human life."</p>
<p>Valid state interests, however, must be weighed against the constitutionally protected rights of individuals in order to determine whether a law is a constitutional exercise of power. Even though the "Constitution does not explicitly mention any right of privacy" the court found support for a constitutional right of privacy in the <a href="/wiki/First_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution.html" title="First Amendment to the United States Constitution">First Amendment</a>, <a href="/wiki/Fourth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution.html" title="Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution">Fourth Amendment</a>, <a href="/wiki/Fifth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution.html" title="Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution">Fifth Amendment</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ninth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution.html" title="Ninth Amendment to the United States Constitution">Ninth Amendment</a>, <a href="/wiki/Fourteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution.html" title="Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution">Fourteenth Amendment</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Penumbra.html" title="Penumbra">penumbra</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Bill_of_Rights.html" title="Bill of Rights">Bill of Rights</a>. The court found "this right of privacy" to be "broad enough to encompass a woman's decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy."</p>
<p>However, the Court determined that "arguments that Texas either has no valid interest at all in regulating the abortion decision, or no interest strong enough to support any limitation upon the woman's sole determination, are unpersuasive." The Court declared, "We, therefore, conclude that the right of personal privacy includes the abortion decision, but that this right is not unqualified and must be considered against important state interests in regulation."</p>
<p>When weighing the competing interests the Court also noted that if the <a href="/wiki/Fetus.html" title="Fetus">fetus</a> was defined as a person for purposes of the <a href="/wiki/Fourteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution.html" title="Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution">Fourteenth Amendment</a> then the fetus would have a specific right to life under that Amendment. However, given the relatively recent nature of abortion criminalization, the Court determined that the original intent of the Constitution up to the enactment of the <a href="/wiki/Fourteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution.html" title="Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution">Fourteenth Amendment</a> in <a href="/wiki/1868.html" title="1868">1868</a> did not include the unborn. The Court's determination of whether a fetus can enjoy Constitutional protection is separate from the notion of when life begins. To that, the Court said, "We need not resolve the difficult question of when life begins. When those trained in the respective disciplines of <a href="/wiki/Medicine.html" title="Medicine">medicine</a>, <a href="/wiki/Philosophy.html" title="Philosophy">philosophy</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Theology.html" title="Theology">theology</a> are unable to arrive at any consensus, the <a href="/wiki/Judiciary.html" title="Judiciary">judiciary</a>, at this point in the development of man's knowledge, is not in a position to speculate as to the answer."</p>
<p>Relying on the current state of medical knowledge, the decision established a system of <a href="/wiki/Trimester.html" title="Trimester">trimesters</a> that attempted to balance the state's legitimate interests with the individual's constitutional rights. The Court ruled that the state cannot restrict a woman's right to an abortion during the first trimester, the state can regulate the abortion procedure during the second trimester "in ways that are reasonably related to maternal health," and in the third trimester, demarcating the viability of the fetus, a state can choose to restrict or even to <a href="/wiki/Proscription.html" title="Proscription">proscribe</a> abortion as it sees fit.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Justiciability">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Justiciability" id="Justiciability"></a></p>
<h3>Justiciability</h3>
<p>An aspect of the decision that attracted comparatively little attention was the Court's disposition of the issues of <a href="/wiki/Standing_%28law%29.html" title="Standing (law)">standing</a> and <a href="/wiki/Mootness.html" title="Mootness">mootness</a>. The Supreme Court does not issue <a href="/wiki/Advisory_opinion.html" title="Advisory opinion">advisory opinions</a> (those stating what the law would be in some hypothetical circumstance). Instead, there must be an actual "<a href="/wiki/Case_or_controversy.html" title="Case or controversy">case or controversy</a>", including particularly a plaintiff who is aggrieved and seeks relief. In the <i>Roe</i> case, "Jane Roe," who began the litigation in March 1970, had already given birth by the time the case was argued before the Supreme Court in December 1971. By the traditional rules, therefore, there was an argument that Roe's appeal was moot because she would not be affected by the ruling, and also that she lacked standing to assert the rights of pregnant women (other than herself) seeking an abortion. The Court concluded, however, that the case came within an established exception to the rule, one that allowed consideration of an issue that was "capable of repetition, yet evading review." Justice Blackmun's opinion noted that human pregnancy would normally conclude more quickly than an appellate process. "If that termination makes a case moot, pregnancy litigation seldom will survive much beyond the trial stage, and appellate review will be effectively denied." Such a ruling was critical to the Supreme Court's power to review the case, since the Supreme Court dismissed the physician James Hubert Hallford's intervention and affirmed the dismissal of John and Mary Doe.</p>

<p>Associate Justices <a href="/wiki/Byron_R._White.html" title="Byron R. White">Byron R. White</a> and <a href="/wiki/William_H._Rehnquist.html" title="William H. Rehnquist">William H. Rehnquist</a> wrote blistering dissenting opinions in this case.</p>
<p>"I find nothing in the language or history of the Constitution to support the Court's judgment," wrote Justice White. "The Court simply fashions and announces a new constitutional right for pregnant mothers and, with scarcely any reason or authority for its action, invests that right with sufficient substance to override most existing state abortion statutes. The upshot is that the people and the legislatures of the 50 States are constitutionally disentitled to weigh the relative importance of the continued existence and development of the fetus, on the one hand, against a spectrum of possible impacts on the mother, on the other hand. As an exercise of raw judicial power, the Court perhaps has authority to do what it does today; but, in my view, its judgment is an improvident and extravagant exercise of the power of judicial review that the Constitution extends to this Court.</p>
<p>"The Court apparently values the convenience of the pregnant mother more than the continued existence and development of the life or potential life that she carries. Regardless of whether I might agree with that marshaling of values, I can in no event join the Court's judgment because I find no constitutional warrant for imposing such an order of priorities on the people and legislatures of the States. In a sensitive area such as this, involving as it does issues over which reasonable men may easily and heatedly differ, I cannot accept the Court's exercise of its clear power of choice by interposing a constitutional barrier to state efforts to protect human life and by investing mothers and doctors with the constitutionally protected right to exterminate it. This issue, for the most part, should be left with the people and to the political processes the people have devised to govern their affairs."</p>
<p>Justice Rehnquist elaborated on this, saying: "The Court's opinion decides that a State may impose virtually no restriction on the performance of abortions during the first trimester of pregnancy . . . the Court uses her complaint against the Texas statute as a fulcrum for deciding that States may [p172] impose virtually no restrictions on medical abortions performed during the first trimester of pregnancy. In deciding such a hypothetical lawsuit, the Court departs from the longstanding admonition that it should never "formulate a rule of constitutional law broader than is required by the precise facts to which it is to be applied . . . the Court's sweeping invalidation of any restrictions on abortion during the first trimester is impossible to justify under that standard, and the conscious weighing of competing factors that the Court's opinion apparently substitutes for the established test is far more appropriate to a legislative judgment than to a judicial one.</p>
<p>"To reach its result the Court necessarily has had to find within the scope of the Fourteenth Amendment a right that was apparently completely unknown to the drafters of the Amendment. As early as 1821, the first state law dealing directly with abortion was enacted by the Connecticut Legislature. Conn. Stat., Tit. 22, §§ 14, 16. By the time of the adoption of the Fourteenth [p175] Amendment in 1868, there were at least 36 laws enacted by state or territorial legislatures limiting abortion.(1) While many States have amended or updated [p176] their laws, 21 of the laws on the books in 1868 remain in effect today.(2) Indeed, the Texas statute struck down today was, as the majority notes, first enacted in 1857 [p177] and "has remained substantially unchanged to the present time." Ante, at 119.</p>
<p>"There apparently was no question concerning the validity of this provision or of any of the other state statutes when the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted. The only conclusion possible from this history is that the drafters did not intend to have the Fourteenth Amendment withdraw from the States the power to legislate with respect to this matter."</p>

<h2>Controversy over <i>Roe</i></h2>
<p>At first most of the protest over the <i>Roe</i> decision came from Catholic sources, who had been opposing abortion and contraception for over a century. They were later joined by many Protestants. Eventually there were letter-writing campaigns to the Supreme Court. The <a href="/wiki/Pro-life.html" title="Pro-life">Pro-life</a> supporters argued that life begins upon <a href="/wiki/Fertilisation.html" title="Fertilisation">conception</a>, and thus that the unborn should be entitled to legal protection. Many conservatives and other supporters of federalism objected to the decision as lacking a valid Constitutional foundation, maintaining that the Constitution is silent on the issue and that proper solutions to the question would best be found via state legislatures and the democratic process rather than through an all-encompassing ruling from the Supreme Court. Some lawyers felt justification could be found in the Constitution, but not in the articles referenced in the decision. Pro-life protesters frequently picket abortion clinics, distribute literature and other forms of persuasion to women considering abortion, and have promoted adoption efforts to steer women away from abortion. More extreme variants of the movement have also developed; abortion doctors have been the targets of harassment and even murder by individuals who claim that by taking the life of an abortion doctor they are actually saving the lives of many human fetuses. However, activists who advocate or practice violence against abortion providers or recipients are consistently denounced by virtually all prominent pro-life groups. Some abortion opponents have claimed that there exists a link between abortion and <a href="/wiki/Breast_cancer.html" title="Breast cancer">breast cancer</a>, and Texas has enacted a law requiring literature advancing this theory be distributed to women considering abortion. However, the National Cancer Institute (a division of the U.S. National Institutes of Health) advises that the available medical research does not support this conclusion at this time <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/Risk/abortion-miscarriage">[1]</a>. Every year on the anniversary of the decision, protesters continue to demonstrate outside the Supreme Court Building in <a href="/wiki/Washington%2C_D.C..html" title="Washington, D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a></p>
<p>In response to <i>Roe v. Wade</i>, several states enacted laws limiting abortion, including laws requiring parental consent for minors to obtain abortions, parental notification laws, spousal consent laws, spousal notification laws, laws requiring abortions to be performed in hospitals but not clinics, laws barring state funding for abortions, laws banning most very late term abortions utilizing <a href="/wiki/Intact_dilation_and_extraction.html" title="Intact dilation and extraction">intact dilation and extraction</a> procedures (colloquially referred to as <a href="/wiki/Partial-birth_abortion.html" title="Partial-birth abortion">partial-birth abortions</a>), laws requiring waiting periods before abortion, laws mandating that women read certain types of literature before choosing an abortion, and many more. The Congress in the 1970s passed the <a  class="new" title="Hyde Amendment">Hyde Amendment</a>, barring federal funding for abortion. Abortions are currently prohibited in overseas military hospitals, and the United States is barred from aiding international <a href="/wiki/Birth_control.html" title="Birth control">family planning</a> organizations that might advise abortions. The Supreme Court struck down several state restrictions on abortions in a long series of cases stretching from the mid-1970s to the late 1980s, but consistently upheld restrictions on funding, including the Hyde Amendment, in the case of <a  class="new" title="Harris v. McRae">Harris v. McRae</a> (1980).</p>
<p>Some academics also criticized the decision. In his 1973 article in the Yale Law Journal, <i>The Wages of Crying Wolf</i>,<a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.timothypcarney.com/wages-wolf.htm">[2]</a> Professor <a href="/wiki/John_Hart_Ely.html" title="John Hart Ely">John Hart Ely</a> criticized <i>Roe</i> as a decision which "is not constitutional law and gives almost no sense of an obligation to try to be." Supreme Court Justice <a href="/wiki/Ruth_Bader_Ginsburg.html" title="Ruth Bader Ginsburg">Ruth Bader Ginsburg</a>, and other liberals such as Massachusetts congressman <a href="/wiki/John_F._Tierney.html" title="John F. Tierney">John F. Tierney</a> and editorial writer <a href="/wiki/Michael_Kinsley.html" title="Michael Kinsley">Michael Kinsley</a>, have criticized the court's ruling in <i>Roe v. Wade</i> as terminating a nascent democratic movement to liberalize abortion laws which they contend might have built a more durable consensus in support of abortion rights.</p>
<p>Some academics supported the decision, including Judith Jarvis Thomson, who before the decision had offered an influential defense of abortion in <i>A Defense of Abortion</i>, printed in <i>Philosophy and Public Affairs</i>, vol. 1, no. 1 (1971), pp. 47-66. Several groups have also emerged dedicated to <i>Roe'</i>s defense. Many Americans vigorously support abortion rights as necessary to women's equality and personal liberty. Most prominent is the <a href="/wiki/National_Abortion_Rights_Action_League.html" title="National Abortion Rights Action League">National Abortion Rights Action League</a>, as well as <a href="/wiki/EMILY%27s_List.html" title="EMILY's List">EMILY's List</a>, a pro-choice <a href="/wiki/Political_action_committee.html" title="Political action committee">political action committee</a>. During his lifetime, <a href="/wiki/Harry_Blackmun.html" title="Harry Blackmun">Harry Blackmun</a>, author of the <i>Roe</i> opinion, also was a determined advocate for the decision, making speeches across the country praising Roe as essential to women's equality and reproductive freedom. During the 1980s and 1990s, pressure grew from these groups for the Democratic Party to take a unified stand in favor of <i>Roe</i>.</p>
<p>Fueled by the intensity of feelings in both its supporters and critics, the controversy over <i>Roe</i> shows no sign of abating. Justice <a href="/wiki/Stephen_Breyer.html" title="Stephen Breyer">Stephen Breyer</a> delineated the positions of the two camps in his opinion for the Court in 2000's <i><a href="/wiki/Stenberg_v._Carhart.html" title="Stenberg v. Carhart">Stenberg v. Carhart</a></i>:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Millions of Americans believe that life begins at conception and consequently that an abortion is akin to causing the death and violating the liberty of an innocent child; they recoil at the thought of a law that would permit it. Other millions fear that a law that forbids abortion would condemn many American women to lives that lack dignity, depriving them of personal liberty and leading those with least resources to undergo illegal abortions with the attendant risks of death and suffering.</i></dd>

<h3>'Arbitrary' and 'Legislative'</h3>
<p>Internal Supreme Court memoranda that surfaced in the <a href="/wiki/Library_of_Congress.html" title="Library of Congress">Library of Congress</a> in 1988, among the personal papers of Justice Douglas, and in the papers of other Justices, showed the private discussions of the Justices on the case. Blackmun said of the majority decision he authored: "you will observe that I have concluded that the end of the first trimester is critical. This is arbitrary, but perhaps any other selected point, such as quickening or viability, is equally arbitrary." Stewart said that the lines were "legislative" and wanted more flexibility and consideration paid to the state legislatures, though he joined Blackmun's decision. Professor Douglas Kmiec <a  class="external text" title="http://members.aol.com/abtrbng2/roememos.txt">testified</a> on Justice Marshall's papers to this effect before the House Judiciary Committee in 1996. The assertion that the Supreme Court was making a legislative decision is often repeated by opponents of the Court's decision. The lines that Blackmun chose are no longer in effect since <i><a href="/wiki/Planned_Parenthood_v._Casey.html" title="Planned Parenthood v. Casey">Planned Parenthood v. Casey</a></i> (1992).</p>

<h2><i>Roe's</i> role in subsequent decisions and politics</h2>
<p>Opposition to <i>Roe</i> on the bench grew as <a href="/wiki/President_of_the_United_States.html" title="President of the United States">President</a> <a href="/wiki/Ronald_Reagan.html" title="Ronald Reagan">Ronald Reagan</a>, who supported legislative restrictions on abortion, controversially made abortion his "<a href="/wiki/Litmus_test.html" title="Litmus test">litmus test</a>" for federal judicial appointments. In addition to White and Rehnquist, Reagan appointee <a href="/wiki/Sandra_Day_O%27Connor.html" title="Sandra Day O'Connor">Sandra Day O'Connor</a> began dissenting from the Court's abortion cases, arguing that the trimester-based analysis devised by the <i>Roe</i> Court was "unworkable." Shortly before his retirement from the bench, Chief Justice Warren Burger suggested that <i>Roe</i> be "reexamined," and the associate justice who filled Burger's place on the Court, Justice <a href="/wiki/Antonin_Scalia.html" title="Antonin Scalia">Antonin Scalia</a>, is a vigorous opponent of <i>Roe</i>. Concerns over a possible overturning of <i>Roe</i> played a major role in the defeat of <a href="/wiki/Robert_Bork.html" title="Robert Bork">Robert Bork</a>'s nomination to the Court, and the man eventually appointed to replace <i>Roe</i> supporter Lewis Powell, <a href="/wiki/Anthony_M._Kennedy.html" title="Anthony M.

In a concurring opinion, Justice O'Connor pointedly refused to reconsider <i>Roe</i>. Justice Antonin Scalia, in a concurring opinion, refused to join the plurality's opinion because it refused to overrule <i>Roe</i>, and criticized O'Connor's ambiguous position on the matter. Justice <a href="/wiki/Harry_Blackmun.html" title="Harry Blackmun">Harry Blackmun</a>, by now a passionate defender of his <i>Roe</i> opinion, dissented angrily, arguing that the plurality opinion signaled doom for the abortion right.</p>

<p>On February 24, 2006, the <a href="/wiki/South_Dakota_State_Legislature.html" title="South Dakota State Legislature">South Dakota State Legislature</a> passed a bill that was signed into law by <a href="/wiki/Governor_of_South_Dakota.html" title="Governor of South Dakota">Governor</a> <a href="/wiki/Mike_Rounds.html" title="Mike Rounds">Mike Rounds</a> on March 6, 2006. The law purports to make performing all abortions a felony, including those for pregnancies resulting from rape and incest. The bill does make an exception for a woman's health, but also directs the physician to make a resonable effort to save both mother and child. Should he fail to save the child (that is, if the child’s death is an unintended consequence of saving the mother), the doctor will not be prosecuted. The bill is worded as follows:</p>
<p>The bill states in Section 4:</p>
<p>"<b>No licensed physician who performs a medical procedure designed or intended to prevent the death of a pregnant mother is guilty of violating section 2 of this Act</b>." <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://legis.state.sd.us/sessions/2006/bills/HB1215enr.htm">[5]</a> Section 2 is the text of the bill that bans abortions, given below.</p>
<p>Section 4 continues:</p>
<p>"However, the physician shall make reasonable medical efforts under the circumstances to preserve both the life of the mother and the life of her unborn child in a manner consistent with conventional medical practice. Medical treatment provided to the mother by a licensed physician which results in the accidental or unintentional injury or death to the unborn child is not a violation of this statute." <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://legis.state.sd.us/sessions/2006/bills/HB1215enr.htm">[6]</a></p>
<p>The bill states in Section 2 (referenced in the wording of Section 4):</p>
<p>"No person may knowingly administer to, prescribe for, or procure for, or sell to any pregnant woman any medicine, drug, or other substance with the specific intent of causing or abetting the termination of the life of an unborn human being. No person may knowingly use or employ any instrument or procedure upon a pregnant woman with the specific intent of causing or abetting the termination of the life of an unborn human being." <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://legis.state.sd.us/sessions/2006/bills/HB1215enr.htm">[7]</a></p>
<p>Although the health of the mother is protected, doctors will be prosecuted for any other reason. Its sponsors hope that a court challenge of the law will provide a vehicle that will allow the Supreme Court to reconsider and overturn Roe.</p>

<p>Mississippi’s House Public Health Committee voted on February 27, 2006, to approve a ban on abortion similar to South Dakota’s. The Mississippi bill could be voted on in the full State House the following week, and if approved, move on to the State Senate. Governor Haley Barbour told reporters that he would probably sign the bill into law if it makes it to his desk, though said he would prefer it to have an exception for rape and incest. Mississippi already had some of the strictest state abortion laws, requiring a 24-hour waiting period and counseling for all abortions, and the notification of both parents for minors who seek the procedure.</p>
