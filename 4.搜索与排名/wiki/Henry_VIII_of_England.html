<p>Born at the <a href="/wiki/Palace_of_Placentia.html" title="Palace of Placentia">Palace of Placentia</a> at <a href="/wiki/Greenwich.html" title="Greenwich">Greenwich</a>, Henry VIII was the third child of <a href="/wiki/Henry_VII_of_England.html" title="Henry VII of England">Henry VII</a> and <a href="/wiki/Elizabeth_of_York.html" title="Elizabeth of York">Elizabeth of York</a>. His maternal grandparents were King <a href="/wiki/Edward_IV_of_England.html" title="Edward IV of England">Edward IV of England</a> and Queen <a href="/wiki/Elizabeth_Woodville.html" title="Elizabeth Woodville">Elizabeth Woodville</a>. Only three of Henry VIII's six siblings: <a href="/wiki/Arthur%2C_Prince_of_Wales.html" title="Arthur, Prince of Wales">Arthur</a> (the <a href="/wiki/Prince_of_Wales.html" title="Prince of Wales">Prince of Wales</a>), <a href="/wiki/Margaret_Tudor.html" title="Margaret Tudor">Margaret</a> and <a href="/wiki/Mary_Tudor_%28queen_consort_of_France%29.html" title="Mary Tudor (queen consort of France)">Mary</a>, survived infancy. His <a href="/wiki/House_of_Lancaster.html" title="House of Lancaster">Lancastrian</a> father acquired the throne by <a href="/wiki/Right_of_conquest.html" title="Right of conquest">right of conquest</a>, his army defeating and killing the last <a href="/wiki/Plantagenet.html" title="Plantagenet">Plantagenet</a> King <a href="/wiki/Richard_III_of_England.html" title="Richard III of England">Richard III</a>, but further solidified his hold by marrying Elizabeth, the daughter of the <a href="/wiki/Yorkist.html" title="Yorkist">Yorkist</a> King <a href="/wiki/Edward_IV_of_England.html" title="Edward IV of England">Edward IV</a>. In 1493, the young Henry was appointed Constable of <a href="/wiki/Dover_Castle.html" title="Dover Castle">Dover Castle</a> and Lord Warden of the <a href="/wiki/Cinque_Ports.html" title="Cinque Ports">Cinque Ports</a>. In 1494, he was created <a href="/wiki/Duke_of_York.html" title="Duke of York">Duke of York</a>. He was subsequently appointed <a href="/wiki/Earl_Marshal.html" title="Earl Marshal">Earl Marshal</a> of England and <a href="/wiki/Lord_Lieutenant_of_Ireland.html" title="Lord Lieutenant of Ireland">Lord Lieutenant of Ireland</a>, though still a child.</p>
<p>In 1501 he attended the wedding of his elder brother Arthur and <a href="/wiki/Catherine_of_Aragon.html" title="Catherine of Aragon">Catherine of Aragon</a>, who were at the time only about fifteen and sixteen years old, respectively. The two were sent to spend time in <a href="/wiki/Wales.html" title="Wales">Wales</a>, as was customary for the heir-apparent and his wife, but Arthur caught an infection and died. Consequently, at the age of eleven, Henry, Duke of York, found himself heir-apparent to the Throne. Soon thereafter, he was created <a href="/wiki/Prince_of_Wales.html" title="Prince of Wales">Prince of Wales</a>.</p>
<p>Henry VII was in a marital alliance between England and <a href="/wiki/Spain.html" title="Spain">Spain</a> through a marriage between Henry, Prince of Wales, and Catherine. Since the Prince of Wales sought to marry his brother's widow, he first had to obtain a dispensation from the <a href="/wiki/Pope.html" title="Pope">Pope</a> from the impediment of affinity. Catherine maintained that her first marriage was never consummated; if she were correct, no papal dispensation would have been necessary, but merely a dissolution of ratified marriage. Nonetheless, both the English and Spanish parties agreed on the necessity of a papal dispensation for the removal of all doubts regarding the legitimacy of the marriage. Due to the impatience of Catherine's mother, Queen <a href="/wiki/Isabella_of_Castile.html" title="Isabella of Castile">Isabella</a>, the Pope hastily granted his dispensation in a <a href="/wiki/Papal_bull.html" title="Papal bull">Papal Bull</a>. Thus, fourteen months after her husband's death, Catherine found herself engaged to his brother, the Prince of Wales. By 1505, however, Henry VII lost interest in an alliance with Spain, and the young Prince of Wales was forced to declare that his betrothal had been arranged without his assent.</p>

<h2>Early reign</h2>
<p>Henry VIII ascended the throne in 1509 upon his father's death. Some say that the young king actually fell in love with Catherine, who was considerably older than him. More likely, Catherine's father, the <a href="/wiki/Aragon.html" title="Aragon">Aragonese</a> King <a href="/wiki/Ferdinand_II_of_Aragon.html" title="Ferdinand II of Aragon">Ferdinand II</a>, desired to control England through his daughter, and consequently insisted on her marriage to the new English king. In any case, Henry VIII wed Catherine of Aragon about nine weeks after his accession on <a href="/wiki/June_11.html" title="June 11">June 11</a>, <a href="/wiki/1509.html" title="1509">1509</a> at <a href="/wiki/Greenwich.html" title="Greenwich">Greenwich</a>, despite the concerns of <a href="/wiki/Pope_Julius_II.html" title="Pope Julius II">Pope Julius II</a> and <a href="/wiki/William_Warham.html" title="William Warham">William Warham</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Archbishop_of_Canterbury.html" title="Archbishop of Canterbury">Archbishop of Canterbury</a>, regarding the marriage's validity.

From 1511 onwards, however, power was held by the ecclesiastic <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Cardinal_Wolsey.html" title="Thomas Cardinal Wolsey">Thomas Wolsey</a>. In 1511, Henry joined the <a href="/wiki/Catholic_League_%28Italian%29.html" title="Catholic League (Italian)">Holy League</a>, a body of European rulers opposed to the French King <a href="/wiki/Louis_XII_of_France.html" title="Louis XII of France">Louis XII</a>. The League also included such European rulers as Pope Julius II, the Holy Roman Emperor <a href="/wiki/Maximilian_I%2C_Holy_Roman_Emperor.html" title="Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor">Maximilian I</a>, and Ferdinand II, with whom Henry also signed the <a href="/wiki/Treaty_of_Westminster_%281511%29.html" title="Treaty of Westminster (1511)">Treaty of Westminster</a>. Henry personally joined the English Army as they crossed the <a href="/wiki/English_Channel.html" title="English Channel">English Channel</a> into France, and took part in sieges and battles. In 1514, however, Ferdinand left the alliance, and the other parties made peace with the French. Irritation towards Spain led to discussion of a divorce with Queen Catherine. However, upon the accession of the French King <a href="/wiki/Francis_I_of_France.html" title="Francis I of France">Francis I</a> in 1515, England and France grew antagonistic, and Henry became reconciled with Ferdinand. In 1516 Queen Catherine gave birth to a girl, <a href="/wiki/Mary_I_of_England.html" title="Mary I of England">Mary</a>, encouraging Henry in the belief that he could still have a male heir despite his wife's previous failed pregnancies (one stillbirth, one miscarriage, and two short-lived infants). Ferdinand died in 1516, to be succeeded by his grandson (Queen Catherine's nephew) <a href="/wiki/Charles_V%2C_Holy_Roman_Emperor.html" title="Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor">Charles V</a>. By October 1518 Wolsey had engineered the Papacy-led Treaty of London to resemble an English triumph of foreign diplomacy, placing England at the centre of a new European alliance with the ostensible aim of repelling Moorish invasions through Spain, which was the Pope's original aim. In 1519, when Maximilian also died, Wolsey, who was by that time a <a href="/wiki/Cardinal_%28Catholicism%29.html" title="Cardinal (Catholicism)">Cardinal</a>, secretly proposed Henry as a candidate for the post of Holy Roman Emperor, though supporting the French King Francis in public. In the end, however, Charles was chosen by the <a href="/wiki/Prince-elector.html" title="Prince-elector">prince-electors</a>. The subsequent rivalry between Francis and Charles allowed Henry to act as a mediator between them. Henry came to hold the balance of power in Europe. Both Francis and Charles sought Henry's favour, the former in a dazzling and spectacular manner at the <a href="/wiki/Field_of_Cloth_of_Gold.html" title="Field of Cloth of Gold">Field of Cloth of Gold</a>, and the latter more solemnly at <a href="/wiki/Kent.html" title="Kent">Kent</a>. After 1521, however, England's influence in Europe began to wane. Henry entered into an alliance with Charles V through the <a  class="new" title="Treaty of Bruges">Treaty of Bruges</a>, and Francis I was defeated by Charles' imperial armies at the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Pavia.html" title="Battle of Pavia">Battle of Pavia</a> in February 1525. Charles' reliance on Henry subsided, as did England's power in Europe, and Henry was refused help to acquire the <a href="/wiki/Fleur-de-Lys.html" title="Fleur-de-Lys">Fleur-de-Lys</a>, despite Charles' guarantees. This lead to the <a href="/wiki/Treaty_of_Westminster.html" title="Treaty of Westminster">Treaty of Westminster</a> in 1527. Henry's interest in European affairs extended to the attack on <a href="/wiki/Martin_Luther.html" title="Martin Luther">Luther</a>'s German revolution. In 1521, he dedicated his <a href="/wiki/Defence_of_the_Seven_Sacraments.html" title="Defence of the Seven Sacraments">Defence of the Seven Sacraments</a>to Pope <a href="/wiki/Leo_X.html" title="Leo X">Leo X</a>, earning himself the title of "Defender of the Faith" (Defensor Fidei). Prior to this, his title had been "inclitissimus", meaning "most illustrious". The later title was maintained even after his break with Rome, and it is still used by the British monarch today.</p>

<h3>The King's Great Matter</h3>
<p>Henry VIII's accession was the first peaceful one England had witnessed in many years; however, the new Tudor dynasty's legitimacy could yet be tested. The English people seemed distrustful of female rulers, and Henry felt that only a male heir could secure the throne. Although Queen Catherine had been pregnant at least seven times (for the last time in 1518), only one child, the Princess Mary, had survived beyond infancy. Henry had previously been happy with mistresses, including <a href="/wiki/Mary_Boleyn.html" title="Mary Boleyn">Mary Boleyn</a> and <a href="/wiki/Elizabeth_Blount.html" title="Elizabeth Blount">Elizabeth Blount</a>, with whom he had had an illegitimate son, <a href="/wiki/Henry_Fitzroy%2C_1st_Duke_of_Richmond_and_Somerset.html" title="Henry Fitzroy, 1st Duke of Richmond and Somerset">Henry Fitzroy</a>. In 1526, when it became clear that Queen Catherine could have no further children, he began to pursue Mary Boleyn's sister, <a href="/wiki/Anne_Boleyn.html" title="Anne Boleyn">Anne</a>. Although it was almost certainly Henry's desire for a male heir that made him determined to divorce Catherine, he was very infatuated with Anne, despite her child-bearing inexperience and famously plain looks.</p>

<p>Henry's long and arduous attempt to end his marriage to Queen Catherine became known as "The King's Great Matter". Cardinal Wolsey and William Warham quietly began an inquiry into the validity of her marriage to Henry. Queen Catherine, however, testified that her marriage to Arthur, Prince of Wales had never been consummated, and that there was therefore no impediment to her subsequent marriage to Henry. The inquiry could proceed no further, and was dropped.</p>
<p>Without informing Cardinal Wolsey, Henry directly appealed to the <a href="/wiki/Holy_See.html" title="Holy See">Holy See</a>. He sent his secretary <a href="/wiki/William_Knight_%28royal_servant%29.html" title="William Knight (royal servant)">William Knight</a> to <a href="/wiki/Rome.html" title="Rome">Rome</a> to argue that Julius II's Bull was obtained by trickery, and consequently void. In addition, he requested Pope <a href="/wiki/Clement_VII.html" title="Clement VII">Clement VII</a> (1523–34) to grant a dispensation allowing him to marry any woman, even in the first degree of affinity; such a dispensation was necessary because Henry had previously had intercourse with Anne Boleyn's sister Mary. Knight found that Pope Clement VII was practically the prisoner of the Emperor Charles V. He had difficulty gaining access to the Pope, and when he finally did, he could accomplish little. Clement VII did not agree to annul the marriage, but he did grant the desired dispensation, probably presuming that the dispensation would be of no effect as long as Henry remained married to Catherine.</p>
<p>Being advised of the King's predicament, Cardinal Wolsey sent <a href="/wiki/Stephen_Gardiner.html" title="Stephen Gardiner">Stephen Gardiner</a> and <a href="/wiki/Edward_Fox_%28bishop%29.html" title="Edward Fox (bishop)">Edward Fox</a> to Rome. Perhaps fearing Queen Catherine's nephew, Charles V, Pope Clement VII initially demurred. Fox was sent back with a commission authorising the commencement of proceedings, but the restrictions imposed made it practically meaningless. Gardiner strove for a "decretal commission", which decided the points of law beforehand, and left only questions of fact to be decided. Clement VII was persuaded to accept Gardiner's proposal, and permitted Cardinal Wolsey and <a href="/wiki/Lorenzo_Cardinal_Campeggio.html" title="Lorenzo Cardinal Campeggio">Lorenzo Cardinal Campeggio</a> to try the case jointly. His decretal commission was issued in secret; it was not to be shown to anybody, and was to always remain in Cardinal Campeggio's possession. Points of law were already settled in the commission; the Papal Bull authorising Henry's marriage to Catherine was to be declared void if the grounds alleged therein were false. For instance, the Bull would be void if it falsely asserted that the marriage was absolutely necessary to maintain the Anglo-Spanish alliance.</p>
<p>Cardinal Campeggio arrived in England in 1528. Proceedings, however, were brought to a halt when the Spanish produced a second document allegedly granting the necessary dispensation. It was asserted that, a few months before he had granted papal dispensation in a public Bull, Pope Julius II had secretly granted the same in a private Brief sent to Spain. The decretal commission, however, only made mention of the Bull; it did not authorise Cardinal Campeggio and Cardinal Wolsey to determine the validity of the Brief and for eight months, the parties wrangled over its authenticity. During the spring of 1529, Henry's legal team assembled the <i>libelus</i> (the summary of Henry's royal arguments, including Lev: 2021) that was presented before the papal legates, where the following may be observed: 18 June, 1529 'The Queen was summoned to the great hall of the Black Friar's convent in London. The King, on a raised platform, sat at the upper end. Some distance away Catherine was given her place. The Cardinals, sitting lower than the King, flanked the royal presence, and near them the Archbishop of Canterbury and the bishops were given position. Doctor Richard Sampson, afterwards <a href="/wiki/Bishop_of_Chichester.html" title="Bishop of Chichester">Bishop of Chichester</a>, and Doctor <a href="/wiki/John_Bell.html" title="John Bell">John Bell</a>, afterwards <a href="/wiki/Bishop_of_Worcester.html" title="Bishop of Worcester">Bishop of Worcester</a>, led those who pleaded for the King. Representing the Queen was <a href="/wiki/John_Fisher.html" title="John Fisher">John Fisher</a> <a href="/wiki/Bishop_of_Rochester.html" title="Bishop of Rochester">Bishop of Rochester</a>, and Doctor Standish, a Gray Friar and Bishop of St. Asaph.' Following a series of deliberations, the matter was appealed to Rome, primarily after Catherine's nephew, Charles V, pressured the Pope into recalling Cardinal Campeggio and Catherine was then placed in the care of <a href="/wiki/Sir_Edmund_Bedingfield.html" title="Sir Edmund Bedingfield">Sir Edmund Bedingfield</a> at <a href="/wiki/Kimbolton_Castle.html" title="Kimbolton Castle">Kimbolton Castle</a>.</p>
<p>Angered with Cardinal Wolsey for the delay, Henry stripped him of his wealth and power. He was charged with <i><a href="/wiki/Pr%C3%A6munire.html" title="Præmunire">præmunire</a></i> — undermining the King's authority by agreeing to represent the Pope — but died on his way to trial. With Cardinal Wolsey fell other powerful ecclesiastics in England; laymen were appointed to offices such as those of <a href="/wiki/Lord_Chancellor.html" title="Lord Chancellor">Lord Chancellor</a> and Lord Privy Seal, which were formerly confined to clergymen.</p>
<p>Power then passed to <a href="/wiki/Thomas_More.html" title="Thomas More">Sir Thomas More</a> (the new Lord Chancellor), <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Cranmer.html" title="Thomas Cranmer">Thomas Cranmer</a> (the Archbishop of Canterbury), and <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Cromwell%2C_1st_Earl_of_Essex.html" title="Thomas Cromwell, 1st Earl of Essex">Thomas Cromwell, 1st Earl of Essex</a> (the <a href="/wiki/Secretary_of_State_%28United_Kingdom%29.html" title="Secretary of State (United Kingdom)">Secretary of State</a>). On <a href="/wiki/January_25.html" title="January 25">25 January</a> <a href="/wiki/1533.html" title="1533">1533</a>, Cranmer participated in the wedding of Henry and Anne Boleyn. In May, Cranmer pronounced Henry's marriage to Catherine void, and shortly thereafter declared the marriage to Anne valid. The Princess Mary was deemed illegitimate, and was replaced as heiress-presumptive by Queen Anne's new daughter, the <a href="/wiki/Elizabeth_I_of_England.html" title="Elizabeth I of England">Princess Elizabeth</a>. Catherine lost the title "Queen", and became the <a href="/wiki/Dowager.html" title="Dowager">Dowager</a> Princess of Wales (as wife of Arthur, her first husband; not as wife of Henry); Mary was no longer a "Princess", but a mere "Lady". The Dowager Princess of Wales would die of cancer in 1536.</p>
<p>Sir Thomas More, who had left office in 1532, accepted that Parliament could make Anne queen, but refused to acknowledge its religious authority. Instead, he held that the Pope remained the head of the Church. As a result, he was charged with <a href="/wiki/High_treason.html" title="High treason">high treason</a>, and beheaded in 1535. Judging him to be a <a href="/wiki/Martyr.html" title="Martyr">martyr</a>, the Catholic Church later made him a <a href="/wiki/Saint.html" title="Saint">saint</a>.</p>

<p>The Pope responded to these events by <a href="/wiki/Excommunication.html" title="Excommunication">excommunicating</a> Henry in July 1533. Considerable religious upheaval followed. Urged by <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Cromwell%2C_1st_Earl_of_Essex.html" title="Thomas Cromwell, 1st Earl of Essex">Thomas Cromwell</a>, Parliament passed several Acts that sealed the breach with Rome in the spring of 1534. The <a href="/wiki/Statute_in_Restraint_of_Appeals.html" title="Statute in Restraint of Appeals">Statute in Restraint of Appeals</a> prohibited appeals from English ecclesiastical courts to the Pope. It also prevented the Church from making any regulations without the King's consent. The <a  class="new" title="Ecclesiastical Appointments Act 1534">Ecclesiastical Appointments Act 1534</a> required the clergy to elect Bishops nominated by the Sovereign. The <a href="/wiki/Act_of_Supremacy.html" title="Act of Supremacy">Act of Supremacy 1534</a> declared that the King was "the only Supreme Head in Earth of the Church of England"; the <a href="/wiki/Treasons_Act_1534.html" title="Treasons Act 1534">Treasons Act 1534</a> made it <a href="/wiki/High_treason.html" title="High treason">high treason</a>, punishable by death, to refuse to acknowledge the King as such. The Pope was denied sources of revenue such as <a href="/wiki/Peter%27s_Pence.html" title="Peter's Pence">Peter's Pence</a>.</p>
<p>Rejecting the decisions of the Pope, Parliament validated the marriage between Henry and Anne with the <a href="/wiki/English_Act_of_Succession.html" title="English Act of Succession">Act of Succession 1534</a>. Catherine's daughter, the Lady Mary, was declared illegitimate, and Anne's <a href="/wiki/Issue_%28legal%29.html" title="Issue (legal)">issue</a> were declared next in the line of succession. All adults were required to acknowledge the Act's provisions; those who refused to do so were liable to imprisonment for life. The publisher or printer of any literature alleging that Henry's marriage to Anne was invalid was automatically guilty of high treason, and could be punished by death.</p>
<p>Opposition to Henry's religious policies was quickly suppressed. Several dissenting monks were tortured and executed. Cromwell, for whom was created the post of "<a  class="new" title="Vicegerent in Spirituals">Vicegerent in Spirituals</a>", was authorised to visit monasteries, ostensibly to ensure that they followed royal instructions, but in reality to assess their wealth. In 1536, an Act of Parliament allowed Henry to seize the possessions of the lesser monasteries (those with annual incomes of £200 or less).</p>
<p>In 1536, Queen Anne began to lose Henry's favour. After the Princess Elizabeth's birth, Queen Anne had two pregnancies that ended in either miscarriage or stillbirth. Henry VIII, meanwhile, had begun to turn his attentions to another lady of his court, <a href="/wiki/Jane_Seymour.html" title="Jane Seymour">Jane Seymour</a>. Perhaps encouraged by Thomas Cromwell, Henry had Anne arrested on charges of using <a href="/wiki/Witchcraft.html" title="Witchcraft">witchcraft</a> to trap Henry into marrying her, of having adulterous relationships with five other men, of <a href="/wiki/Incest.html" title="Incest">incest</a> with her brother <a href="/wiki/George_Boleyn%2C_Viscount_Rochford.html" title="George Boleyn, Viscount Rochford">George Boleyn, Viscount Rochford</a>, of injuring the King and of conspiring to kill him, which amounted to treason; the charges were most likely fabricated. The court trying the case was presided over by Anne's own uncle, <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Howard%2C_3rd_Duke_of_Norfolk.html" title="Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk">Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk</a>. In May 1536, the Court condemned Anne and her brother to death, either by <a href="/wiki/Execution_by_burning.html" title="Execution by burning">burning at the stake</a> or by <a href="/wiki/Decapitation.html" title="Decapitation">decapitation</a>, whichever the King pleased. The other four men Queen Anne had allegedly been involved with were to be <a href="/wiki/Drawing_and_quartering.html" title="Drawing and quartering">hanged, drawn and quartered</a>. Lord Rochford was beheaded soon after the trial ended; the four others implicated had their sentences commuted from hanging, drawing and quartering to decapitation. Anne was also beheaded soon thereafter.</p>

<p>Only days after Anne's execution in 1536, Henry married Jane Seymour. The <a href="/wiki/English_Act_of_Succession.html" title="English Act of Succession">Act of Succession 1536</a> declared Henry's children by Queen Jane to be next in the line of succession, and declared both the Lady Mary and the Lady Elizabeth illegitimate, thus excluding them. The King was granted the power to further determine the line of succession in his <a href="/wiki/Will_%28law%29.html" title="Will (law)">will</a>. Jane gave birth to a son, the <a href="/wiki/Edward_VI_of_England.html" title="Edward VI of England">Prince Edward</a>, in 1537, and died two weeks later of childbed fever. After Jane's death, the entire court mourned with Henry for some time. Henry also considered her to be his only "true" wife, being the only one who had given him the male heir he so desperately sought.</p>

<h2>Major Acts</h2>
<p>At about the same time as his marriage to Jane Seymour, Henry granted his assent to the <a href="/wiki/Laws_in_Wales_Acts_1535-1542.html" title="Laws in Wales Acts 1535-1542">Laws in Wales Act 1535</a>, which legally annexed Wales, uniting England and Wales into one nation. The Act provided for the sole use of English in official proceedings in Wales, inconveniencing the numerous speakers of the <a href="/wiki/Welsh_language.html" title="Welsh language">Welsh language</a>.</p>
<p>Henry continued with his persecution of his religious opponents. In 1536, an uprising known as the <a href="/wiki/Pilgrimage_of_Grace.html" title="Pilgrimage of Grace">Pilgrimage of Grace</a> broke out in <a href="/wiki/Northern_England.html" title="Northern England">Northern England</a>. To appease the rebellious Roman Catholics, Henry agreed to allow Parliament to address their concerns. Furthermore, he agreed to grant a general pardon to all those involved. He kept neither promise, and a second uprising occurred in 1537. As a result, the leaders of the rebellion were convicted of treason and executed. In 1538, Henry sanctioned the destruction of shrines to Roman Catholic Saints. In 1539, England's remaining monasteries were all dissolved, and their property transferred to the Crown. As a reward for his role, Thomas Cromwell was created <a href="/wiki/Earl_of_Essex.html" title="Earl of Essex">Earl of Essex</a>. <a href="/wiki/Abbot.html" title="Abbot">Abbots</a> and <a href="/wiki/Prior.html" title="Prior">priors</a> lost their seats in the <a href="/wiki/House_of_Lords.html" title="House of Lords">House of Lords</a>; only archbishops and bishops came to comprise the ecclesiastical element of the body.

<h2>Henry's Innovative Court: expansion of knowledge and creativity in the arts and sciences</h2>
<p>Henry was the quintessential Renaissance Man and his court was a mecca for scholarly and artistic innovation. The discovery of America or "The New World" set the stage for Henry's innovative attitude. Henry was among the first European rulers to learn about the true geography of the world, a revolutionary discovery. In 1507, the cartogophers <a href="/wiki/Martin_Waldseem%C3%BCller.html" title="Martin Waldseemüller">Martin Waldseemüller</a> and <a href="/wiki/Matthias_Ringmann.html" title="Matthias Ringmann">Matthias Ringmann</a> published the first "modern" map of the world, the first map to accurately depict the American Continent and a separate Atlantic and Pacific Ocean, a radical thought for the time. <sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a  title="">[1]</a></sup> This discovery created an atmosphere of exploration and discovery in the arts and sciences which Henry took full advantage of in his court and daily life.</p>

Henry was shown the above picture of <a href="/wiki/Anne_of_Cleves.html" title="Anne of Cleves">Anne of Cleves</a>.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Henry's only surviving son, the Prince Edward, Duke of Cornwall, was not a healthy child. Therefore, Henry desired to marry once again to ensure that a male could succeed him. Thomas Cromwell, 1st Earl of Essex suggested <a href="/wiki/Anne_of_Cleves.html" title="Anne of Cleves">Anne</a>, the sister of the Protestant <a href="/wiki/Duchy_of_Cleves.html" title="Duchy of Cleves">Duke of Cleves</a>, who was seen as an important ally in case of a Roman Catholic attack on England. <a href="/wiki/Hans_Holbein_the_Younger.html" title="Hans Holbein the Younger">Hans Holbein the Younger</a> was dispatched to Cleves to paint a portrait of Anne for the King. After regarding Holbein's flattering portrayal, and urged by the complimentary description of Anne given by his courtiers, Henry agreed to wed Anne. On Anne's arrival in England, Henry is said to have found her utterly unattractive, privately calling her a "Flanders Mare". She was painted totally without any signs of her pockmarked face. Nevertheless, he married her on <a href="/wiki/January_6.html" title="January 6">6 January</a> <a href="/wiki/1540.html" title="1540">1540</a>.</p>
<p>Soon thereafter, however, Henry desired to end the marriage, not only because of his personal feelings but also because of political considerations. The Duke of Cleves had become engaged in a dispute with the Holy Roman Emperor, with whom Henry had no desire to quarrel. Queen Anne was intelligent enough not to impede Henry's quest for an annulment. She testified that her marriage was never consummated. Henry was said to have come into the room each night and merely kissed his new bride on the forehead before sleeping. The marriage was subsequently annulled on the grounds that Anne had previously been contracted to marry another European nobleman. She received the title of "The King's Sister", and was granted <a href="/wiki/Hever_Castle.html" title="Hever Castle">Hever Castle</a>, the former residence of Anne Boleyn's family. The Earl of Essex, meanwhile, fell out of favour for his role in arranging the marriage, and was subsequently <a href="/wiki/Attainder.html" title="Attainder">attainted</a> and beheaded. The office of Vicegerent in Spirituals, which had been specifically created for him, was not filled, and still remains vacant.</p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/July_28.html" title="July 28">28 July</a> <a href="/wiki/1540.html" title="1540">1540</a> (the same day Lord Essex was executed) Henry married the young <a href="/wiki/Catherine_Howard.html" title="Catherine Howard">Catherine Howard</a>, Anne Boleyn's first cousin. Soon after her marriage, however, Queen Catherine may have had an affair with the courtier, <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Culpeper.html" title="Thomas Culpeper">Thomas Culpeper</a>. She also employed <a href="/wiki/Francis_Dereham.html" title="Francis Dereham">Francis Dereham</a>, who was previously informally engaged to her and had an affair with her prior to her marriage, as her secretary. Thomas Cranmer, who was opposed to the powerful Catholic Howard family, brought evidence of Queen Catherine's activities to the King's notice. Though Henry originally refused to believe the allegations, he allowed Cranmer to conduct an investigation, which resulted in Queen Catherine's implication. When questioned, the Queen could have admitted a prior contract to marry Dereham, which would have made her subsequent marriage to Henry invalid, but she instead claimed that Dereham had forced her to enter into an adulterous relationship. Dereham, meanwhile, exposed Queen Catherine's relationship with Thomas Culpeper.</p>
<p>In December 1541, Culpeper and Dereham were executed. Catherine was condemned not by a trial, but by an <a href="/wiki/Act_of_Attainder.html" title="Act of Attainder">Act of Attainder</a> passed by Parliament. The Act recited the evidence against the Queen, and Henry would have been obliged to listen to the entire text before granting the <a href="/wiki/Royal_Assent.html" title="Royal Assent">Royal Assent</a>. Because "the repetition of so grievous a Story and the recital of so infamous a crime" in the King's presence "might reopen a Wound already closing in the Royal Bosom", a special clause permitting Commissioners to grant the Royal Assent on the King's behalf was inserted in the Act. This method of granting the Royal Assent had never been used before, but, in later reigns, it came to replace the traditional personal appearance of the Sovereign in Parliament.</p>
<p>Catherine's marriage was annulled shortly before her execution. As was the case with Anne Boleyn, Catherine Howard could not have technically been guilty of adultery, as the marriage was officially null and void from the beginning. Again, this point was ignored, and Catherine was executed on <a href="/wiki/February_13.html" title="February 13">13 February</a> <a href="/wiki/1542.html" title="1542">1542</a>. She was only about eighteen years old at the time.</p>
<p>Henry married his last wife, the wealthy widow <a href="/wiki/Catherine_Parr.html" title="Catherine Parr">Catherine Parr</a>, in 1543. She argued with Henry over religion; she was a Protestant, but Henry remained a Catholic. This behaviour almost led to her undoing, but she saved herself by a show of submissiveness. She helped reconcile Henry with his first two daughters, the Lady Mary and the Lady Elizabeth. In 1544, an Act of Parliament put them back in the line of succession after the Prince Edward, Duke of Cornwall, though they were still deemed illegitimate. The same Act allowed Henry to determine further succession to the throne in his will.</p>
<p>A <a href="/wiki/Mnemonic.html" title="Mnemonic">mnemonic</a> for the fates of Henry's wives is "divorced, beheaded, died, divorced, beheaded, survived". An alternative version is "King Henry the Eighth, to six wives he was wedded: One died, one survived, two divorced, two beheaded". The <a href="/wiki/Doggerel.html" title="Doggerel">doggerel</a>, however, may be misleading. Firstly, Henry was never divorced from any of his wives; rather, his marriages to them were annulled. Secondly, four marriages — not two — ended in annulments. The marriages to Anne Boleyn and Catherine Howard were annulled shortly before their executions.</p>

<small>King Henry VIII died in the Palace of Whitehall in 1547</small></div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Later in life, Henry was grossly overweight, with a waist measurement of 54 inches (137 cm), and possibly suffered from <a href="/wiki/Gout.html" title="Gout">gout</a>. The well known theory that he suffered from <a href="/wiki/Syphilis.html" title="Syphilis">syphilis</a> was first promoted approximately 100 years after his death. More recent support for this idea has come from a greater understanding of the disease and has led to the suggestion that <a href="/wiki/Edward_VI.html" title="Edward VI">Edward VI</a>, <a href="/wiki/Mary_I_of_England.html" title="Mary I of England">Mary I</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Elizabeth_I.html" title="Elizabeth I">Elizabeth I</a> all displayed symptoms characteristic of <a href="/wiki/Congenital_syphilis.html" title="Congenital syphilis">congenital syphilis</a>. Henry's increased size dates from a <a href="/wiki/Jousting.html" title="Jousting">jousting</a> accident in 1536. He suffered a thigh wound which not only prevented him from taking exercise, but also gradually became ulcerated and may have indirectly led to his death, which occurred on <a href="/wiki/January_28.html" title="January 28">28 January</a> <a href="/wiki/1547.html" title="1547">1547</a> at the <a href="/wiki/Palace_of_Whitehall.html" title="Palace of Whitehall">Palace of Whitehall</a>. He died on what would have been his father's 90th birthday. Henry VIII was buried in <a href="/wiki/St._George%27s_Chapel%2C_Windsor.html" title="St. George's Chapel, Windsor">St George's Chapel</a> in <a href="/wiki/Windsor_Castle.html" title="Windsor Castle">Windsor Castle</a>, next to his wife Jane Seymour. Almost a hundred years later <a href="/wiki/Charles_I_of_England.html" title="Charles I of England">Charles I</a> would also be buried in his grave. Within a little more than a decade after his death, all three of his children sat on the English throne, and were his only descendants.</p>
<p>It is suggested that Henry VIII had another child, Richard Edwardes. Richard's mother was Henry's mistress, Agnes Blewitt. Agnes was married at the time to William Edwardes and Richard took the name of his step-father out of shame. Henry never actually acknowledged Richard, but it is said that they were very close. Agnes had two other sons with William Edwardes, but Richard was the only one who she said was the son of Henry VIII. The descendants of Richard Edwardes are the only direct descendants of Henry VIII.</p>
<p>Under the <a href="/wiki/English_Act_of_Succession.html" title="English Act of Succession">Act of Succession</a> 1544, Henry's only surviving son, Edward, inherited the Crown, becoming <a href="/wiki/Edward_VI_of_England.html" title="Edward VI of England">Edward VI</a>. Edward was the first <a href="/wiki/Protestant.html" title="Protestant">Protestant</a> monarch to rule England. Since Edward was only nine years old at the time, he could not exercise actual power. Henry's will designated sixteen <a href="/wiki/Executor.html" title="Executor">executors</a> to serve on a council of regency until Edward reached the age of eighteen. The executors chose <a href="/wiki/Edward_Seymour%2C_1st_Duke_of_Somerset.html" title="Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset">Edward Seymour, 1st Earl of Hertford</a>, Jane Seymour's elder brother, to be <a href="/wiki/Lord_Protector.html" title="Lord Protector">Lord Protector</a> of the Realm. In the event of a death without children, Edward was to be succeeded (in default of his issue) by Henry VIII's daughter by Catherine of Aragon, the <a href="/wiki/Mary_I_of_England.html" title="Mary I of England">Lady Mary</a>. If the Lady Mary did not have children, she was to be succeeded by his daughter by Anne Boleyn, the Lady Elizabeth. Finally, if the Lady Elizabeth also did not have children, she was to be followed by the descendants of Henry VIII's deceased sister, <a href="/wiki/Mary_Tudor_%28queen_consort_of_France%29.html" title="Mary Tudor (queen consort of France)">Mary Tudor</a>, <a href="/wiki/Earl_of_Suffolk.html" title="Earl of Suffolk">Duchess of Suffolk</a>.</p>

<h2>Legacy</h2>
<p>Together with <a href="/wiki/Alfred_the_Great.html" title="Alfred the Great">Alfred the Great</a>, Henry is traditionally called one of the founders of the <a href="/wiki/Royal_Navy.html" title="Royal Navy">Royal Navy</a>. There are good reasons for this - his reign featured some naval warfare and, more significantly, large royal investment in shipbuilding (including a few spectacular '<a href="/wiki/Great_ship.html" title="Great ship">great ships</a>' such as the <a href="/wiki/Mary_Rose.html" title="Mary Rose">Mary Rose</a>), dockyards (such as <a href="/wiki/HMNB_Portsmouth.html" title="HMNB Portsmouth">HMNB Portsmouth</a>) and naval innovations (eg the use of <a href="/wiki/Cannon.html" title="Cannon">cannon</a> onboard ship - although <a href="/wiki/Archers.html" title="Archers">archers</a> were still deployed on medieval-style <a href="/wiki/Forecastle.html" title="Forecastle">forecastles</a> and bowcastles as the ship's primary armament on large ships, or co-armament where cannon were used). However, it is a misnomer since Henry did not bequeath to his immediate successors a '<a href="/wiki/Navy.html" title="Navy">navy</a>' in the sense of a formalised organisation with structures, ranks, formalised munitioning structures etc, but only in the sense of a set of ships (albeit some spectacular ones). <a href="/wiki/Elizabeth_I_of_England.html" title="Elizabeth I of England">Elizabeth I</a> still had to cobble together a set of privately-owned ships to fight off the <a href="/wiki/Spanish_Armada.html" title="Spanish Armada">Spanish Armada</a> and in the former, formal sense the modern British <a href="/wiki/Navy.html" title="Navy">navy</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Royal_Navy.html" title="Royal Navy">Royal Navy</a>, is largely a product of the Anglo-Dutch naval rivalry of the seventeenth century.</p>
<p>By his break with <a href="/wiki/Roman_Catholic_Church.html" title="Roman Catholic Church">Rome</a>, Henry incurred the threat of a large-scale French or Spanish invasion. To guard against this he strengthened existing coastal defence fortresses (such as <a href="/wiki/Dover_Castle.html" title="Dover Castle">Dover Castle</a> and, also at <a href="/wiki/Dover%2C_Kent.html" title="Dover, Kent">Dover</a>, <a  class="new" title="Moat Bulwark">Moat Bulwark</a> and <a  class="new" title="Archcliffe Fort">Archcliffe Fort</a> - he personally visited for a few months to supervise, as is commemorated in the modern exhibition in <a href="/wiki/Dover_Castle.html" title="Dover Castle">Dover Castle</a>'s keep there). He also built a chain of new 'castles' (in fact, large bastioned and garrisoned gun batteries) along Britain's southern coast from <a href="/wiki/East_Anglia.html" title="East Anglia">East Anglia</a> to <a href="/wiki/Cornwall.html" title="Cornwall">Cornwall</a>, largely built of material gained from the <a href="/wiki/Dissolution_of_the_Monasteries.html" title="Dissolution of the Monasteries">demolition of monasteries</a>. These were also known as Henry VIII's <a href="/wiki/Device_Forts.html" title="Device Forts">Device Forts</a>.</p>

<h2>Style and arms</h2>
<p>Henry VIII was the first English monarch to regularly use the style "Majesty", though the alternatives "Highness" and "Grace" were also used from time to time.</p>
<p>Several changes were made to the royal style during his reign. Henry originally used the style "Henry the Eighth, by the Grace of <a href="/wiki/God.html" title="God">God</a>, <a href="/wiki/List_of_monarchs_of_England.html" title="List of monarchs of England">King of England</a>, <a href="/wiki/English_Kings_of_France.html" title="English Kings of France">France</a> and <a href="/wiki/Lord_of_Ireland.html" title="Lord of Ireland">Lord of Ireland</a>". In 1521, pursuant to a grant from <a href="/wiki/Pope_Leo_X.html" title="Pope Leo X">Pope Leo X</a> rewarding a book by Henry attacking <a href="/wiki/Martin_Luther.html" title="Martin Luther">Martin Luther</a> and defending <a href="/wiki/Roman_Catholic_Church.html" title="Roman Catholic Church">Catholicism</a>, the royal style became "Henry the Eighth, by the Grace of God, King of England and France, <a href="/wiki/Fidei_Defensor.html" title="Fidei Defensor">Defender of the Faith</a> and Lord of Ireland". After the breach with <a href="/wiki/Rome.html" title="Rome">Rome</a>, <a href="/wiki/Pope_Paul_III.html" title="Pope Paul III">Pope Paul III</a> rescinded the grant of the title "Defender of the Faith", but an <a href="/wiki/Act_of_Parliament.html" title="Act of Parliament">Act of Parliament</a> declared that it remained valid.</p>
<p>In 1535, Henry added the "supremacy phrase" to the royal style, which became "Henry the Eighth, by the Grace of God, King of England and France, Defender of the Faith, Lord of Ireland and of the Church of England in <a href="/wiki/Earth.html" title="Earth">Earth</a> Supreme Head". In 1536, the phrase "of the <a href="/wiki/Church_of_England.html" title="Church of England">Church of England</a>" changed to "of the Church of England and also of <a href="/wiki/Church_of_Ireland.html" title="Church of Ireland">Ireland</a>".</p>
<p>In 1541, Henry had the Irish Parliament change the title "Lord of Ireland" to "<a href="/wiki/King_of_Ireland.html" title="King of Ireland">King of Ireland</a>" after being advised that many <a href="/wiki/Irish_ethnicity.html" title="Irish ethnicity">Irish people</a> regarded the <a href="/wiki/Pope.html" title="Pope">Pope</a> as the true head of their country, with the Lord acting as a mere representative. The reason the Irish regarded the pope as their overlord was because Ireland had originally been given to the English King <a href="/wiki/Henry_II_of_England.html" title="Henry II of England">Henry II</a> by <a href="/wiki/Pope_Adrian_IV.html" title="Pope Adrian IV">Pope Adrian IV</a> in the twelfth century as a feudal territory under papal overlordship. The meeting of Irish Parliament that proclaimed Henry VIII King of Ireland was the first meeting attended by the Gaelic Irish chieftains as well as the Anglo-Irish aristocrats. The style "Henry the Eighth, by the Grace of God, King of England, France and Ireland, Defender of the Faith and of the Church of England and also of Ireland in Earth Supreme Head" remained in use until the end of Henry's reign.</p>
<p>Henry's <a href="/wiki/Motto.html" title="Motto">motto</a> was <i>Coeur Loyal</i> (true heart) and he had this embroidered on his clothes in the form of a heart symbol and with the word 'loyall'. His emblem was the <a href="/wiki/Tudor_rose.html" title="Tudor rose">Tudor rose</a> and the Beaufort portcullis.</p>
<p>Henry VIII's <a href="/wiki/Heraldry.html" title="Heraldry">arms</a> were the same as those used by his predecessors since <a href="/wiki/Henry_IV_of_England.html" title="Henry IV of England">Henry IV</a>: <i>Quarterly, Azure three <a href="/wiki/Fleur-de-lis.html" title="Fleur-de-lis">fleurs-de-lys</a> Or (for <a href="/wiki/France.html" title="France">France</a>) and Gules three lions passant guardant in pale Or (for <a href="/wiki/England.html" title="England">England</a>)</i>.</p>
