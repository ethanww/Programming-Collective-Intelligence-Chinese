<p><b>NetWare</b> is a <a href="/wiki/Network_operating_system.html" title="Network operating system">network operating system</a> developed by <a href="/wiki/Novell%2C_Inc..html" title="Novell, Inc.">Novell, Inc.</a> It initially used <a href="/wiki/Cooperative_multitasking.html" title="Cooperative multitasking">cooperative multitasking</a> to run various services on a <a href="/wiki/Personal_computer.html" title="Personal computer">PC</a>, and the network protocols were based on the archetypal <a href="/wiki/Xerox_XNS.html" title="Xerox XNS">Xerox XNS</a> <a href="/wiki/Protocol_stack.html" title="Protocol stack">stack</a>.</p>
<p>NetWare established the dominant position in the market in the early and middle 1990s by developing its XNS-derived <a href="/wiki/IPX/SPX.html" title="IPX/SPX">IPX/SPX</a> protocol as the <a href="/wiki/Local_area_network.html" title="Local area network">local area network</a> (LAN) standard. At the end of the 1990s, with <a href="/wiki/Internet.html" title="Internet">Internet</a> connectivity booming, the Internet's <a href="/wiki/TCP/IP.html" title="TCP/IP">TCP/IP</a> protocol became dominant on LANs also. Novell had introduced limited TCP/IP support in NetWare v3.x (circa 1992) and v4.x (circa 1995), consisting mainly of FTP services and UNIX-style LPR/LPD printing (available in NetWare v3.x), and a Novell-developed webserver (in NetWare v4.x). Native TCP/IP support (for the client file and print services normally associated with NetWare) was introduced in NetWare v5.0 (released in 1998). While some attribute Novell's delay in adopting TCP/IP as its native protocol to the loss of NetWare's dominance, it's more accurate to say that Novell allowed itself to be outmarketed.</p>
<p>NetWare evolved from a very simple concept: one or more dedicated servers were connected to the network, and disk space was shared in the form of <i>volumes</i>. Clients running <a href="/wiki/MS-DOS.html" title="MS-DOS">MS-DOS</a> would run a special <a href="/wiki/Terminate_and_Stay_Resident.html" title="Terminate and Stay Resident">Terminate and Stay Resident</a> (TSR) program that allowed them to <i>map</i> a volume as if it were a local hard disk. Clients had to log in to a server in order to be allowed to map volumes, and access could be restricted according to the login name. Similarly, they could connect to shared printers on the dedicated server, and print as if the printer was connected locally.</p>
<p>While early NetWare systems did entirely trust all modules (any misbehaving module could bring the whole system down), it was very stable. There are reports of Netware servers running for years without any human intervention.</p>

<h3>Early years</h3>
<p>Netware was based on the consulting work by <a href="/wiki/SuperSet.html" title="SuperSet">SuperSet</a> Software, a group founded by the friends <a href="/wiki/Drew_Major.html" title="Drew Major">Drew Major</a>, Dale Neibauer, Kyle Powell and later Mark Hurst. This work was based on their classwork at <a href="/wiki/Brigham_Young_University.html" title="Brigham Young University">Brigham Young University</a> in Provo, Utah, starting in October <a href="/wiki/1981.html" title="1981">1981</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/1983.html" title="1983">1983</a> <a href="/wiki/Raymond_Noorda.html" title="Raymond Noorda">Raymond Noorda</a> engaged the work by the SuperSet team. The team was originally assigned to create a <a href="/wiki/CP/M.html" title="CP/M">CP/M</a> <a  class="new" title="Disk sharing">disk sharing</a> system to help network the CP/M hardware that Novell was selling at the time. The team was privately convinced that CP/M was a doomed platform and instead came up with a successful file sharing system for the newly introduced IBM-compatible <a href="/wiki/Personal_computer.html" title="Personal computer">PC</a>. They also wrote an application called <a href="/wiki/Snipes.html" title="Snipes">Snipes</a>, a text-mode game and used it to test the new network and demonstrate its capabilities. Snipes was the first network application ever written for a commercial personal computer, and it is recognized as one of the precursors of many popular multi-player games such as <a href="/wiki/Doom.html" title="Doom">Doom</a> and <a href="/wiki/Quake.html" title="Quake">Quake</a>. <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.textmodegames.com/download/snipes.html">[1]</a></p>
<p>This <a href="/wiki/Network_operating_system.html" title="Network operating system">Network operating system</a> (NOS) was later called <strong class="selflink">Novell NetWare</strong>. NetWare was based on the <a href="/wiki/NetWare_Core_Protocol.html" title="NetWare Core Protocol">NetWare Core Protocol</a> (NCP), which is a packet-based protocol that enables a client to send requests to and receive replies from a NetWare server. Initially, NCP was directly tied to the IPX/SPX protocol, which meant that natively, NetWare could only communicate using IPX/SPX.</p>
<p>The first product to bear the NetWare name was released in 1983. It was called Netware 68 (aka <a href="/wiki/Novell_S-Net.html" title="Novell S-Net">S-Net</a>); it ran on the <a href="/wiki/Motorola.html" title="Motorola">Motorola</a> <a href="/wiki/68000.html" title="68000">68000</a> processor and used a Star network topology. It was replaced in 1985 with NetWare 86 version 1.5, which was written for the <a href="/wiki/Intel_8086.html" title="Intel 8086">Intel 8086</a>. After the <a href="/wiki/Intel_80286.html" title="Intel 80286">Intel 80286</a> processor came out, Novell released NetWare 286 in 1986. The same happened with the release of the <a href="/wiki/Intel_80386.html" title="Intel 80386">Intel 80386</a>; Novell released NetWare 386 in 1989. Later, Novell consolidated the numbering of their NetWare releases, with NetWare 286 becoming NetWare 2.x, and NetWare 386 becoming NetWare 3.x.</p>
<p>NetWare version 2 was notoriously difficult to configure; any change required a re-linking the <a href="/wiki/Kernel_%28computer_science%29.html" title="Kernel (computer science)">kernel</a> and a reboot of the system, requiring at least 20 diskette swaps. NetWare was administered using text-based utilities such as SYSCON. The file system used by NetWare 2 was <a href="/wiki/NetWare_File_System.html" title="NetWare File System">NetWare File System</a> 286, or NWFS 286, supporting volumes of up to 256 MB.</p>
<p>NetWare 2 already implemented a number of features inspired by mainframe and minicomputer systems that were not available in other operating systems of the day. The <i>System Fault Tolerance (SFT)</i> features included standard read-after-write verification (SFT-I) with on-the-fly bad block re-mapping (at the time, disks did not have that feature built in) and software <a href="/wiki/RAID1.html" title="RAID1">RAID1</a> (disk mirroring, SFT-II). The Transaction Tracking System (TTS) optionally protected files against incomplete updates. For single files, this required only a file attribute to be set. Transactions over multiple files and controlled roll-backs were possible by programming to the TTS <a href="/wiki/API.html" title="API">API</a>.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: NetWare 3.x">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="NetWare_3.x" id="NetWare_3.x"></a></p>
<h3>NetWare 3.x</h3>
<p>NetWare version 3 eased development and administration by modularization. Each functionality was controlled by a software module called a <a href="/wiki/NetWare_Loadable_Module.html" title="NetWare Loadable Module">NetWare Loadable Module</a> (NLM) loaded either at startup or when it was needed. It was then possible to add functionality such as anti-virus software, backup software, database and web servers, long name support (standard filenames were limited to 8 characters plus a three letter extension, matching <a href="/wiki/MS-DOS.html" title="MS-DOS">MS-DOS</a>) or <a href="/wiki/Apple_Macintosh.html" title="Apple Macintosh">Macintosh</a> style files. NetWare continued to be administered using text-based utilities. The file system introduced by Netware 3.x and used by default until Netware 5.x was Netware File System 386, or <a href="/wiki/Netware_file_system.html" title="Netware file system">NWFS 386</a>, which significantly extended volume capacity (1 TB, 4 GB files) and could handle volume segments spanning multiple physical disk drives.</p>
<p>Initially, NetWare used <i>Bindery services</i> for authentication. This was a stand-alone database system where all user access and security data resided individually on each server. When an infrastructure contained more than one server, users had to log-in to each of them individually, and each server had to be configured with the list of all allowed users. "NetWare Name Services" was a product that allowed user data to be extended across multiple servers, and the Windows "Domain" concept is functionally equivalent to NetWare v3.x Bindery services with NetWare Name Services added on (e.g. a 2-dimensional database, with a flat namespace and a static schema).</p>
<p>For a while, Novell also marketed an <a href="/wiki/Original_equipment_manufacturer.html" title="Original equipment manufacturer">OEM</a> version of NetWare 3, called <b>Portable NetWare</b>, together with OEMs such as <a href="/wiki/Hewlett-Packard.html" title="Hewlett-Packard">Hewlett-Packard</a>, <a href="/wiki/Digital_Equipment_Corporation.html" title="Digital Equipment Corporation">DEC</a> and <a href="/wiki/Data_General.html" title="Data General">Data General</a>, who ported Novell source code to run on top of their Unix operating systems. Portable NetWare met only with marginal success.</p>
<p>In the 3.x era, Novell introduced its first high-availability clustering system, named <b>NetWare SFT-III</b>, which allowed a logical server to be completely mirrored to a separate physical machine. Implemented as a <a href="/wiki/Shared_nothing_architecture.html" title="Shared nothing architecture">shared-nothing</a> cluster, under SFT-III the OS was logically split into an interrupt-driven <i>I/O engine</i> and the event-driven OS core. The I/O engines serialized their interrupts (disk, network etc.) into a combined event stream that was fed to two identical copies of the system engine through a fast (typically 100 Mbit/s) inter-server link. Because of its non-preemptive nature, the OS core, stripped of non-deterministic I/O, behaves deterministically, like a large <a href="/wiki/Finite_state_machine.html" title="Finite state machine">finite state machine</a>. The outputs of the two system engines were compared to ensure proper operation, and two copies fed back to the I/O engines. Using the existing SFT-II software RAID funcionality present in the core, disks could be mirrored between the two machines without special hardware. The two machines could be separated as far as the server-to-server link would permit. In case of a server or disk failure, the surviving server could take over client sessions transparently after a short pause since it had full state information and did not, for example, have to re-mount the volumes - a process that NetWare was notoriously slow at. Incidentially, SFT-III was the first NetWare version able to make use of <a  class="new" title="Symmetrical multiprocessing">SMP</a> hardware - the I/O engine could optionally be run on its own CPU. NetWare SFT-III, being ahead of its time in several ways, was a mixed success. It should also be noted that the modern incarnation of NetWare's clustering, Novell Cluster Services (introduced in NetWare v5.0), is very different from SFT-III.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: NetWare 4.x">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="NetWare_4.x" id="NetWare_4.x"></a></p>
<h3>NetWare 4.x</h3>
<p>Version 4 introduced the <a href="/wiki/Novell_Directory_Services.html" title="Novell Directory Services">Novell Directory Services</a> (NDS), based on X.500, which replaced the Bindery with a global <a href="/wiki/Directory_service.html" title="Directory service">directory service</a> where the infrastructure was described and managed in a single place. Additionally, NDS provided an extensible schema, allowing the introduction of new object types. This allowed a single user authentication to NDS to govern access to any server in the directory tree structure. Users could therefore access network resources no matter on which server they resided, although user license counts were still tied to individual servers. (Large enterprises could opt for a license model giving them essentially unlimited per-server users if they let Novell audit their total user count.)</p>
<p>Version 4 also introduced a number of useful tools and features, such as transparent compression at file system level and RSA public/private encryption.</p>
<p>NetWare released version 4.11, also called intraNetWare, which included many enhancements that made the operating system easier to install, easier to operate, faster, and more stable. It also included the first fully 32-bit client for <a href="/wiki/Microsoft_Windows.html" title="Microsoft Windows">Microsoft Windows</a>-based workstations, <a href="/wiki/Symmetric_multiprocessing.html" title="Symmetric multiprocessing">SMP</a> support and the NetWare Administrator (NWADMIN or NWADMN32), a GUI-based administration tool for NetWare.</p>
<p>By this time, NetWare was still tied to IPX/SPX by the NCP reliance on that protocol, but Novell started to acknowledge the demand for TCP/IP with NetWare 4.11 by including tools and utilities that made it easier to create intranets and link networks to the Internet. Novell bundled handy tools, such as the IPX/IP gateway, to ease the connection between IPX workstations and IP networks. It also began integrating Internet technologies and support through features such as a natively hosted <a href="/wiki/Web_server.html" title="Web server">Web server</a>.</p>
<p>During this time Novell also realized the importance of leveraging its directory service, NDS, by tying their other products into the directory. Their e-mail system, <a href="/wiki/Novell_GroupWise.html" title="Novell GroupWise">GroupWise</a>, was integrated with NDS, and Novell released many other directory-enabled products such as <a href="/wiki/Novell_ZENworks.html" title="Novell ZENworks">ZENworks</a> and <a  class="new" title="BorderManager">BorderManager</a>.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: NetWare 5.x">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="NetWare_5.x" id="NetWare_5.x"></a></p>
<h3>NetWare 5.x</h3>
<p>With the release of NetWare 5 in <a href="/wiki/October_1998.html" title="October 1998">October 1998</a>, Novell finally acknowledged the prominence of the Internet by switching its primary NCP interface from the <a href="/wiki/IPX/SPX.html" title="IPX/SPX">IPX/SPX</a> network protocol to <a href="/wiki/TCP/IP.html" title="TCP/IP">TCP/IP</a>. IPX/SPX was still supported, but the emphasis shifted to TCP/IP. Other new features were:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/wiki/Novell_Storage_Services.html" title="Novell Storage Services">Novell Storage Services</a> (NSS), a new file system to replace the traditional <a href="/wiki/NetWare_file_system.html" title="NetWare file system">NetWare file system</a> - which was still supported</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Java_virtual_machine.html" title="Java virtual machine">Java virtual machine</a> for NetWare</li>
<li>Novell Distributed Print Services (NDPS)</li>
<li>ConsoleOne, a new Java-based GUI administration console</li>
<li>directory-enabled <a href="/wiki/Public_key_infrastructure.html" title="Public key infrastructure">Public key infrastructure</a> services (PKIS)</li>
<li>directory-enabled <a href="/wiki/Domain_Name_System.html" title="Domain Name System">DNS</a> and <a href="/wiki/Dynamic_Host_Configuration_Protocol.html" title="Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol">DHCP</a> servers</li>
<li>support for Storage Area Networks (SANs)</li>
<li>Novell Cluster Services (NCS)</li>
<li>5-user version of Oracle 8i</li>
</ul>
<p>The Cluster Services were a major advance over SFT-III, as NCS does not require specialized hardware or identical server configurations.</p>
<p>NetWare 5 was released during a time when NetWare market share dropped precipitously; many companies and organizations were replacing their NetWare servers with servers running <a href="/wiki/Microsoft.html" title="Microsoft">Microsoft</a>'s <a href="/wiki/Windows_NT.html" title="Windows NT">Windows NT</a> operating system. Novell also released their last upgrade to the NetWare 4 operating system, NetWare 4.2.</p>
<p>NetWare 5.1 was released in <a href="/wiki/January_2000.html" title="January 2000">January 2000</a>, shortly after its predecessor. It introduced a number of useful tools, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/wiki/WebSphere.html" title="WebSphere">IBM WebSphere Application Server</a></li>
<li>NetWare Management Portal (later renamed Novell Remote Manager), web-based management of the operating system</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol.html" title="File Transfer Protocol">FTP</a>, <a href="/wiki/Network_News_Transfer_Protocol.html" title="Network News Transfer Protocol">NNTP</a> and <a href="/wiki/Streaming_media.html" title="Streaming media">streaming media</a> servers</li>
<li>NetWare Web Search Server</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/WebDAV.html" title="WebDAV">WebDAV</a> support</li>
</ul>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: NetWare 6.x">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="NetWare_6.x" id="NetWare_6.x"></a></p>
<h3>NetWare 6.x</h3>
<p>NetWare 6 was released in <a href="/wiki/October_2001.html" title="October 2001">October 2001</a>.NetWare 6 has a simplified licensing scheme based on users, not servers. This reduces licensing costs and allows unlimited connections per user.</p>
<p>Other changes, new features and improvements included:</p>
<ul>
<li>enhanced <a href="/wiki/Symmetric_multiprocessing.html" title="Symmetric multiprocessing">SMP</a> support - up to 32 processors per server</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/IFolder.html" title="IFolder">iFolder</a> - location- and platform-independent access to local files by automatic intelligent synchronization of the local iFolder directory with the iFolder server</li>
<li>NetStorage - access to personal files through a standard web browser</li>

<h3>Novell Open Enterprise Server</h3>
<p>In 2003, Novell announced the successor product to NetWare: <a href="/wiki/Open_Enterprise_Server.html" title="Open Enterprise Server">Open Enterprise Server</a> (OES). First released in <a href="/wiki/March_2005.html" title="March 2005">March 2005</a>, OES completes the separation of the services traditionally associated with NetWare (e.g. Directory Services, file-and-print) from the platform underlying the delivery of those services. OES is essentially a set of applications (eDirectory, NetWare Core Protocol services, iPrint, NDPS, etc.) that can run atop either a <a href="/wiki/Linux.html" title="Linux">Linux</a> or a NetWare kernel platform. Clustered OES implementations can even migrate services from Linux to NetWare and back again, making Novell one of the very few vendors to offer a multi-platform clustering solution.</p>
<p>Consequent to Novell's acquisitions of <a href="/wiki/Ximian.html" title="Ximian">Ximian</a> and <a href="/wiki/SuSE.html" title="SuSE">SuSE</a>, a German Linux distributor, it is widely observed that Novell may be moving away from NetWare and shifting its focus towards Linux. Officially though, Novell <a  class="external text" title="http://www.novell.com/products/netware/vp_interview.html">denies these claims</a> and says it will focus on both NetWare and Linux. Indeed, practically all of Novell's products run on, at a minimum, both Linux and NetWare, and some (such as eDirectory, GroupWise and Identity Manager) also run on many other platforms.</p>

<p><a name="Performance" id="Performance"></a></p>
<h2>Performance</h2>
<p>NetWare dominated the network operating system (NOS) market from the mid-80s through the mid- to late-90s due to its extremely high performance relative to other NOS technologies. Most benchmarks during this period demonstrated a 5:1 to 10:1 performance advantage over products from Microsoft, Banyan, and others. One benchmark that was especially interesting compared NetWare 3.x running <a href="/wiki/Network_File_System.html" title="Network File System">NFS</a> services over TCP/IP (not NetWare's native IPX protocol) to an expensive, dedicated Auspex NFS server and a SCO Unix server running NFS service. NetWare NFS outperformed both 'native' NFS systems and clocked in with a 2:1 performance advantage over SCO Unix NFS on the same hardware!</p>
<p>There were several reasons for NetWare's performance.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: File service instead of disk service">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="File_service_instead_of_disk_service" id="File_service_instead_of_disk_service"></a></p>
<h3>File service instead of disk service</h3>
<p>At the time NetWare was first developed, nearly all LAN storage was based on the disk server model. This meant that if a client computer wanted to read a particular block from a particular file it would have to issue the following requests across the relatively slow LAN:</p>
<ol>
<li>Read first block of directory</li>
<li>Continue reading subsequent directory blocks until the directory block containing the information on the desired file was found, could be many directory blocks</li>
<li>Read through multiple file entry blocks until the block containing the location of the desired file block was found, could be many directory blocks</li>
<li>Read the desired data block</li>
</ol>
<p>NetWare, since it was based on a file service model interacted with the client at the file API level:</p>
<ol>
<li>Send file open request (if this hadn't already been done)</li>
<li>Send a request for the desired data from the file</li>
</ol>
<p>All of the work of searching the directory to figure out where the desired data was physically located on the disk was performed at high speed locally on the server. By the mid-1980s, most NOS products had shifted from the disk service to the file service model. Today, the disk service model is making a comeback, see <a href="/wiki/SAN.html" title="SAN">SAN</a>.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Aggressive caching">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Aggressive_caching" id="Aggressive_caching"></a></p>
<h3>Aggressive caching</h3>
<p>From the start, NetWare was designed to be used on servers with copious amounts of RAM. The entire file allocation table (FAT) was read into RAM when a volume was mounted, thereby requiring a minimum amount of RAM proportional to online disk space; adding a disk to a server would often require a RAM upgrade as well. Unlike most competing <a href="/wiki/Network_operating_system.html" title="Network operating system">network operating systems</a> prior to Windows NT, NetWare automatically used all otherwise unused RAM for caching active files, employing delayed write-backs to facilitate re-ordering of disk requests (<a href="/wiki/Elevator_algorithm.html" title="Elevator algorithm">elevator seeks</a>). An unexpected shutdown could therefore corrupt data, making an <a href="/wiki/Uninterruptible_power_supply.html" title="Uninterruptible power supply">uninterruptible power supply</a> practically a mandatory part of a server installation.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Efficiency of NetWare Core Protocol (NCP)">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Efficiency_of_NetWare_Core_Protocol_.28NCP.29" id="Efficiency_of_NetWare_Core_Protocol_.28NCP.29"></a></p>
<h3>Efficiency of NetWare Core Protocol (NCP)</h3>
<p>Most network protocols in use at the time NetWare was developed didn't trust the network to deliver messages. A typical client file read would work something like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Client sends read request to server</li>
<li>Server acknowledges request</li>
<li>Client acknowledges acknowledgement</li>
<li>Server sends requested data to client</li>
<li>Client acknowledges data</li>
<li>Server acknowledges acknowledgement</li>
</ol>
<p>In contrast, NCP was based on the idea that networks worked perfectly most of the time, so the reply to a request served as the acknowledgement. Here is an example of a client read request using this model:</p>
<ol>
<li>Client sends read request to server</li>
<li>Server sends requested data to client</li>
</ol>
<p>All requests contained a sequence number, so if the client didn't receive a response within an appropriate amount of time it would re-send the request with the same sequence number. If the server had already processed the request it would resend the cached response, if it had not yet had time to process the request it would send a 'positive acknowledgement' which meant, "I received your request but I haven't gotten to it yet so don't bug me". The bottom line to this 'trust the network' approach was a 2/3 reduction in network traffic and the associated latency.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Non-preemptive OS designed for network services">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Non-preemptive_OS_designed_for_network_services" id="Non-preemptive_OS_designed_for_network_services"></a></p>
<h3>Non-preemptive OS designed for network services</h3>
<p>One of the raging debates of the 90s was whether it was more appropriate for network file service to be performed by a software layer running on top of a general purpose operating system, or by a special purpose operating system. NetWare was a special purpose operating system, not a timesharing OS. It was written from the ground up as a platform for client/server processing services. Initially it focused on file and print services, but later demonstrated its flexibility by running database, email, web and other services as well. It also performed efficiently as a router, supporting IPX, TCP/IP, and Appletalk, though it never offered the flexibility of a 'hardware' router.</p>
<p>In 4.x and earlier versions, NetWare did not support <a href="/wiki/Preemption.html" title="Preemption">preemption</a>, <a href="/wiki/Virtual_memory.html" title="Virtual memory">virtual memory</a>, <a href="/wiki/GUI.html" title="GUI">graphical user interfaces</a> etc. Processes and services running under the NetWare OS were expected to be cooperative, that is to process a request and return control to the OS in a timely fashion. On the down side, this trust of application processes to manage themselves could lead to a misbehaving application bringing down the server.</p>
<p>By comparison, general purpose operating systems such as <a href="/wiki/Unix.html" title="Unix">Unix</a> or <a href="/wiki/Microsoft_Windows.html" title="Microsoft Windows">Microsoft Windows</a> were based on an interactive, time-sharing model where competing programs would consume all available resources if not held in check by the OS. Such environments operated by preemption, memory virtualization, etc., generating significant overhead because there were never enough resources to do everything every application desired. These systems improved over time as network services shed their “application” stigma and moved deeper into the kernel of the “general purpose” OS, but they never equaled the efficiency of NetWare.</p>
<p>Probably the single greatest reason for Novell's success during the 80's and 90's was the efficiency of NetWare compared to general purpose operating systems. However, as microprocessors increased in power, efficiency became less and less of an issue and with the introduction of the Pentium processor, NetWare's performance advantage began to be outweighed by the complexity of managing and developing applications for the NetWare environment.</p>
