			<p><b>Chariot racing</b> was one of the most popular <a href="/wiki/Ancient_Greece.html" title="Ancient Greece">ancient Greek</a> and <a href="/wiki/Roman_Empire.html" title="Roman Empire">Roman</a> <a href="/wiki/Sport.html" title="Sport">sports</a>. Often dangerous to both drivers and horses, the sport generated strong spectator enthusiasm comparable to modern-day interest in <a href="/wiki/Motor_sports.html" title="Motor sports">motor sports</a>. Some of the organizational aspects of chariot racing also paralleled current practices in professional sports. In the Roman form of chariot racing, teams represented different groups of financial backers and sometimes competed for the services of particularly skilled drivers. These teams became the focus of intense support among spectators and occasional disturbances broke out between followers of different teams. The conflicts sometimes became politicized, as the sport began to transcend the races themselves and started to affect society overall. This helps explain why Roman and later <a href="/wiki/Byzantine_empire.html" title="Byzantine empire">Byzantine</a> emperors took control of the teams and appointed many officials to oversee them. The sport faded in importance after the fall of the Roman Empire in the west, surviving only for a time in the Byzantine Empire.</p>

<h2>Early chariot racing</h2>
<p>It is unknown exactly where chariot <a href="/wiki/Racing.html" title="Racing">racing</a> began, but it may have been as old as <a href="/wiki/Chariot.html" title="Chariot">chariots</a> themselves. It is known from artistic evidence on <a href="/wiki/Pottery.html" title="Pottery">pottery</a> that the sport existed in the <a href="/wiki/Mycenaean.html" title="Mycenaean">Mycenaean</a> world, but the first <a href="/wiki/Literature.html" title="Literature">literary</a> reference to a chariot race is the one described by <a href="/wiki/Homer.html" title="Homer">Homer</a> in Book 23 of the <a href="/wiki/Iliad.html" title="Iliad">Iliad</a>, at the funeral games of <a href="/wiki/Patroclus.html" title="Patroclus">Patroclus</a>. The participants in this race were <a href="/wiki/Diomedes.html" title="Diomedes">Diomedes</a>, <a href="/wiki/Eumelus.html" title="Eumelus">Eumelus</a>, <a href="/wiki/Antilochus.html" title="Antilochus">Antilochus</a>, <a href="/wiki/Menelaus.html" title="Menelaus">Menelaus</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Meriones.html" title="Meriones">Meriones</a>. The race, which was one lap around the stump of a tree, was won by Diomedes, who received a <a href="/wiki/Slavery.html" title="Slavery">slave</a> woman and a <a href="/wiki/Cauldron.html" title="Cauldron">cauldron</a> as his prize. A chariot race was also said to be the event that founded the <a href="/wiki/Olympic_Games.html" title="Olympic Games">Olympic Games</a>; according to one legend, King <a href="/wiki/Oenomaus.html" title="Oenomaus">Oenomaus</a> challenged his daughter <a href="/wiki/Hippodamia.html" title="Hippodamia">Hippodamia</a>'s suitors to a race, but was defeated by <a href="/wiki/Pelops.html" title="Pelops">Pelops</a>, who founded the Games in honour of his victory.</p>

<h2>The Olympic Games</h2>
<p>In the <a href="/wiki/Ancient_Olympic_Games.html" title="Ancient Olympic Games">ancient Olympic Games</a>, as well as the other <a href="/wiki/Panhellenic_Games.html" title="Panhellenic Games">Panhellenic Games</a>, there were both four-horse (<i>tethrippon</i>) and two-horse (<i>synoris</i>) chariot races, which were essentially the same aside from the number of horses. The chariot racing event was first added to the Olympics in 680 BC (but was not, in reality, the founding event). The race was begun by a procession into the <a href="/wiki/Hippodrome.html" title="Hippodrome">hippodrome</a>, while a herald announced the names of the drivers and owners. The hippodrome at Olympia was about 600 yards long and 300 yards wide, and up to 60 chariots could race at one time (though in practice the number was probably much lower). It was located beneath a hill, and underneath a vast river, which provided standing room for possibly as many as 10,000 spectators. A race consisted of twelve laps around the hippodrome, with sharp turns around the posts at either end. Various mechanical devices were used, including the starting gates (<i>hyspleges</i>, sing. <i>hysplex</i>) which were lowered to start the race. According to <a href="/wiki/Pausanias_%28geographer%29.html" title="Pausanias (geographer)">Pausanias</a> these were invented by the architect <a  class="new" title="Kleoitas">Kleoitas</a>, and staggered so that the chariots on the outside began the race earlier than those on the inside. The race did not actually begin properly until the final gate was opened, at which point each chariot would be more-or-less lined up alongside each other, although the ones that had started on the outside would have been travelling faster than the ones in the middle. Other mechanical devices known as the "eagle" and the "dolphin" were raised to signify that the race had begun, and were lowered as the race went on to signify the number of laps remaining. These were probably bronze carvings of those animals, set up on posts at starting line.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>Unlike the other Olympic events, charioteers did not perform in the nude (see <a href="/wiki/Nudity_in_sports.html" title="Nudity in sports">nudity in sports</a>), probably for safety reasons because of the dust kicked up by the horses and chariots, and the likelihood of bloody crashes. Racers wore a garment called a <i>xystis</i>. It fell to the ankles and was fastened high at the waist with a plain belt. Two straps that crossed high at the upper back, prevented the <i>xystis</i> from "ballooning" during the race.</p>
<p>Like modern <a href="/wiki/Jockey.html" title="Jockey">jockeys</a>, chariot racers were chosen for their lightness, but also needed to be tall, so they were frequently teenagers.</p>
<p>The chariots themselves were modified war chariots, essentially wooden carts with two wheels and an open back, although chariots were by this time no longer used in battle. The charioteer's feet were held in place, but the cart rested on the axle, so the ride was bumpy. The most exciting part of the chariot race, at least for the spectators, was the turns at the ends of the hippodrome. These turns were very dangerous and often deadly. If a chariot had not already been knocked over by an opponent before the turn, it might be overturned or crushed (along with the horses and driver) by the other chariots as they went around the post. Deliberately running into an opponent to cause him to crash was technically illegal, but nothing could be done about it (at Patroclus' funeral games, <a href="/wiki/Antilochus.html" title="Antilochus">Antilochus</a> in fact causes <a href="/wiki/Menelaus.html" title="Menelaus">Menelaus</a> to crash in this way), and crashes were likely to happen by accident anyway.</p>
<p>The chariot race was not as prestigious as the <i><a href="/wiki/Stadion.html" title="Stadion">stadion</a></i> (the foot race), but it was more important than other equestrian events such as racing on horseback, which were dropped from the Olympic Games very early on. In Mycenaean times the driver and owner would have been the same person, and therefore the winning driver received the prize. However, by the time of the Panhellenic Games, the owners usually had slaves who did the actual driving, and it was the owner who was awarded the prize. <a  class="new" title="Arsecilas">Arsecilas</a>, the king of <a href="/wiki/Cyrene%2C_Libya.html" title="Cyrene, Libya">Cyrene</a>, won the chariot race at the <a href="/wiki/Pythian_Games.html" title="Pythian Games">Pythian Games</a> in 462 BC, when his slave driver was the only one to finish the race. In 416 BC the <a href="/wiki/Athens.html" title="Athens">Athenian</a> general <a href="/wiki/Alcibiades.html" title="Alcibiades">Alcibiades</a> had seven chariots in the race, one of which won; obviously he could not have been racing all seven chariots himself. <a href="/wiki/Philip_II_of_Macedon.html" title="Philip II of Macedon">Philip II of Macedon</a> also won an Olympic chariot race in an attempt to prove he was not a <a href="/wiki/Barbarian.html" title="Barbarian">barbarian</a>, though if he had driven the chariot himself he would likely have been considered even lower than a barbarian. This rule also meant that women could technically win the race, despite the fact that women were not allowed to participate in or even watch the Games. This happened rarely, but a notable example is the <a href="/wiki/Sparta.html" title="Sparta">Spartan</a> <a href="/wiki/Cynisca.html" title="Cynisca">Cynisca</a>, daughter of <a href="/wiki/Agesilaus_II.html" title="Agesilaus II">Agesilaus II</a>, who won the chariot race twice.</p>

<p>Chariot racing was also an event at other games in the Greek world, and was the most important event at the <a href="/wiki/Panathenaic_Games.html" title="Panathenaic Games">Panathenaic Games</a> in <a href="/wiki/Athens.html" title="Athens">Athens</a>. At these games, the winner of the four-horse chariot race was given 140 <a href="/wiki/Amphora.html" title="Amphora">amphorae</a> of <a href="/wiki/Olive_oil.html" title="Olive oil">olive oil</a>, an extremely expensive prize, as this was more oil than an athlete would ever need in his career. Most of it was probably sold to other athletes. There was another form of chariot racing at the Panathenaic Games, known as the <i>apobotai</i> or the <i>anabotai</i>. This involved jumping out of the chariot and running alongside for some distance (the <i>anabotai</i>); the <i>apobotai</i> apparently also including jumping back into the chariot after running alongside it. In these races there was a second driver who held the reins while the first driver jumped out, but of course neither of these were considered the winner. The first chariot over the line would win, no matter if the driver was in the chariot or out.</p>

<h2>Roman chariot racing</h2>
<p>The Romans probably borrowed chariot racing from the <a href="/wiki/Etruscans.html" title="Etruscans">Etruscans</a>, who themselves borrowed it from the Greeks, but the Romans were also influenced directly by the Greeks especially after they conquered mainland Greece in 146 BC.</p>
<p>According to Roman legend chariot racing was used by Romulus just after he founded Rome in 753 B.C. as a way of distracting the Sabine men. Whilst the Sabines were enjoying the spectacle Romulus and his men seized and carried off the <a href="/wiki/Sabine.html" title="Sabine">Sabine</a> women. This event is more commonly known as "<a href="/wiki/The_Rape_of_the_Sabine_Women.html" title="The Rape of the Sabine Women">The Rape of the Sabine Women</a>."</p>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/Ancient_Rome.html" title="Ancient Rome">ancient Rome</a> the main centre of chariot racing was the <a href="/wiki/Circus_Maximus.html" title="Circus Maximus">Circus Maximus</a> in the valley between <a href="/wiki/Palatine_Hill.html" title="Palatine Hill">Palatine Hill</a> and <a href="/wiki/Aventine_Hill.html" title="Aventine Hill">Aventine Hill</a>, which could seat 250,000 people. The Circus probably dated back to the time of the Etruscans, but it was rebuilt by <a href="/wiki/Julius_Caesar.html" title="Julius Caesar">Julius Caesar</a> around 50 BC so that it had a length of about 600 metres and a width of about 225 metres. One end of the track was more open than the other, as this was where the chariots lined up to begin the race. The Romans used a series of gates known as <i>carceres</i>, an equivalent to the Greek <i>hysplex</i>. These were staggered in the same way as the <i>hysplex</i>, but they were slightly different because Roman racing tracks also had a median (the <i>spina</i>) in the centre of the track. The starting positions had to be lined up on one side of the <i>spina</i>, rather than across the entire track as they were in Greece. When the chariots were lined up the emperor (or whoever was hosting the races, if they were not in Rome) dropped a cloth known as a <i>mappa</i>, signalling the beginning of the race.</p>
<p>Once the race had begun, the chariots could move in front of each other in an attempt to cause their opponents to crash into the <i>spina</i>. The <i>spina</i> had "eggs", similar to the "dolphins" of the Greek races, which may have dropped into a channel of water that ran along the top of the <i>spina</i> to signify the number of laps remaining. The <i>spina</i> eventually became very elaborate, with statues and obelisks and other forms of art, so that the spectators often could not see the chariots on the other side (but they seem to have thought this was more suspenseful and exciting). At either end of the <i>spina</i> there were turning posts (<i>metae</i>), and spectacular crashes took place there, as in the Greek races. Crashes in which the chariot was destroyed and the charioteer and horses incapacitated were known as a <i>naufragium</i>, also the <a href="/wiki/Latin.html" title="Latin">Latin</a> word for a shipwreck.</p>

<p>The race itself was much like its Greek counterpart, although there were eventually dozens of races every day, sometimes for hundreds of consecutive days each year. However, a race consisted of only 7 laps (and later 5 laps, so that there could be even more races per day), instead of the 12 laps of the Greek race. The Roman style was also more money-oriented; racers were professionals and there was widespread betting among spectators. There were four-horse chariots (<i><a href="/wiki/Quadriga.html" title="Quadriga">quadrigae</a></i>) and two-horse chariots (<i>bigae</i>), but the four-horse races were more important. In rare cases, if a driver wanted to show off his skill, he could use up to 10 horses, although this was extremely impractical. The Roman drivers also wore helmets and other protective gear, unlike the Greeks, and they wrapped the reins around their arms, while the Greeks held the reins in their hands. Because of this the Romans had a much harder time letting go of the reins after a crash, so they could be dragged around the circus until they freed themselves. They carried knives to cut the reins in such a situation. The most famous and best reconstruction of a Roman chariot race can be seen in the 11-Academy-Awards movie <i><a href="/wiki/Ben-Hur_%281959_film%29.html" title="Ben-Hur (1959 film)">Ben-Hur</a></i>.</p>
<p>Another important difference was that the charioteers themselves, the <i>aurigae</i>, were considered to be the winners, although they were usually also slaves (as in the Greek world). They received a wreath of laurel leaves, and probably some money; if they won enough races they could buy their freedom. Drivers could become celebrities throughout the Empire simply by surviving, as the life expectancy of a charioteer was not very high. One such celebrity driver was <a href="/wiki/Scorpus.html" title="Scorpus">Scorpus</a>, who won over 2000 races before being killed in a collision at the <i>meta</i> when he was about 27 years old. The horses, too, could become celebrities, but their life expectancy was also low. The Romans kept detailed statistics of the names, breeds, and pedigrees of famous horses.</p>
<p>Seats in the Circus were free for the poor, who by the time of the Empire had little else to do, as they were no longer involved in political or military affairs as they had been in the <a href="/wiki/Roman_Republic.html" title="Roman Republic">Republic</a>. The wealthy could pay for shaded seats where they had a better view, and they probably also spent much of their times betting on the races. The emperor's palace was located close to the Hippodrome, and he would often watch the games as well. This was one of the few opportunities for the general population to view their leader. Julius Caesar frequently watched the races specifically so that the public could see him, although he apparently was not very interested as he usually brought something to read.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Nero.html" title="Nero">Nero</a> was interested in the races almost to the exclusion of everything else. He was a driver himself, and won the chariot racing event at the Olympic Games, which were still being held in the Roman era. Under Nero the major racing factions began to develop. The four most important factions were the Reds, Blues, Greens, and Whites. They had existed before Nero, probably as friends and patrons of the various stables that produced the racehorses. Nero, however, subsidized them so that they grew almost beyond his control. Each team could have up to three chariots each in a race. Members of the same team often collaborated with each other against the other teams, for example to force them to crash into the <i>spina</i> (a legal and encouraged tactic). Drivers could switch teams, much like athletes can be traded to different teams today.</p>
<p>According to the disapproving <a href="/wiki/Tertullian.html" title="Tertullian">Tertullian</a> (<i>De spectaculis</i> 9.5), there were originally just two factions, White and Red, sacred to winter and summer respectively. Writing near the beginning of the third century, he wrote that the Reds were dedicated to <a href="/wiki/Mars.html" title="Mars">Mars</a>, the Whites to the <a href="/wiki/Zephyr.html" title="Zephyr">Zephyrs</a>, the Greens to <a href="/wiki/Mother_Earth.html" title="Mother Earth">Mother Earth</a> or spring, and the Blues to the sky and sea or autumn. <a href="/wiki/Domitian.html" title="Domitian">Domitian</a> created two new factions, the Purples and Golds, but by the 3rd century only the Blues and Greens had any importance.</p>
<p>There were many other <a href="/wiki/Circus_%28building%29.html" title="Circus (building)">circuses</a> throughout the Roman Empire; there was even another major circus outside Rome, the <a href="/wiki/Circus_of_Maxentius.html" title="Circus of Maxentius">Circus of Maxentius</a>. There were major circuses at <a href="/wiki/Alexandria.html" title="Alexandria">Alexandria</a> and <a href="/wiki/Antioch.html" title="Antioch">Antioch</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Herod_the_Great.html" title="Herod the Great">Herod the Great</a> built four circuses in <a href="/wiki/Judaea.html" title="Judaea">Judaea</a>. In the 4th century <a href="/wiki/Constantine_I_%28emperor%29.html" title="Constantine I (emperor)">Constantine I</a> built a circus in his new capital at <a href="/wiki/Constantinople.html" title="Constantinople">Constantinople</a>.</p>

<p>Like many other aspects of the Roman world, chariot racing continued in the <a href="/wiki/Byzantine_Empire.html" title="Byzantine Empire">Byzantine Empire</a>, although the Byzantines did not keep as many records and statistics as the Romans did. Constantine preferred chariot racing to <a href="/wiki/Gladiator.html" title="Gladiator">gladiatorial</a> combat, which he considered a vestige of <a href="/wiki/Paganism.html" title="Paganism">paganism</a>. The Olympic Games were eventually ended by the devoutly Christian emperor <a href="/wiki/Theodosius_I.html" title="Theodosius I">Theodosius I</a> in 394, in a move to suppress paganism and promote Christianity, but chariot racing continued to be popular. The <a href="/wiki/Hippodrome_of_Constantinople.html" title="Hippodrome of Constantinople">Hippodrome of Constantinople</a> (really a Roman circus, not the open space that the original Greek hippodromes were) was connected to the emperor's palace and the Church of <a href="/wiki/Hagia_Sophia.html" title="Hagia Sophia">Hagia Sophia</a>, allowing spectators to view the emperor as they had in Rome.</p>
<p>There is not much evidence that the chariot races were subject to bribes or other forms of cheating in the Roman Empire. In the Byzantine Empire there seems to have been more cheating; <a href="/wiki/Justinian_I.html" title="Justinian I">Justinian I</a>'s reformed legal code prohibits drivers from placing curses on their opponents, but otherwise there does not seem to have been any mechanical tampering or bribery.</p>
<p>Chariot racing in the Byzantine Empire also included the Roman racing clubs, but by this time only the Blues and Greens were important. One of the most famous charioteers, <a href="/wiki/Porphyrius.html" title="Porphyrius">Porphyrius</a>, was a member of both the Blues and the Greens at various times in 5th century. However, they were now more than simply sports teams. They gained influence in military, political, and theological matters, with, for example, the Greens tending towards <a href="/wiki/Monophysitism.html" title="Monophysitism">Monophysitism</a> and the Blues remaining Orthodox. They also developed in something like street gangs, responsible for robberies and murders. Although they had rioted as far back as the reign of Nero, the rioting throughout the 5th century and into the 6th century culminated in the <a href="/wiki/Nika_riots.html" title="Nika riots">Nika riots</a> of 532 during the reign of Justinian, which began when some of their members were arrested for murder. Chariot racing seems to have declined after this incident, but they had in any case become much too expensive for the racing teams, or even the emperors, to pay for.</p>
<p>The Hippodrome in Constantinople remained a sanctuary for the emperors, until it was sacked during the <a href="/wiki/Fourth_Crusade.html" title="Fourth Crusade">Fourth Crusade</a> in 1204. During the looting, the Crusaders removed the <a href="/wiki/Horses_of_Saint_Mark.html" title="Horses of Saint Mark">Horses of Saint Mark</a>, four bronze originally part of a monument depicting a <i><a href="/wiki/Quadriga.html" title="Quadriga">quadrigae</a></i> built by <a href="/wiki/Constantine_I_%28emperor%29.html" title="Constantine I (emperor)">Constantine the Great</a>. The horses still exist, but they are now at <a href="/wiki/San_Marco_di_Venezia.html" title="San Marco di Venezia">St. Mark's Cathedral</a> in <a href="/wiki/Venice.html" title="Venice">Venice</a>.</p>
