<p>IBM's history dates back decades before the development of electronic computers when it developed <a href="/wiki/Punch_card.html" title="Punch card">punched card</a> data processing equipment. It originated as the <a  class="new" title="Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation">Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation</a> (CTR), which was incorporated on <a href="/wiki/June_15.html" title="June 15">June 15</a>, <a href="/wiki/1911.html" title="1911">1911</a> in <a href="/wiki/Endicott%2C_New_York.html" title="Endicott, New York">Endicott, New York</a> a few miles west of <a href="/wiki/Binghamton%2C_New_York.html" title="Binghamton, New York">Binghamton</a>.</p>
<p>CTR was formed through a <a href="/wiki/Merger.html" title="Merger">merger</a> of three separate corporations: Tabulating Machine Corporation (founded <a href="/wiki/1896.html" title="1896">1896</a> in <a href="/wiki/Washington_D.C..html" title="Washington D.C.">Washington D.C.</a>), the Computing Scale Corporation (founded <a href="/wiki/1901.html" title="1901">1901</a> in <a href="/wiki/Dayton%2C_Ohio.html" title="Dayton, Ohio">Dayton, Ohio</a>) and the International Time Recording Company (founded <a href="/wiki/1900.html" title="1900">1900</a> in Endicott, NY). The president of the Tabulating Machine Corporation at that time was <a href="/wiki/Herman_Hollerith.html" title="Herman Hollerith">Herman Hollerith</a>, who had founded the company. The key person behind the merger was financier <a href="/wiki/Charles_Flint.html" title="Charles Flint">Charles Flint</a>, who brought together the founders of the three companies to propose a merger and remained a member of the board of CTR until his retirement in <a href="/wiki/1930.html" title="1930">1930</a>.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a  title="">[11]</a></sup></p>

<h3>Early Education &amp; R&amp;D <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://futureobservatory.dyndns.org/9081.htm">[1]</a></h3>
<p>It was in the middle of the Depression, in 1932, that Watson formally established an Education Department at Endicott, then IBM's main plant; with the first three engineers graduating in 1934. By 1937 almost half the 32,000 factory employees at Endicott were enrolled; in 52 classes, studying 24 different subjects. Tool-making was an especially important skill being taught, but even the factory supervisors and executives had to attend its 'Supervisor's' School.</p>
<p>The education facilities were conveniently placed near the 'Homestead', the clubhouse which was the hub of IBM's leisure complex; as well as being the hotel for customers attending education. It was a near idyllic location for doing business and, according to his son Tom Jr., Thomas Watson Sr. - who had a permanent suite of rooms there - said it was his favorite IBM location.</p>
<p>The earliest research, at Endicott, focused on product needs, indeed largely on quality control, rather than the more fundamental investigations which were later, in the 1980s, to earn IBM two consecutive Nobel prizes for Physics. For example, the paper-testing laboratory was then especially important; where, by 1937, Endicott was producing up to 10 million cards a day. But a 'Methods Research Department' which, in the context of punched cards, was effectively the start of IBM's 'software development' (albeit that it then revolved around the wiring of plug-boards rather than computer programs), was started at much the same time.</p>

<h2>World War II <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://futureobservatory.dyndns.org/9087.htm">[2]</a></h2>
<p>During World War II 274 mobile IBM punched card units followed the front‑line controlling the logistics of supply; and, in the process, exposing a new generation of users to the benefits of data processing. In any case IBM's business, in common with that of many other manufacturers, grew substantially on the back of the increased economic activity generated by the war effort. From a revenue of $34.8 million in 1939 sales climbed to a high of $143.3 million in 1944, before falling off slightly at the end of the war.</p>
<p>Towards the end of the war the research arms of the services started to develop requirements for the first true computers; the nuclear weapons industry perhaps being the most significant potential customer. In terms of commercial applications, however, the Bletchley Park code‑breaking work in England was very much a side event; though it did produce Alan Turing as one of the great theoreticians of computing. IBM's contribution, in 1943, was the Mark I, an electro‑mechanical monster 51 feet long by 8 feet high and containing 530 miles of wiring! It cost $200,000 (plus a donation of another $100,000 to cover operating costs) and was installed at Harvard.</p>
<p>Even with this example IBM did not really get into computing in its modern form. It built a further electro‑mechanical marvel, the Mark II, the IBM Selective Sequence Electronic Calculator (SSEC) with 21,000 relays and 13,000 vacuum tubes, which it grandly installed in its headquarters in 1948. The real action was, however, elsewhere at the University of Pennsylvania where the ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator And Computer) team were developing the first electronic computer; unveiled at the University of Pennsylvania in 1946. Even in 1949, despite Watson's alarm at the progress shown by the UNIVAC (which had emerged from the ENIAC project), IBM was only just starting to design its first family of true, electronic computers; the 701. At that stage it was probably at least two years behind UNIVAC; which was subsequently, in 1950, sold to IBM's competitor, Remington Rand, which a year later also purchased the other group working in the field, Engineering Research Associates (ERA), to become the undisputed leader in computing..</p>

<h2>IBM 360 <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://futureobservatory.dyndns.org/9034.htm">[3]</a></h2>
<p>Only 18 months after work had started on the 1401 <a href="/wiki/Tom_Watson_Jr.html" title="Tom Watson Jr">Tom Watson Jr</a> set the labs to work on what was to become the 360 range of computers. This was perhaps IBM's biggest gamble, and one on a scale that has rarely been equalled by governments let alone by companies. It was a decision on the part of Tom Watson Jr that can only be described as truly courageous.</p>
<p>The initial R &amp; D reportedly cost $500 million, but this was merely the tip of the iceberg. The total investment, including six new plants built around the world (with IBM switching from being the world's largest purchaser of electronic components to being the world's largest producer of these!), was estimated to have cost $5 billion over 4 years. It was indeed, at the time, the most costly privately financed programme in history; according to Tom Wise it cost more than the Manhattan (atomic bomb) project up to the time of Hiroshima. It eventually absorbed 2,000 programmers; when problems with the 'leading edge' software caused the delivery schedule to slip near disastrously. It also added 50,000 to IBM's total workforce world-wide.</p>
<p>Most adventurously of all it was incompatible with the preceding ranges of machines; at a time when the Honeywell 200 had been announced as the first 'plug compatible' (that is a machine that simulated, or 'copied', the 1400) to which the customers' existing programs could be easily transferred. It was the last time IBM could afford the luxury, for by the time of the launch of the subsequent 370 computer the customer base was too valuable, and too tightly locked in to the technology, for any such risk to be commercially viable.</p>
<p>It is understandable that Bob O Evans, then head of IBM Federal Systems Division, described it at the time to reporter Tom Wise as "You bet your company...". He did though add the much less publicised rider "....but it was a damn good risk and a lot less risk that it would have been to do anything else, or do nothing at all".</p>
<p>The gamble was of course a success, and made IBM virtually unassailable until the 1990s. The 360 range was announced on April 7th 1964 and the first 360/40 installed (albeit late; but with the production problems resolved) a year later in April 1965.</p>
<p>Although the project was Tom Watson Jr's greatest business achievement as reported outside IBM it was actually masterminded by his heir apparent, T V Learson, with Gene Amdahl (covering technical matters and later to found one of IBM's least welcome rivals), Albert Williams (who had the critical, and unenviable, task of keeping Wall Street happy with the massive investment programme), and Dick Watson (handling the production plan). It was later claimed that TVR (as Learson was known) used the predictably impossible task of bringing in the production on schedule to destroy Dick as his competitor (though Dick probably wasn't helped by his reputation for hard drinking and occasionally literally falling down on the job; as he reportedly did at one Family Dinner at the Hursley Labs).</p>

<p>IBM's success in the mid-<a href="/wiki/1960s.html" title="1960s">1960s</a> led to inquiries as to IBM antitrust violations by the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice.html" title="United States Department of Justice">U.S. Department of Justice</a>, which filed a complaint for the case <i>U.S. v. IBM</i> in the <a href="/wiki/United_States_District_Court_for_the_Southern_District_of_New_York.html" title="United States District Court for the Southern District of New York">United States District Court for the Southern District of New York</a>, on <a href="/wiki/January_17.html" title="January 17">January 17</a>, <a href="/wiki/1969.html" title="1969">1969</a>. The suit alleged that IBM violated the Section 2 of the <a href="/wiki/Sherman_Act.html" title="Sherman Act">Sherman Act</a> by <a href="/wiki/Monopoly.html" title="Monopoly">monopolizing</a> or attempting to monopolize the general purpose electronic digital computer system market, specifically computers designed primarily for business. Litigation continued until 1983, and had a significant impact on the company's practices. In 1973, IBM was ruled to have created a monopoly via its 1956 patent-sharing agreement with Sperry-Rand in the decision of <i><a href="/wiki/Honeywell_v._Sperry_Rand.html" title="Honeywell v. Sperry Rand">Honeywell v. Sperry Rand</a></i>, a decision that invalidated the patent on the <a href="/wiki/ENIAC.html" title="ENIAC">ENIAC</a>.</p>
<p>At the time of the launch of the 360 range IBM was under considerable competitive pressure from the large 6600 computers offered by Control Data. To counter this IBM announced, in August 1964, the 360/91, followed over succeeding months by a number of replacement machines, Only a few of these were ever produced (reportedly only 25 machines; and at a loss of $110 million) and in 1967 IBM stopped selling them. [<a  class="external autonumber" title="http://futureobservatory.dyndns.org/9034.htm">[4]</a>]</p>
<p>Control Data, understandably, was less than happy with this spoiling strategy (as they saw it) and claimed these were only 'fighting machines' (such as had been used by Watson Sr. at NCR) purely designed to keep Control Data out. It is possible, as I for one believe, that IBM simply outstripped its own capabilities and just couldn't meet its promises; even IBM does not usually contemplate a $110 million loss to fund a fighting machine. The jury is still out, however, for although CDC instituted an anti‑trust suit in December 1968 a settlement was reached in 1973. From IBM's point of view, the most important aspect of this settlement was that CDC was required to destroy its index to the millions of documents were about to be also used by the Department of Justice; and without which their case was to be much less powerful! [<a  class="external autonumber" title="http://futureobservatory.dyndns.org/9034.htm">[5]</a>]</p>
<p>The history of the CDC anti‑trust suit, and the host of copycat suits by other companies that it spawned is worthy of a book in itself (and indeed there is at least one such book). Ultimately, though, it adds little to one's knowledge of IBM as a whole. Of the literally millions of pages (to be precise 66 million pages and more than 2,500 depositions) that have been archived in the case, those that have been abstracted - apparently almost exclusively by the prosecution in the case - were designed to show IBM in a bad light. More important, from the point of view of this book, they were not representative of how IBM then normally did business; no matter how reprehensible, or even illegal, each individual item so reported might be considered to be. [<a  class="external autonumber" title="http://futureobservatory.dyndns.org/9034.htm">[6]</a>]</p>
<p>The most important impact, though, was that it possibly prompted the US Justice Department in January 1969 (at the very end of Johnson's presidency) to mount its own anti‑trust suit. This one was not so easily settled. It consumed the efforts of hundreds of lawyers and probably hundreds of millions of dollars over a decade and a half; until it was eventually withdrawn in January 1982. It is arguable that some of the most dubious of its practices were stimulated by the various cases brought against it. For instance, one of its covert offices, not listed in any IBM directory but located in Victoria Street in London during the early 1980s (and staffed by a very high-powered group of IBM managers), probably really was set up - as IBM claimed - to ensure that IBM might fully meet the requirements of the EEC. On the other hand, the - possibly apocryphal - reports of that group's covert activities at the time did seem to suggest that there was at least some 'laundering' of IBM's key files (as more recently happened to some of Enron's) to ensure that there was no evidence of IBM's past transgressions, rather than that there were no transgressions per se! [<a  class="external autonumber" title="http://futureobservatory.dyndns.org/9034.htm">[7]</a>]</p>
<p>The key effect of this, though, was that, for a critical decade and a half, IBM was under the constant scrutiny of the US government; which was ready to pounce on the slightest transgression, and almost continuously threatened break‑up on the lines of Standard Oil earlier in the century. The ethical standards promoted by Tom Jr might possibly have faded into obscurity under the pressure of normal business priorities. Under the scrutiny of the US Justice Department, on the other hand, they became the very backbone of IBM. [<a  class="external autonumber" title="http://futureobservatory.dyndns.org/9034.htm">[8]</a>]</p>
<p>Thus, the anti‑trust suit, which has usually been portrayed as a threat to IBM, was in perverse reality a critical element in its success; and indeed was essential to the development of the later company, founded more on philosophies than profits. The paradoxes did not cease with the departure of Thomas J Watson Sr and the succession of TV Learson and <a href="/wiki/Frank_Cary.html" title="Frank Cary">Frank Cary</a>. [<a  class="external autonumber" title="http://futureobservatory.dyndns.org/9034.htm">[9]</a>]</p>
<p>It is perhaps not coincidental that soon after the pressure of 'anti-trust' had been removed in 1982 (compounded by the fact that there was no longer a member of the Watson dynasty in power to oversee its moral values) IBM's results (for 1985/1986) deteriorated.</p>

These companies built their business on the principle of purchasing IBM equipment and then leasing it over a longer period, typically 7 years, than that used by IBM to calculate its own rental charges. IBM typically used a four year pay back period; though this later dropped to three years to persuade customers to purchase outright. The difference allowed the leasing companies to undercut IBM, to obtain the business and at the same time make a substantial profit. The main problem for IBM, though, was the loss of control over its customer base. The leasing companies clearly owed no loyalty to IBM and would just as happily sell anyone else's equipment; and some of them even started to market their own lines of hardware. The embarrassment for IBM was relatively short lived (at least in IBM terms), since the leasing companies pursuing the most aggressive pricing policies contained the seeds of their own destruction. When IBM announced its new range earlier than expected, the financial equation that was the foundation of their business disappeared and their empires crumbled. The moral for them (and also for Lloyds which foolishly underwrote much of their business) was that 'borrowing long' and 'lending short' can also be a gamble.</p>
<p>The 'seven dwarfs' (including Univac, Honeywell, Burroughs, and NCR) of the 1960's, and the later 'mini' vendors such as DEC and Hewlett Packard, had by then found their own special niches where they were not in direct competition with IBM. They typically offered, instead, expertise and products that IBM could not offer profitably. As such they were tolerated, and in some cases even welcomed, by IBM.</p>

<p><a name="Plug_Compatible" id="Plug_Compatible"></a></p>
<h3>Plug Compatible</h3>
<p>The second, more important, problem was that of the 'plug compatible' manufacturers. In the 1970's these became IBM's most direct form of competition; on the principle if you can't beat IBM then look just like it (and charge a lower price). These plug took sales directly from where it hurt IBM most. Imitation may be the sincerest form of flattery, but where it cut into sales and profits IBM could not afford to be sanguine about it.</p>
<p>At first the competition was in the area of 'peripherals'. In particular companies such as Memorex and Telex challenged IBM's hold on storage products (disk, tape and memory). IBM's reaction, to shake off these gnats, was simply to let loose its most advanced technology and suck its competitors into a crushing race to produce ever more advanced equipment. It was a race that only IBM could win; which it well knew.</p>
<p>This defense did, indeed, hold good for the best part of a decade. It was only when IBM started to lose its way in the second half of the 1980s that new competition was able to beat IBM in these areas; and it did it by IBM's own approach, offering better products!</p>
<p>The remaining problem, of plug compatible CPU's, was found to be much less susceptible to easy solution, and at the end of the 1970s became a major threat to IBM's dominance. Paradoxically the individual who was the catalyst for this was one of those most responsible for the success of the 360. After managing the technical side of the 360 launch, Gene Amdahl eventually left IBM. According to most reports this was because he was unhappy with the hybrid technology it was using; he wanted to move on immediately to LSI (Large Scale Integration). On the other hand, according to Taiyu Kobayashi it started with a conflict over the number of models in the 370 range and deepened when IBM closed his research facility. Whatever the reason, he then set out, in 1970, to beat IBM at its own game of leading edge CPU technology, and succeeded brilliantly. He chose, however, not to produce a new 'architecture'; but instead to duplicate the 360 architecture he knew so well (having designed large parts of it). The resulting plug compatible CPU's operated just like IBM's except that the hardware inside was more advanced; and cheaper. Worse, from IBM's point of view, was that having seemingly been in contact with Fujitsu since 1969 (before he left IBM), he finally (in 1972) allowed that company to take a 24% share of his new company. This was described by some as a 'bail-out', since at that time he was very short of funding. In return he gave Fujitsu access to some of the technology it needed to catch up with the IBM System/370 - which the Japanese had seen as a great competitive leap. In 1974 it was further agreed that Amdahl computers would be produced by Fujitsu in Japan, for sale in the US. In effect, still without adequate finances, he lost control to Fujitsu.</p>

<p><a name="The_Japanese" id="The_Japanese"></a></p>
<h3>The Japanese</h3>
<p>In addition, in the mid 1970's under the prodding of its government agency MITI, the Japanese IT vendors announced that - all competition in shipbuilding, automobiles and consumer electronics having been destroyed - they were now setting their sights on computers. Japan appeared unbeatable, for it had overwhelmed and destroyed the native industries in all the previous markets it had attacked. It was particularly adept at taking existing technology and developing it (and in the process producing it to a higher quality standard and at a lower cost). This had caused panic amongst the computer industry as a whole, but had been received with relative equanimity by IBM. Japan's previous inability to develop effective software, coupled with the fact that IBM had, at that time, yet to see any large scale successes by the Japanese mainframe manufacturers, had left IBM's senior management largely unworried. Indeed, IBM was still the clear market leader in Japan itself and its S/370 launch had, in fact, destabilised most of the Japanese computer industry. However, the on-going MITI programme climaxed, in the late 1970s, following on its success with the VLSI memory chip programme (which eventually gave Japan a world-beating dominance in this field), with its announcement that it was funding a 'fifth generation' of computers.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Amdahl and Fujitsu">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Amdahl_and_Fujitsu" id="Amdahl_and_Fujitsu"></a></p>
<h3>Amdahl and Fujitsu</h3>
<p>This announcement, unfortunately, occurred at a time when, in 1979, Fujitsu had - with the assistance of the technology acquired from Amdahl - at last overtaken IBM as leader of the Japanese market and had started to make profits on its range of computer products. The shock waves of this combination of events finally hit IBM; causing panic in much the same way that it had for the rest of the industry half a decade earlier. Japan now appeared potentially unbeatable to IBM's management as well as to the rest of the IT world. In association with Amdahl, Fujitsu had slowly built on its access to technology which was demonstrably in advance of IBM, and, at the time of the announcement of the fifth generation project, was at long last demonstrably capable of delivering this.</p>
<p>The word, therefore, went out from Armonk in the late 1970's that Japan was its most feared competitor. The message was clear and unambiguous. The other competitors could be tolerated but no mercy should be shown to any Japanese entries. The countries set up organisations under the somewhat confusing initials SSSO. This was confusing because there already was an SSO organisation supporting third parties; but perhaps the confusion was not unwelcome, where its sole function was to provide the muscle for competitive situations where plug compatible (i.e. Japanese) vendors were involved. As always, with the IBM of that time, such activities were to be kept spotlessly ethical. The grapevine, though, much appreciated the story of one middle manager (jokingly) suggesting at a key meeting that all competitors and prospects should be given a free copy of the 'Camp on Blood Island'; but it knew, as was indeed the case, that the campaigns had to be irreproachable. Nevertheless it was a mark of IBM's seriousness, and thus of its fear, that such campaigns were mounted at all.</p>
<p><b>Overreaction</b></p>
<p>In the event I believe that IBM probably overreacted. Japan did not succeed. The fifth generation project, which eventually got under way in 1982, was a failure; and was finally buried in 1992. The computing market ultimately proved to be very different to those where its heavyweight tactics had previously been so successful. In particular it required software support that was still largely beyond the capabilities of a Japanese industry cut off behind a bamboo curtain of its own marvellous, but non western, calligraphy.</p>
<p>In some respects it did still show that IBM was anything but complacent. It still ran scared, or at least welcomed the challenge. The IBM vocabulary no longer contained the word problem. Instead there were challenges; and (in the cynical atmosphere of the grapevine) those problems that were seen as being impossible were re-labelled as 'insuperable challenges' (or even more cynically as 'insuperable opportunities'!). In the case of Japan, though, it was almost as if IBM was looking for a fight, for a challenge, simply to tone up its flabby muscles.</p>
<p>In any case the ultimate outcome should have been indicated by the terminology. 'Plug compatible' indicates that there has in the first place to be a model, a standard, set by a dominant force in the industry; thus the very concept presumed the continuing dominance of IBM. The danger came much later when (especially in the PC market-place) the term was dropped!</p>
<p>Thus, even though the Japanese challenge wasn't successful, its impact on IBM was massive; in terms of the changes it stimulated within IBM itself! In the short-term the 3030x was announced at a price that stunned competition; but was still matched by Amdahl. Thereafter IBM was to set out its new, and very different, objective of becoming the lowest cost producer; quite simply so that it could not be undercut by Japan. Changing its decades long stance, production costs were to replace marketing strengths as IBM's competitive advantage. Over the following half decade, therefore, the investments in new plants put those of the 360 in the shade. Something like $5 billion to $10 billion per annum (an annual figure equal to the total investment in the S/360) was invested in this way; following the principle that - by building very sophisticated (and monumentally expensive) plants - the 'barriers to entry' for others would be prohibitive.</p>
<p>Speaking to investment analysts in November 1985 John Akers said "...our investments in research, development and engineering, plant property and equipment $32 billion over the past five years, an amount we expect to exceed in the next five years". The fruits of this investment were bitter for, with the fast-moving technology, it was IBM's plants, rather than the less sophisticated (but more flexible) ones of its competitors, which soon became obsolete.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Lowest Cost Producer">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Lowest_Cost_Producer" id="Lowest_Cost_Producer"></a></p>
<h3>Lowest Cost Producer</h3>
<p>This was the real damage caused to IBM. Over the next decade or more this one mistake sapped the strength of IBM. The importance of this new commitment to be 'lowest cost producer', in terms of the later decline of IBM, cannot be overestimated.</p>
<p>Even IBM management eventually had to admit this was a mistake; when the policy was reversed in 1987. But by then it was too late. The strategic momentum even in production, where plants then took a number of years to commission, meant that the effects still remained with IBM for more than a decade after the original decision. In particular, the relative inflexibility that these new plants introduced put IBM in a very weak position when, over the decade, 'product life cycles' reduced to below three years, and then in some areas to below a year! IBM's massive investments were designed to serve its older life-cycles, typically of more than 5 years for products and much longer in terms of the technology in the plants which made them. The result was, even under the capable management of John Opel, IBM was unable to match the speed with new 'fashions' emerged; and in John Akers less capable hands this became something of a rout!</p>
<p>The biggest casualty was one of IBM's most cherished beliefs. 'Lowest Cost Producer' was in almost direct conflict with 'Customer Service'; and this conflict (fatally) weakened IBM's responses, especially in its later dealings with 'Third Parties'. Indeed, it is arguable that the strength of the IBM's beliefs was best demonstrated by the problems which arose when IBM abandoned them.</p>
<p><b>Buying-In</b></p>
<p>In particular, Opel introduced many of the ideas which in the academic world came under the grand title of the 'make or buy' decision in management theory, and under the even grander title of 'transaction cost analysis' in economic theory. IBM had always 'bought-in' the products and services which other organisations produced more effectively and efficiently - though its purchasing system still set very high (IBM) standards for them to meet. In the 1980s this was boosted by the use of contract and temporary staff wherever possible. In particular, though, the (apparently) very successful example of the PC Group in buying in 'products' (most notably the Intel processors and Microsoft's operating system) was extended to other areas - especially to software.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Third Parties">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Third_Parties" id="Third_Parties"></a></p>
<h3>Third Parties</h3>
<p>Most important of all was the infatuation with 'Third Parties' as the solution to one of IBM's remaining cost problems; that of the 'channels of distribution'. Although I had by then signally failed in my attempts to explain the principles of mass marketing to IBM's UK board, they had at least recognised that the number of customers it needed to contact was about to expand dramatically; and were even more aware of the cost of the IBM sales-force in this context. Their thinking then went along the lines of 'if this can be passed to small businesses, which are not crippled by IBM's pay scales and, in particular, its very high overheads, the cost problem can be resolved'; and IBM would become the lowest cost producer in this area too. This distracted IBM's attention from the potential problems in its existing sales operation; and especially from the problem of extending coverage of the IBM customer service umbrella to much wider groups of end-users. The future of IBM, with its confident prediction of $100 billion by 1990, was to be in the hands of these cheap and efficient third parties - who were expected to account for more than half of IBM's sales in 1990!</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: The Switch to Outright Sale">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="The_Switch_to_Outright_Sale" id="The_Switch_to_Outright_Sale"></a></p>
<h3>The Switch to Outright Sale</h3>
<p>Hiding many of the emerging problems were the other supposedly sound management practices which were introduced at the same time. Rental of machines, which was the previous basis of IBM's customer relationship, meant that the customer could easily return them and switch to a competitive offering.</p>
<p>Traditionally the answer had been that the sales-force held them in place by superb relationship marketing. John Opel, though, found a much simpler expedient; that of selling the machines outright. This was easily achieved - from 1982 on - by weighting the pricing structure in favour of this and having the ever faithful IBM sales-force reverse their previous practice; to remove the 'danger' of competitors replacing rental machines.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, in turn, this introduced a number of less obvious dangers. The first of these was that the 'selling campaign', which had previously been almost continuous since the sales personnel had to defend their exposed rental machines almost daily, was now reduced to a short burst of activity once every two or three years. The wise sales professionals still continued to maintain the relationships through these periods of 'non-activity'. The unwise - of whom there proved to be not a few - used the time for the more traditional sales activity of unproductively chasing new prospects. Indeed, in research conducted by Andersen Consulting in 1993, the most frequent and significant complaint made by IBM customers (37%) was that IBM had lost touch with the market-place; though this was closely followed by the 35% that said it had failed to keep up with its more nimble competitors. IBM's arrogance as also seen (by 11%) as a major cause of IBM's decline.</p>
<p>Although it might have seemed almost a change in 'accounting practices', this break with the hidden factor which had previously driven IBM's selling practices was to ultimately prove a central factor in IBM's later downfall. As Mills &amp; Friesen pointed out, "Put bluntly, customers in the past had bought solutions and reliability from IBM; then IBM moved them down to buying boxes. Soon many customers concluded that they could get cheaper boxes elsewhere." 'Solutions' was not to feature again in IBM's strategy until the end of the 1990s!</p>
<p>Tom Watson Jr., in his 1990 autobiography, was also critical of this change "In spite of Frank's [Cary] success, he made a few decisions that caused me to wish I was still running the show. In particular I was alarmed when he and his eventual successor John Opel rapidly phased out the rental system, shifting billions of dollars worth of business to outright sales. They did this partly to free up capital that would otherwise have been tied up in rental machines. But it bothered me because rentals had been crucial to IBM's success. Rental contracts wedded us to our customers, gave us a powerful incentive to keep service top-notch, and made IBM stable and essentially depression proof."</p>
<p><b>The Cost to Customer Service</b></p>
<p>More insidiously, but as might have been predicted from its undermining by the new 'objectives', IBM's philosophy of 'customer service' now began to be subject to cost constraints, and was even charged for. The systems engineers, who had in practice been IBM's most powerful sales personnel, were withdrawn and 'sold' as a service; so that, in the 1990s, branches no longer had any staff undertaking this key role. The net result was that customer service deteriorated, even when IBM was providing it face to face. Of course, it became little more than a joke when 'IBM' dealer personnel were involved. Senior management began to talk of selling commodities (especially in terms of the PC), where the only deciding factor was to be the price. This was something that IBM had never considered in its three quarters of a century of history. It had always sold customer service, so that price alone was never a deciding factor. Even when price could not be avoided it had talked about 'price performance' (where the IBM service was a key element of the 'performance'). By the late 1980s, however, it was mostly talking just about price!</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Selling the Family Silver">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Selling_the_Family_Silver" id="Selling_the_Family_Silver"></a></p>
<h3>Selling the Family Silver</h3>
<p>A less obvious effect of the outright sales policy, and one which - amazingly - IBM management did not see, was that IBM's revenue (and especially its profits) were artificially inflated in the short term. It was inevitably a one-time source of income which would be exhausted in two or three years, but IBM's management seemingly overlooked this key fact! At around the same time, IBM had changed its very conservative accounting practices, to adopt more conventional ones. In particular, investment in R &amp; D was no longer paid as part of current costs, but was depreciated over future years. More controversially, the long-term 'capital value' of the leases (which IBM was now selling to replace the previous rental it had offered), were shown as income in the year in which the sale was made. Again, this inflated current income at the expense of the future.</p>
<p>These inflated figures set up unrealistic expectations of the future for the outside world; especially for IBM's stockholders, but also for all its other stakeholders. In particular, it gave IBM staff the warm feeling that they were invincible. I too was part of this happy band while I was inside IBM. When I worked out the figures later, and realized what was happening, I was genuinely shocked. Even then I couldn't believe the obvious and, after much soul-searching, played down the feature with the comment, "This rosy picture may have fooled outside observers, but Armonk, as astute as ever, uses future projections which discount this short-term effect".</p>
<p>This rosy picture was believed by IBM's management. It seems incredible now, but nobody in senior management was willing to recognize what was happening; a classic case of 'groupthink' - since I cannot imagine that all of IBM's accountants failed to notice it. The figures which IBM senior management worked to showed annual growth rates of 20 - 30%; and IBM's sales-force was accordingly targeted with these growth rates year upon year. Unfortunately, the underlying figure (excluding the one-off, outright-sales, boom), was actually below 10%. Though this was still a good performance, not dramatically different to IBM's historical record over previous years, it did not unfortunately justify the 100,000 extra staff who were then being hired!</p>
<p>This myopia had two dramatic consequences. The first was that it distorted the strategy which IBM management was setting. IBM's board really did believe that the growth was totally sustainable; and actually would lead to their dream of IBM becoming the first $100 billion per annum corporation. At the time this was central to IBM's strategy, and coloured everything it did. Not least it justified recruiting the extra 100,000 staff which it would, a decade later, have to lay off again (in the process abandoning IBM's core belief in lifetime employment). The second important consequence was that the IBM incorporated the figures as a basic premise for its success. Anything less than 20%, let alone an unthinkably low 10%, growth per annum was seen to be an unacceptable failure. The reality was that, after the one-off effect ran out, IBM's growth rate fell to normal. Indeed, as one might expect of such processes involving mortgaging the future, it actually fell to zero - and even showed a slight decline. This was not seen as 'business as usual', as it might have been in any other organization, but was deemed to be a dismal failure; by the markets and especially by the frantic IBM senior management. The fact that this 'failure' (even when the figures returned to 10% growth in 1987) still represented a dramatic success in terms of other organisation's results was ignored, and the culture suffered its first (massive) loss of confidence - and began its long slide into oblivion!</p>
<p>Thus it was that John Opel fatally undermined the three core competences of IBM; enshrined in its three beliefs:</p>
<p><b>Respect for the Individual</b> - although he would not have admitted it, probably not even to himself, John Opel's reign started the downward slide in its relations with its employees. Although they still remained in theory, many of the cherished personnel policies were discretely circumnavigated in practice. Since the time of Thomas J Watson the 'relationship with its employees' had always been its greatest strength. In the years running up to the 1980s this had, in particular, been reflected in the great flexibility, and indeed desire for change, which had enabled IBM to survive in such a turbulent industry. That flexibility was to be needed even more over the next decade, and yet IBM was having to rely upon an increasingly demoralised and alienated workforce.</p>
<p><b>Customer Service</b> - again without any clear intent - but following the policy of 'lowest cost producer' - IBM's management had been seduced away from providing the highest levels of service to its customers. Worst of all, its most visible customer service, that provided to its millions of PC customers, had been sub-contracted to dealers most of whom were - correctly - seen by their (and hence IBM's) customers to be little more than charlatans.</p>
<p><b>Pursuit of Excellence</b> - this was a more insidious process. The PC Independent Business Unit - then minuscule in IBM terms - had no choice, if it was to meet its very tight deadlines, but to source its hardware and software outside of IBM. This in effect gave Intel and Microsoft, in particular, their 'patents' on IBM's most visible developments. That the original managers in PC group negotiated such damaging agreements (especially with Microsoft which actually bought the operating system, 'on behalf of IBM', for only $75,000 and then made literally billions of dollars from it) is perhaps understandable. What is incredible is that over the following years (and indeed nearly a decade) no one in IBM developed a successful policy to counter the threat.</p>
<p>Many commentators would argue that IBM's problems were a result of the changes in the market - which the successful IBM of old was not able to handle (though it had by then been handling such changes, often against far greater odds, for the best part of three quarters of a century). The irony is that in reality it was IBM itself, very clearly led by John Opel, which had initiated (and then strongly promoted) these changes.</p>
<p><b>The Ratings Slip</b></p>
<p>The scale of the problem was made obvious when the business magazine Fortune released its 1987 poll (of 6,000 business executives) as to which was the top rated US corporation. Since the poll began IBM had been rated top overall every year. In 1987, as IBM's image began to be equated (by its own wish!) with that of its dealers, its position slumped to seventh. Worse still in 1988 it plummeted to thirty-second - and by the beginning of the 1990s it was placed below 200 out of 300 runners. How were the mighty fallen! It took a decade, until 1998, for IBM to return to a number one spot in Fortune's Most Admired Companies - and even then only in the 'computer, office equipment' category.</p>
<p>Even so, the IBM's results in 1988 began to recover (after three bad years), and Akers seems to have relaxed. He returned to the tactic of urging IBM'ers to cut bureaucracy. Such tactics might have worked for Tom Watson Jr. But Akers did not have the same leverage, and certainly did not have the time, though he never quite seemed to realise this.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Risc and Risk">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Risc_and_Risk" id="Risc_and_Risk"></a></p>
<h3>Risc and Risk</h3>
<p>Sometime around the mid 1980s one of IBM's major developments in the laboratories was a range of RISC based minis, which eventually emerged, in one form, as the very successful RS/6000 workstations. There was, however, another project which was just as important - and was linked to this. This was the extension of an IBM version of UNIX to all its low end mainframes (the ones in the mid-range 4300 series of mainframes just as much as the AS400 and the, later, RS/6000; as well as the PC). This had reached an advanced stage of planning and indeed was only a few months away from launch. For example, detailed plans were in place to retrain the whole sales-force in UNIX - a major investment, of many weeks of training, for each of them. It was intended that this would answer the problem of incompatibility, since the reason for this was to be largely found in the software not the hardware. Using the new RISC-based processors, UNIX would have allowed most of the IBM range to talk to each other as did the DEC range. The only exception would have been largest processors; and they would have had interfaces added to their software to overcome even that problem. Converging five IBM systems into one, it would have added a great degree of 'open systems' capability, allowing in other (hardware and especially, IBM hoped, software companies to 'add value'), in much the same way that the PC had achieved the same results. In retrospect, it is possible to now see that it could have put IBM in a commanding position in terms of the actual market developments which, by then beyond its control, came about in the 1990s!</p>
<p>In practice, this major development never saw the light of day. It may be that there was an insuperable technical problem (and the abandonment of the related 'Fort Knox' hardware may, indeed, have had this effect), but that would have been unlikely to have held it back indefinitely. Some believe that this was the result of the clashes between the various laboratories involved. Perhaps more likely was that that IBM management had begun to realise the risks which 'open systems' brought with them! On the other hand, the open systems philosophy was by then unstoppable; and the abandonment only meant that IBM lost out twice - it finally had to accept the inevitable in the 1990s, but by then it was one of the laggards! It was another of the early changes of direction which later seemed almost to paralyse <a href="/wiki/John_Akers.html" title="John Akers">John Akers</a> and his management team, for there was no obvious replacement - other than mundane enhancements to the power of the computers - and this was something at which the competition were much better than IBM!</p>
<p><b>Fort Knox Tumbles</b></p>
<p>'Fort Knox' had (according to Paul Carroll) absorbed the effort of 4,000 developers over four years. This was intended to use RISC based architecture across the whole of the lower end of IBM's mainframe and mini range - to allow these, in combination with UNIX based software, to talk to each other (and to combat DEC's increasing strength with its VAX range). At the time this was one of IBM's most important, and best kept, secrets. Paul Carroll claims that it was, once more, one of IBM's failures in development. However, despite the assertions of Frank Soltis, there was no good 'technical' reason to abandon it. Perhaps it was again the 'Open Systems' approach (of the UNIX software more than the hardware) which caused IBM to rethink the project; and to start down its path of fatal indecision.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Price Cutting">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Price_Cutting" id="Price_Cutting"></a></p>
<h3>Price Cutting</h3>
<p>The inertia of the consumer service factors (perhaps most cynically summed up in the phrase 'Nobody ever got fired for buying IBM') carried IBM forward through its 'successes' of the first half of the 1980s and the real problems didn't emerge until mid-decade. These problems came about because IBM management was starting to think in commodity pricing terms. On the other hand, it had long been almost a religious dogma at IBM that it did not cut prices, no matter how big the customer was.</p>
<p>The problem first surfaced when this dogma could no longer be sustained, as PC dealers took over as its point of contact with IBM's largest customers, rather than the small businesses the IBM strategy had called for them to support! Even then, there was no problem for the first two years as customers queued to buy the rationed PCs. The problem emerged when supply eventually exceeded demand. Most of the dealers had no answer other than to cut price. They had almost no technical expertise, and as little marketing talent, so their only answer was to be cheaper than everyone else. The result was predictable. Their discounts were ratcheted up - dealer vying with dealer to buy business at the lowest price. Eventually it soaked up almost all of the 35% discount or so that the larger dealers received; and sometimes went beyond, as dealers - whose mass marketing knowledge was even worse than IBM's - foolishly 'invested' in the future, with the lowest prices! In the process, IBM found that its prices (for the PC was still seen as being IBM's no matter who sold it) were widely, and very publicly, discounted. Indeed, they were massively discounted - far more deeply than even its most aggressive mainframe competitors had offered in the past! To counter the prices offered in this way, even its own mainframe sales-forces had to start discounting the PC.</p>
<p><b>Dealer Prices</b></p>
<p>The problem for IBM was not just that it could not fix its dealers' prices, that would have been illegal, but that it no longer had any justification for a price premium. The product being offered by its competitors was almost exactly the same - it was, after all, 'IBM compatible'. Worse still, the key justification which IBM had offered in terms of 'price performance', its fabled customer service, no longer applied. By common agreement PC dealer salesmen ranked somewhere below used-car dealers. In any case, what little service there was could be obtained, from exactly the same dealers, by IBM's compatible competitors!. So, even beyond what was offered in the way of discounts, IBM eventually had to lower its published prices; in an escalating race which saw published prices for comparable packages fall, just two years later in 1985, to around a quarter of the launch levels.</p>
<p><b>Mainframe Prices</b></p>
<p>IBM found it easy to dissociate itself from what it saw to be very special price-cutting on the PC, but its customers did not! The typical scenario which started to emerge in the mid 1980s saw the IBM account manager about to close a multi-million dollar sale on a mainframe being asked the usual question about discounts, and giving the usual answer; 'IBM never gives discounts'. The difference this time was that the customer no longer was willing to accept this, but pointed out that only a few weeks previously the same account manager had negotiated a 35% discount on a much lower value of PC business! Under these circumstances, the account manager was glad to get away with a 10% discount on the mainframe sale, and the branch were happy to give it - they desperately needed the business. Later, in one of the decentralisation moves which did work, the sales-force were able to give discounts without reference to senior management; and needless to say they did! It is difficult to believe that some of the larger discounts which then appeared, reportedly reaching as high as 50% on key business - coming very close to covering only IBM's variable costs - did not require the approval of senior management . That alone should have set off very loud alarm bells.</p>

<h3>Voluntary Redundancies</h3>
<p>The almost inevitable corollary of price cutting is cost cutting. IBM had always been efficient, apart perhaps from the intractable problem of administration overheads, and John Opel's 'lowest cost producer' drive had increasingly focused attention on this aspect of IBM's business. John Akers, making the mistake of so many other executives when faced with problems, went much further. Abandoning the salesman's charm which had been his main forte previously, he became a ruthless management activist. In 1986 he was forced to announce the first of the packages to slim back IBM from the level of 400,000 employees which had resulted from John Opel's earlier - misguided - attempts to reach $100 billion turnover by 1990. By that time it had at last become obvious even to Armonk that this target was unreachable. The package (euphemistically called FAP - Financial Assistance Package), which included attractive early-retirement and severance offers, took 10,000 jobs out of the US workforce - as IBM went into reverse. In the following year, 1987, according to Bob Heller 15,000 employees left IBM - semi-voluntarily - while another 21,000 were re-deployed; 11,000 of them added to the sales force - though the evidence was that, despite their very expensive retraining, most of these also left the company over the next few years.</p>
<p>By 1991 John Akers was looking to cut staff to around 300,000, from the peak of 407,000 - which had resulted from the misguided expansion of the early 1980s. This reduction was supposedly to be achieved without layoffs; thus maintaining the fiction of 'lifetime employment'. But, instead, pressure - sometimes amounting to unbearable stress - was being put on staff throughout the organization. They were, in effect, being forced to take one of the number of 'attractive' packages which were available to those who chose to leave. In theory, though, IBM's lifetime employment was still intact, even John Akers could not yet face that break. In a 'question and answer' section of the 1991 Annual Report, he said "We believe full employment reinforces pride and morale…", though he did add later in the report "…If further significant reductions are required, we will reassess full employment…". In reality - as all the staff knew - the philosophy was by now only a theoretical concept; the practice, of which they became increasingly afraid, was widespread redundancies!</p>

<p><a name="The_Cost_of_Cost_Cutting" id="The_Cost_of_Cost_Cutting"></a></p>
<h3>The Cost of Cost Cutting</h3>
<p>Cost-cutting became the major theme for IBM and, when the 1989 results crashed, the financial effects of this - together with a 'cushion' of extra funds for 1990 - were hidden amongst the restructuring costs; as another 10,000 jobs went. The process was discretely labeled - in some parts of IBM at least - as its 'Career Transition Programme' (the transition in question being that out of IBM!), but known irreverently - but accurately - to employees as 'cash to piss-off'. From 1986 to 1991, IBM cut its headcount by 21,000, closing 19 US plants; though, once more, nobody was actually fired - it resulted from normal attrition and the very attractive early-retirement plans.</p>
<p>It has been claimed that "…the policy of not firing people accounted for 80% of the debt IBM accumulated in the early 1990s." It is argued that, rather than maintaining morale, this resulted in nothing less than raw fear; and staff kept their heads down awaiting the redundancies to come!</p>

<p><a name="Losses" id="Losses"></a></p>
<h3>Losses</h3>
<p>When the major losses started, in 1991 (with a $47 million loss - the first in three quarters of a century - but admittedly after major restructuring charges), the cost-saving effort was redoubled. IBM until then had traditionally embraced a five point scale of individual performance, of which only the bottom '5' position (to which very few sank) was deemed 'unsatisfactory'. Akers then changed it to a four point scale. More important, he insisted on a bell shaped distribution - 10% of employees would be '1's, 40% would be '2's and another 40% '3's, and - crucially - 10% would be '4's (and hence deemed unsatisfactory). The fours would be further divided by making half of them 'Four-Check'; with the statement that if they did not improve rapidly they would be offered a severance package or simply fired. There might have been a great deal of sense in improving a system which clearly had its flaws, but - in the context of IBM's philosophies (especially that which incorporated 'lifetime employment' ) - it was almost the final blow.</p>

<p>IBM has often been described as having a sales-centric or a sales-oriented business culture. Indeed, it is agrguable that its most important control device is the <a  class="new" title="IBM Sales Plan">IBM Sales Plan</a>. Traditionally, many of its executives and general managers would be chosen from its sales force. In addition, middle and top management would often be enlisted to give direct support to salesmen in the process of making sales to important customers.</p>
<p>For most of the 20th century, a blue suit, white shirt, and a dark tie was the public uniform of IBM employees. But by the 1990s, IBM relaxed these codes; the dress and behavior of its employees does not differ appreciably from that of their counterparts in large technology companies.</p>
<p>In 2003, IBM embarked on an ambitious project to rewrite company values using its <i>Jam</i> technology -- Intranet-based online discussions on key business issues for a limited time, involving more than 50,000 employees over 3 days in this case. Jam technology includes sophisticated text analysis software (eClassifier) to mine online comments for themes, and Jams have now been used six times internally at IBM. As a result of the 2003 Jam, the company values were updated to reflect three modern business, marketplace and employee views: "Dedication to every client's success", "Innovation that matters - for our company and for the world", "Trust and personal responsibility in all relationships."<sup id="_ref-24" class="reference"><a  title="">[31]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 2004, another Jam was conducted in which more than 52,000 employees exchanged best practices for 72 hours. This event was focused on finding actionable ideas to support implementation of the values identified previously. A new post-Jam Ratings event was developed to allow IBMers to select key ideas that support the values. (For further information, see Harvard Business Review, December, 2004, interview with IBM Chairman Sam Palmisano.)</p>

IBM was the only technology company ranked in <i><a href="/wiki/Working_Mother.html" title="Working Mother">Working Mother</a></i> magazine's Top 10 for 2004, and one of two technology companies in 2005 (the other company being Hewlett-Packard).<sup id="_ref-28" class="reference"><a  title="">[35]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-29" class="reference"><a  title="">[36]</a></sup></p>
<p>The company has traditionally resisted <a href="/wiki/Trade_union.html" title="Trade union">labor union</a> organizing, although unions represent some IBM workers outside the United States. <a  class="external text" title="http://www.allianceibm.org">Alliance@IBM</a>, part of the <a href="/wiki/Communications_Workers_of_America.html" title="Communications Workers of America">Communications Workers of America</a>, is trying to organize IBM in the U.S. with very little success.</p>
<p>In the 1990s, two major <a href="/wiki/Pension.html" title="Pension">pension</a> program changes, including a conversion to a cash balance plan, resulted in an employee <a href="/wiki/Class_action.html" title="Class action">class action</a> lawsuit alleging <a href="/wiki/Age_discrimination.html" title="Age discrimination">age discrimination</a>. IBM employees won the lawsuit and arrived at a partial settlement, although appeals are still underway.</p>
<p>Historically IBM has had a good reputation of long-term staff retention with few large scale layoffs. In more recent years there have been a number of broad sweeping cuts to the workforce as IBM attempts to adapt to changing market conditions and a declining profit base. After posting weaker than expected revenues in the first quarter of 2005, IBM eliminated 14,500 positions from its workforce, predominantly in Europe. On <a href="/wiki/June_8.html" title="June 8">June 8</a>, <a href="/wiki/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>, IBM Canada Ltd. eliminated approximately 700 positions. IBM projects these as part of a strategy to 'rebalance' its portfolio of professional skills &amp; businesses. <a href="/wiki/IBM_India.html" title="IBM India">IBM India</a> and other IBM offices in <a href="/wiki/China.html" title="China">China</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Philippines.html" title="Philippines">Philippines</a> and <a href="/wiki/Costa_Rica.html" title="Costa Rica">Costa Rica</a> have been witnessing a recruitment boom and steady growth in number of employees.</p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/October_10.html" title="October 10">October 10</a>, <a href="/wiki/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>, IBM became the first major company in the world to formally commit to not using <a href="/wiki/Genetic_testing.html" title="Genetic testing">genetic information</a> in its employment decisions. This came just a few months after IBM announced its support of the <a href="/wiki/National_Geographic_Society.html" title="National Geographic Society">National Geographic Society</a>'s <a href="/wiki/The_Genographic_Project.html" title="The Genographic Project">Genographic Project</a>.</p>
