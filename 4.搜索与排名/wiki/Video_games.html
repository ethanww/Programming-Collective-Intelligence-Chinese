<p>A <b>computer game</b> is a <a href="/wiki/Computer.html" title="Computer">computer</a>-controlled game. A <b>video game</b> is a computer game where a video display such as a <a href="/wiki/Computer_display.html" title="Computer display">monitor</a> or <a href="/wiki/Television.html" title="Television">television</a> is the primary feedback device. The term "computer game" also includes games which display only text (and which can therefore theoretically be played on a <a href="/wiki/Teletypewriter.html" title="Teletypewriter">teletypewriter</a>) or which use other methods, such as sound or vibration, as their primary feedback device, but there are very few new games in these categories. There always must also be some sort of <a href="/wiki/Input_device.html" title="Input device">input device</a>, usually in the form of <a href="/wiki/Button_%28control%29.html" title="Button (control)">button/joystick</a> combinations (on arcade games), a <a href="/wiki/Computer_keyboard.html" title="Computer keyboard">keyboard</a> &amp; <a href="/wiki/Computer_mouse.html" title="Computer mouse">mouse</a>/<a href="/wiki/Trackball.html" title="Trackball">trackball</a> combination (computer games), or a <a href="/wiki/Game_controller.html" title="Game controller">controller</a> (<a href="/wiki/Video_game_console.html" title="Video game console">console</a> games), or a combination of any of the above. Also, more esoteric devices have been used for input (<i>see also</i> <a href="/wiki/Game_controller.html" title="Game controller">Game controller</a>). Usually there are rules and goals, but in more open-ended games the player may be free to do whatever they like within the confines of the virtual universe.</p>
<p>The phrase <b>interactive entertainment</b> is the formal reference to computer and video games. To avoid ambiguity, this game software is referred to as "<i>computer and video games</i>" throughout this article, which explores properties common to both types of game</p>
<p>In common usage, a "computer game" or a "<a href="/wiki/Personal_computer_game.html" title="Personal computer game">PC game</a>" refers to a game that is played on a <a href="/wiki/Personal_computer.html" title="Personal computer">personal computer</a>. "<a href="/wiki/Console_game.html" title="Console game">Console game</a>" refers to one that is played on a device specifically designed for the use of such, while interfacing with a standard <a href="/wiki/Television.html" title="Television">television</a> set. "Video game" (or "videogame"), in places where the term is used, has evolved into a catchall phrase that encompasses the aforementioned along with any game made for any other device, including, but not limited to, <a href="/wiki/Mobile_phone.html" title="Mobile phone">mobile phones</a>, <a href="/wiki/Personal_digital_assistant.html" title="Personal digital assistant">PDAs</a>, advanced <a href="/wiki/Calculator.html" title="Calculator">calculators</a>, etc.</p>

<h3>Beginnings</h3>
<p>The first primitive computer and video games were developed in the 1950s and 60's and ran on platforms such as <a href="/wiki/Oscilloscope.html" title="Oscilloscope">oscilloscopes</a>, university <a href="/wiki/Mainframe.html" title="Mainframe">mainframes</a> and <a href="/wiki/EDSAC.html" title="EDSAC">EDSAC</a> computers. The earliest computer game, a <a href="/wiki/Missile.html" title="Missile">missile</a> simulation, was created in 1947 by Thomas T. Goldsmith Jr. and Estle Ray Mann. A patent application was filed on January 25th, 1947 and U.S. Patent #2,455,992 issued on Dec 14th, 1948. Later in 1952, was a version of tic-tac-toe named <i><a href="/wiki/Noughts_and_Crosses.html" title="Noughts and Crosses">Noughts and Crosses</a></i>, created by <a  class="new" title="A. S. Douglas">A. S. Douglas</a>, as part of his doctoral dissertation at <a href="/wiki/Cambridge_University.html" title="Cambridge University">Cambridge University</a>. The game ran on a large university computer called the Electronic Delay Storage Automatic Calculator (EDSAC). In 1958, <a href="/wiki/William_Higinbotham.html" title="William Higinbotham">William Higinbotham</a> - who previously helped build the first <a href="/wiki/Atomic_bomb.html" title="Atomic bomb">atomic bomb</a> - created <i><a href="/wiki/Tennis_for_Two.html" title="Tennis for Two">Tennis for Two</a></i> at the <a href="/wiki/Brookhaven_National_Laboratory.html" title="Brookhaven National Laboratory">Brookhaven National Laboratory</a> in Upton, New York to entertain visitors at the lab's annual open house. In 1962 <a href="/wiki/MIT.html" title="MIT">MIT</a>'s <a href="/wiki/Steve_Russell.html" title="Steve Russell">Steve Russell</a> created <i><a href="/wiki/Spacewar%21.html" title="Spacewar!">Spacewar!</a></i> and <i><a  class="new" title="John's Great Adventure">John's Great Adventure</a></i>. The game ran on a PDP-1 mini-computer. The game spread quickly to universities and research facilities around the country. In 1968 <a href="/wiki/Ralph_Baer.html" title="Ralph Baer">Ralph Baer</a>, who would later be known as the "Father of Video Games", applied for a patent for an early version of a video game console named the "Television Gaming and Training Apparatus." In 1967, Baer created a ping-pong like game for the console that resembled <i>Tennis for Two</i> (and the future 1972 arcade game <i><a href="/wiki/Pong.html" title="Pong">Pong</a></i>). He worked with <a href="/wiki/Magnavox.html" title="Magnavox">Magnavox</a> to create and release the first console, named the <a href="/wiki/Magnavox_Odyssey.html" title="Magnavox Odyssey">Magnavox Odyssey</a>, in 1972.</p>

</div>
<p><a href="/wiki/Arcade_games.html" title="Arcade games">Arcade games</a> were developed in the 1970s and led to the so-called "<a href="/wiki/Golden_Age_of_Arcade_Games.html" title="Golden Age of Arcade Games">Golden Age of Arcade Games</a>". The first coin-operated arcade game was <i><a href="/wiki/Computer_Space.html" title="Computer Space">Computer Space</a></i>, created in 1971 by <a href="/wiki/Nolan_Bushnell.html" title="Nolan Bushnell">Nolan Bushnell</a>. In these pre-arcade days, the game was placed in bars and taverns. The game required players to read a set of instructions before playing, and never became a hit in the bar scene. In the spring of 1972, Bushnell attended a demonstration of the Magnavox Odyssey system in <a href="/wiki/Burlingame%2C_California.html" title="Burlingame, California">Burlingame, California</a>, and played Baer's ping-pong game for the first time. Soon afterwards Bushnell and a friend formed a new company, <a href="/wiki/Atari.html" title="Atari">Atari</a> (the friend was the same one who came up with the idea for the <a href="/wiki/Chuck_E._Cheese.html" title="Chuck E. Cheese">Chuck E. Cheese</a> restaurants). Nolan envisioned creating a driving game for arcades. He hired an electronic engineer named <a href="/wiki/Al_Alcorn.html" title="Al Alcorn">Al Alcorn</a> and directed him to build a <a href="/wiki/Ping-pong.html" title="Ping-pong">ping-pong</a> game. The game Alcorn created was so much fun that Nolan decided to go ahead and market it. Since the name <i>Ping-Pong</i> was already <a href="/wiki/Trademark.html" title="Trademark">trademarked</a>, they settled on simply calling it <i><a href="/wiki/PONG.html" title="PONG">PONG</a></i>. The intuitive interface led the game to be wildly successful in the bar scene and ushered in the era of arcades.</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: Consoles and beyond">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="Consoles_and_beyond" id="Consoles_and_beyond"></a></p>
<h3>Consoles and beyond</h3>
<p>The 1970s saw the release of the first home <a href="/wiki/Video_game_console.html" title="Video game console">video game consoles</a>. The patent for Ralph Baer's <a href="/wiki/Magnavox_Odyssey.html" title="Magnavox Odyssey">Magnavox Odyssey</a> was granted in 1972, and paved the way for the next wave of home consoles. The late 1970s to early 1980s brought about the improvement of home consoles and the release of the <a href="/wiki/Atari_2600.html" title="Atari 2600">Atari 2600</a>, <a href="/wiki/Intellivision.html" title="Intellivision">Intellivision</a> and <a href="/wiki/Colecovision.html" title="Colecovision">Colecovision</a>. They enjoyed a successful number of years on the market, especially the Atari 2600. However that soon came to an end.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Video_game_crash_of_1983.html" title="Video game crash of 1983">video game crash of 1983</a>, which was brought forth due to the oversaturation of the video game market by 3rd party support of these systems, specifically the Atari systems, produced a <i>dark age</i> in the market. Another factor that led to the demise of the home gaming market was the fact that many of these games that were being produced were just ill produced games with no play value whatsoever, all in order to take advantage of the game craze.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Nintendo.html" title="Nintendo">Nintendo's</a> <a href="/wiki/Nintendo_Entertainment_System.html" title="Nintendo Entertainment System">Nintendo Entertainment System</a> (NES) reached North America in 1985 and single-handedly brought back the home gaming market. <a href="/wiki/Sega.html" title="Sega">Sega</a> released its <a href="/wiki/Sega_Master_System.html" title="Sega Master System">Master System</a>, but it never reached the level of popularity as the NES did, at least not in America. Nintendo went on to create some of America's best-known characters, with games such as <i><a href="/wiki/Mario_Bros..html" title="Mario Bros.">Mario Bros.</a></i> and other Nintendo franchises, many of which are still popular today. One of the main factors that Nintendo regulated, to prevent another crash, was the limiting of 3rd party supporters for the NES by limiting the number of games they could produce for their system, which was 5 a year. Subsequently gaming houses such as Konami and others created subsidiary companies to go around the regulations. Nintendo also created its Seal of Approval to games to help gamers make decisions on games that met the standards of Nintendo.</p>
<p>The last two decades of game history have been marked by separate markets for games on <a href="/wiki/Video_game_consoles.html" title="Video game consoles">video game consoles</a>, <a href="/wiki/Home_computers.html" title="Home computers">home computers</a> and <a href="/wiki/Handhelds.html" title="Handhelds">handhelds</a>. See the article on <a href="/wiki/Console_wars.html" title="Console wars">Console wars</a> for additional information on that facet of game history.</p>
<p>In 1989, Nintendo released the <a href="/wiki/Game_Boy.html" title="Game Boy">Game Boy</a>, the first popular <a href="/wiki/Handheld_game_console.html" title="Handheld game console">handheld console</a>. Included with the system was <a href="/wiki/Tetris.html" title="Tetris">Tetris</a>, which became a popular puzzle game. Several rival handhelds also made their debut around that time, including the <a href="/wiki/Sega_Game_Gear.html" title="Sega Game Gear">Sega Game Gear</a> and <a href="/wiki/Atari_Lynx.html" title="Atari Lynx">Atari Lynx</a>. While some of the other systems remained in production until the mid-90s, the Game Boy remained at the top spot in sales throughout its lifespan.</p>
<p>The North American market was dominated by the <a href="/wiki/Sega.html" title="Sega">Sega</a> <a href="/wiki/Sega_Mega_Drive/Sega_Genesis.html" title="Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis">Genesis</a> early on after its debut in 1989, with the <a href="/wiki/SNES.html" title="SNES">Super Nintendo Entertainment System</a> proving a strong, roughly equal rival in 1991. The <a href="/wiki/NEC_Corporation.html" title="NEC Corporation">NEC</a> <a href="/wiki/TurboGrafx_16.html" title="TurboGrafx 16">TurboGrafx 16</a> was the first 16-bit system to be marketed in the region, but did not achieve a large following, partly due to a limited library of English games and effective marketing from Sega. In Japan, the <a href="/wiki/PC_Engine.html" title="PC Engine">PC Engine</a>'s (Turbografx 16) 1987 success against the <a href="/wiki/Famicom.html" title="Famicom">Famicom</a> (NES) and <a href="/wiki/CD.html" title="CD">CD</a> drive peripheral allowed it to fend off the <a href="/wiki/Sega_Mega_Drive/Sega_Genesis.html" title="Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis">Mega Drive</a> (Genesis) in 1988, which never really caught on to the same degree as outside Japan. The PC Engine eventually lost out to the <a href="/wiki/Super_Famicom.html" title="Super Famicom">Super Famicom</a>, but retained enough of a user base to support new games well into the late 1990s. CD-ROM drives were first seen in this generation, as add-ons for the PC Engine in 1988 and the Megadrive in 1991. Basic <a href="/wiki/3D_graphics.html" title="3D graphics">3D graphics</a> entered the mainstream with flat-shaded polygons enabled by additional processors in game cartridges like <a href="/wiki/Virtua_Racing.html" title="Virtua Racing">Virtua Racing</a> and <a href="/wiki/Star_Fox.html" title="Star Fox">Star Fox</a>.</p>

<p>In 1994-1995, Sega released <a href="/wiki/Sega_Saturn.html" title="Sega Saturn">Sega Saturn</a> and <a href="/wiki/Sony.html" title="Sony">Sony</a> made its debut to the video gaming scene with the <a href="/wiki/PlayStation.html" title="PlayStation">PlayStation</a>. Both consoles used <a href="/wiki/32-bit.html" title="32-bit">32-bit</a> technology; the door was open for 3D games. After many delays, Nintendo released its <a href="/wiki/64-bit.html" title="64-bit">64-bit</a> console, the <a href="/wiki/Nintendo_64.html" title="Nintendo 64">Nintendo 64</a> in 1996, selling more than 1.5 million units in only three months. The flagship title, <i><a href="/wiki/Super_Mario_64.html" title="Super Mario 64">Super Mario 64</a></i>, became a defining title for 3D platform games. Nintendo's choice to use <a href="/wiki/Cartridge_%28electronics%29.html" title="Cartridge (electronics)">cartridges</a> instead of <a href="/wiki/CD-ROM.html" title="CD-ROM">CD-ROMs</a> for the Nintendo 64, unique among the consoles of this period, proved to have negative consequences. In particular, <a href="/wiki/Square_Co.%2C_Ltd..html" title="Square Co., Ltd.">SquareSoft</a>, which had released all previous games in its <i><a href="/wiki/Final_Fantasy.html" title="Final Fantasy">Final Fantasy</a></i> series for Nintendo consoles, now turned to the PlayStation; <i><a href="/wiki/Final_Fantasy_VII.html" title="Final Fantasy VII">Final Fantasy VII</a></i> (1997) was a huge success, establishing the popularity of role-playing games in the west and making the PlayStation the primary console for the genre. One of the biggest successes for the Nintendo 64 was Goldeneye, based on the <a href="/wiki/James_Bond.html" title="James Bond">James Bond</a> film, which included many references to other films. By the end of this period, Sony had dethroned Nintendo, the PlayStation outselling the Nintendo 64. The Saturn was moderately successful in Japan but a failure in North America, leaving Sega outside of the main competition.</p>
<p>1998 saw the releases of the Sega <a href="/wiki/Dreamcast.html" title="Dreamcast">Dreamcast</a> in Japan (1999 in the US) and the <a href="/wiki/Game_Boy_Color.html" title="Game Boy Color">Game Boy Color</a> from Nintendo. In 2000 Sony released the widely anticipated <a href="/wiki/PlayStation_2.html" title="PlayStation 2">PlayStation 2</a>. In 2001 <a href="/wiki/Microsoft.html" title="Microsoft">Microsoft</a> entered the videogame console industry by releasing its new home console, the <a href="/wiki/Xbox.html" title="Xbox">Xbox</a>. Its flagship game, <i><a  title="Halo: Combat Evolved">Halo: Combat Evolved</a></i>, was available at the system's launch. Nintendo released their successor to the Nintendo 64, the <a href="/wiki/GameCube.html" title="GameCube">GameCube</a>, and the first all-new Game Boy since the console's inception, the <a href="/wiki/Game_Boy_Advance.html" title="Game Boy Advance">Game Boy Advance</a>. Sega realized they could no longer compete especially with Sony's new PS2, and announced they would discontinue the Dreamcast and no longer manufacture hardware, becoming a <a href="/wiki/Third-party_developer.html" title="Third-party developer">third-party developer</a> in 2002.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Nokia.html" title="Nokia">Nokia</a> entered the handheld market with its N-Gage game-phone <a href="/wiki/Hybrid.html" title="Hybrid">hybrid</a> in 2003. It was criticised for being poorly designed, and flopped. In 2004 Nokia released a re-designed N-Gage, called the <a href="/wiki/N-Gage_QD.html" title="N-Gage QD">N-Gage QD</a>, which didn't fare much better. The other two more technically advanced handhelds to be released in 2004, the <a href="/wiki/Nintendo_DS.html" title="Nintendo DS">Nintendo DS</a> and the <a href="/wiki/PlayStation_Portable.html" title="PlayStation Portable">PlayStation Portable</a> (PSP) (2005 in the US), didn't help the N-Gage. The Nintendo DS is a highly innovative handheld, the PSP is much more powerful and also includes limited media capabilities. In Western countries the consoles have had similar levels of success but in Japan the DS has been a huge hit, vastly outselling the PSP.</p>
<p>The end of 2005 saw the release of the <a href="/wiki/Xbox_360.html" title="Xbox 360">Xbox 360</a> - the first of the seventh generation of video game consoles.</p>

<h3>Publication Cycle</h3>
<p>The process by which new games appear on the market, and what happens to old games, was completely novel, differing from that of books, magazines, television shows, and feature films. There have been old bookstores for centuries, and though magazines are disparaged, they are saved for the information in their articles and also resalable. Television shows have been re-run in domestic markets and often translated to be broadcast in foreign lands decades after their first release. With the appearance of the VHS tape and the DVD, both these shows and cinema have periodically appeared on the market.</p>
<p>Video games primarily live on through the sequel. Unlike movies and books, video games are first and foremost experienced through game play. Successful game play is often reused and updated in new editions on the next generation platform. Because of the cost to develop a title, studios often prefer to reuse successful characters and game engines. Examples of popular franchises titles include John Madden Football, Super Mario Bros., Mega Man, Legend of Zelda, and Metroid. Nintendo is well known for placing its most popular characters, also called "mascots", into several different settings such as tennis, racing, and soccer.</p>
<p>Several retailers do stock used games and systems at discounted prices. Occasionally, studios do re-release old titles onto new game platforms (Atari games on Play Station 2 is a notable example).</p>

Wider age groups will play games, as new types of games in other fields appear that appeal to those ages. Games will be used to teach kids and adults (for job training) in school and at home making learning fun and 'hands on', a process that has already begun.

Natural progression of and <a href="/wiki/Consumer.html" title="Consumer">consumer</a> demand for increased complexity has gradually forced game <a href="/wiki/Software_company.html" title="Software company">software companies</a> to be more creative and expansive in their design of new games. Video games have moved forward not only in the visual dimension, but also in the very concept of restrictive goals and objectives of the game.

<p>Games, like most other forms of media, may be categorized into <a href="/wiki/Computer_and_video_game_genres.html" title="Computer and video game genres">genres</a> based on gameplay, atmosphere, and various other factors. In fact, games are often much easier to classify by genre than films, music, or books. Due to gaming's relatively short history, technical limitations, and the commercial pressures currently affecting the North American and Japanese markets, electronic games are ensconced in a period of extreme <a href="/wiki/Formalism.html" title="Formalism">formalism</a>. Recently, video games have begun to explode in popularity, a rise which coincides with an increase in production value, and thus, development cost. As gamers come to expect talented voice acting, enormous, meticulously-constructed worlds and Hollywood-quality sound effects, production costs rise, and owing to the tremendous investment required by publishers (who want to maximize profits), most choose to make games based upon "tried-and-true" ideas, borrowing heavily from previous games and concepts.</p>
<p>This is most evident in the fact that publishers' tend to establish "franchises", which often recycle the same characters, situations, conflicts, gameplay mechanics, and themes for any number of sequels. Therefore, though many games may combine genres, very few exist outside the paradigm of previously established genres, with notable exceptions.</p>

Both <a href="/wiki/India.html" title="India">India</a> and <a href="/wiki/China.html" title="China">China</a> are considered emerging markets in the video game industry and sales are expected to rise significantly in the coming years.</p>
<p>Sales of different types of games vary widely between these markets due to local preferences. Japanese consumers avoid computer games and instead buy video games, with a strong preference for games catering to Japanese tastes. In South Korea, computer games are preferred, especially <a href="/wiki/MMORPG.html" title="MMORPG">MMORPG</a> games and <a href="/wiki/Real-time_strategy.html" title="Real-time strategy">real-time strategy</a> games; there are over 20,000 <a href="/wiki/PC_bang.html" title="PC bang">PC bang</a> Internet cafes where computer games can be played for an hourly charge.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/NPD_Group.html" title="NPD Group">NPD Group</a> tracks computer and video game sales in the United States. It reported that <a href="/wiki/As_of_2004.html" title="As of 2004">as of 2004</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Console and portable software sales: $6.2 billion, up 8% from 2003 <sup id="_ref-sales_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[3]</a></sup></li>
<li>Console and portable hardware and accessory sales: $3.7 billion, down 35% from 2003 <sup id="_ref-sales_1" class="reference"><a  title="">[3]</a></sup></li>
<li>PC game sales: $1.1 billion, down 2% from 2003 <sup id="_ref-ussales_0" class="reference"><a  title="">[4]</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<p>These figures are sales in dollars, not units; unit shipments for each category were higher than the dollar sales numbers indicate, as more software and hardware was sold at reduced prices compared to 2003.</p>
<p>Retail PC game sales have been declining slightly each year since about 1998, but this fact should be taken with a grain of salt: the retail sales numbers from NPD do not include sales from online downloads, nor subscription revenue for games like <a href="/wiki/MMORPG.html" title="MMORPG">MMORPGs</a>.</p>

<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a  title="Edit section: What the player gains">edit</a>]</div>
<p><a name="What_the_player_gains" id="What_the_player_gains"></a></p>
<h3>What the player gains</h3>
<p>Perhaps the most visible values of computer and video gaming are simply its artistic and entertainment values. As a form of <a href="/wiki/Multimedia.html" title="Multimedia">multimedia</a> entertainment, modern video games contain a highly unique fusion of 3D art, CG effects, architecture, artificial intelligence, sound effects, dramatic performances, music, storytelling, and, most importantly, interactivity. This interactivity enables the player to explore what amounts to a stylized, artistic depiction and simulation of some three-dimensional environment (something no other form of entertainment can allow) with the actions of the player operating as a single, irreducable variable. In this respect, every game scenario will play out a slightly different way every time, since the player is a constant variable. Even if the game is highly scripted, this can still feel like a large amount of freedom to the person who is playing the game. Consider, for example, a game such as <a  title="Brothers in Arms: Earned in Blood">Brothers in Arms: Earned in Blood</a>, where the objective is often to eliminate German squads by commanding a group of soldiers from a first-person perpective. Many aspects of the game are highly controlled-- the number of Germans and the places they originate from does not vary, nor does the strength and armament of friendly or enemy troops. The maps are meticulously designed in such a way as to provide clear paths and cover at key locations. And still, the overall strategy, the tactics, and the execution will vary every time. Within the rather broad boundaries of the game, the player is able to exercise far more freedom and control than in traditional forms of entertainment or art.</p>
<p>A related property is that of <a href="/wiki/Emergence.html" title="Emergence">emergent behavior</a>. While many games including card games and sports rely on emergent principals, games are able to create simulated story worlds where emergent behavior occurs within the context of this world. This also is very appealing to players. In discussing the issue, game designer <a href="/wiki/Warren_Spector.html" title="Warren Spector">Warren Spector</a> has used the term "emergent narrative" to describe how, in a simulated environment, storyline can be created simply by "what happens to the player." <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://xbox.ign.com/articles/502/502409p1.html">[1]</a></p>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/Steven_Berlin_Johnson.html" title="Steven Berlin Johnson">Steven Johnson's book</a>, "<a href="/wiki/Everything_Bad_Is_Good_For_You.html" title="Everything Bad Is Good For You">Everything Bad Is Good For You</a>," he argues that video games in fact demand far more from a player than traditional games like Monopoly. In order to experience the game, the player must first determine the objectives, as well as how to complete them. They must then learn the game controls and how the human-machine interface works, including menus and <a href="/wiki/HUD_%28computer_gaming%29.html" title="HUD (computer gaming)">HUDs</a>. Beyond such skills, which after some time become quite fundamental and are taken for granted by many gamers, video games are based upon the player navigating (and eventually mastering) a highly complex system with many variables. This requires a strong analytical ability, as well as flexibility and adaptability. To emphasize the point, Johnson notes that that the strategy guide for <a href="/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto_III.html" title="Grand Theft Auto III">Grand Theft Auto III</a> is 53,000 words long. He argues that the process of learning the boundaries, goals, and controls of a given game is often a highly demanding one that calls on many different areas of cognitive function. Indeed, most games require a great deal of patience and focus from the player, and, contrary to the popular perception that games provide instant gratification, games actually delay gratification far longer than other forms of entertainment such as film or even many books. <a  class="external autonumber" title="http://www.newyorker.com/critics/books/articles/050516crbo_books">[2]</a> Some research<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a  title="">[5]</a></sup> suggests videogames may even increase player's attention capacities.</p>
<p>Multiplayer games, which take advantage of the fact that computer games can use the internet, provide players with the opportunity to compete with other players from across the globe, something that is also unique to electronic gaming. <a href="/wiki/MMORPG.html" title="MMORPG">MMORPG's</a> take the concept much further with the establishment of vast, online communities existing in persistent, virtual worlds. Millions of players around the globe are attracted to video gaming simply because it offers such unprecedented ability to interact with large numbers of people engaged simultaneously in a structured environment where they are all involved in the same activity (playing the game).</p>
<p>Even simple games offer potential benefits to the player. Games like <a href="/wiki/Tetris.html" title="Tetris">Tetris</a> and <a href="/wiki/Pac-man.html" title="Pac-man">Pac-man</a> are well-designed games that are easy to pick up but difficult to master, in ways not unlike <a href="/wiki/Chess.html" title="Chess">chess</a> or even <a href="/wiki/Poker.html" title="Poker">poker</a>. Despite their simplicity, simple games may also feature online capabilities or powerful AI. Depending on the game, players can develop and test their techniques against an advanced computer player or online against other human players.</p>
<p>More obvious benefits to the player can come in the form education on the game's subject matter. For example, a <a href="/wiki/Real_Time_Strategy.html" title="Real Time Strategy">RTS</a> set during the <a href="/wiki/American_Civil_War.html" title="American Civil War">American Civil War</a> may feature the use of period armies engaging in historical battles, and outwitting an opponent such as <a href="/wiki/Robert_E._Lee.html" title="Robert E. Lee">Robert E. Lee</a>.</p>

The scene from <i><a href="/wiki/Night_Trap.html" title="Night Trap">Night Trap</a></i> which sparked controversy in 1992</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Like related forms of media, computer and video games have been the subject of frequent controversy and <a href="/wiki/Censorship.html" title="Censorship">censorship</a>, due to the depiction of graphic <a href="/wiki/Violence.html" title="Violence">violence</a>, <a href="/wiki/Sex.html" title="Sex">sexual themes</a>, <a href="/wiki/Advertising.html" title="Advertising">advertising</a>, consumption of illegal <a href="/wiki/Recreational_drug_use.html" title="Recreational drug use">drugs</a>, consumption of <a href="/wiki/Alcoholic_beverage.html" title="Alcoholic beverage">alcohol</a> or <a href="/wiki/Tobacco.html" title="Tobacco">tobacco</a>, <a href="/wiki/Propaganda.html" title="Propaganda">propaganda</a>, or <a href="/wiki/Profanity.html" title="Profanity">profanity</a> in some games. Among others, critics of video games sometimes include parents' groups, <a href="/wiki/Politician.html" title="Politician">politicians</a>, organized <a href="/wiki/Religion.html" title="Religion">religion</a> groups, and other <a href="/wiki/Special_interest.html" title="Special interest">special interest</a> groups, even though all these can be found in all forms of entertainment and media. Various games have been accused of causing <a href="/wiki/Addiction.html" title="Addiction">addiction</a> to such and even <a href="/wiki/Violence.html" title="Violence">violent</a> behavior.</p>
<p><i>Video game censorship</i> is defined as the use of state or group power to control the playing, distribution, purchase, or sale of video games or computer games. Video game controversy comes in many forms, and censorship is a controversial subject, as well as a popular topic of debate. Proponents and opponents of censorship are often very passionate about their individual views.</p>
<p>Historically, this type of controversy and criticism is not unique to video games. The same situation has been applied to <a href="/wiki/Comic_books.html" title="Comic books">Comic books</a>, <a href="/wiki/Production_Code.html" title="Production Code">motion pictures</a> and to some extent <a href="/wiki/PMRC.html" title="PMRC">music</a>. Moreover, it appears to be a question of age. Since these art forms have been around longer, the backlash against them occurred farther in the past, beyond the remembrance of today's youth. In both cases, the attempts at censorship in the <a href="/wiki/United_States.html" title="United States">United States</a> were struck down as a violation of <a href="/wiki/First_Amendment.html" title="First Amendment">First Amendment</a> <a href="/wiki/Rights.html" title="Rights">rights</a>, and they have gone on to become fully integrated facets of society.</p>
<p>Games that have sparked notable national controversy in the United States include <i><a href="/wiki/Mortal_Kombat.html" title="Mortal Kombat">Mortal Kombat</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Night_Trap.html" title="Night Trap">Night Trap</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Doom.html" title="Doom">Doom</a></i>, the <i><a href="/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto_%28series%29.html" title="Grand Theft Auto (series)">Grand Theft Auto</a></i> series and, most notably, <i><a  title="Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas">Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas</a>'</i> infamous <a href="/wiki/Hot_Coffee_mod.html" title="Hot Coffee mod">Hot Coffee mod</a> fiasco which boosted the game's <a href="/wiki/ESRB.html" title="ESRB">ESRB</a> rating from M (Mature) to AO (Adults Only).</p>

<p>Video games are made by <a href="/wiki/Video_game_developer.html" title="Video game developer">developers</a>, who used to do this as individuals or small teams in the 80's. Now, development commonly requires a large team consisting of <a href="/wiki/Game_designer.html" title="Game designer">designers</a>, <a href="/wiki/Graphic_design.html" title="Graphic design">graphic designers</a> and other <a href="/wiki/Artist.html" title="Artist">artists</a>, <a href="/wiki/Game_programmer.html" title="Game programmer">programmers</a>, <a href="/wiki/Sound_design.html" title="Sound design">sound designers</a>, <a href="/wiki/Musician.html" title="Musician">musicians</a>, and other technicians; all of which are managed by <a href="/wiki/Game_producer.html" title="Game producer">producers</a>. The visionary for any game may come from any of the roles outlined. Development by committee rarely works.</p>
<p>With the start of the 21st century we can see a major boom in the numbers of game developing teams and studios. This business, although tough and risky, proves to be a goldmine for the determined groups. Previous industry giants like EA Games, Valve, and Rockstar are slowly being displaced by newer studios with smaller budgets yet more determined and younger members who have developed a passion for video gaming throughout their whole lives. Most of these studios are modding existing engines and games until they get enough media attention and sponsors to start a new project from scratch. Prime examples of such teams are Dimension Studios and Turtle Rock Studios. Both of these provide content for already existing games and are making a fortune out of it. An older team, Gearbox Software, started out in a similar fashion by modding the original Half-Life engine; now it is one of the major video game developers.</p>
<p>Video games are developing fast in all areas, but the problem is of cost, and how developers intend to keep the costs low enough to attract publisher investment. Most video game console development teams number anywhere from 20 to 50 people, with some teams exceeding 100. The average team size as well as the average development time of a game have grown along with the size of the industry and the technology involved in creating games. This has led to regular occurrences of missed deadlines and unfinished products; <i><a href="/wiki/Duke_Nukem_Forever.html" title="Duke Nukem Forever">Duke Nukem Forever</a></i> is the quintessential example of these problems. <i>See also: <a href="/wiki/Video_game_industry_practices.html" title="Video game industry practices">video game industry practices</a></i>.</p>

<p>Games running on a PC are often designed with end-user modifications in mind, and this consequently allows modern computer games to be modified by gamers without much difficulty. These <a href="/wiki/Mod_%28computer_gaming%29.html" title="Mod (computer gaming)">mods</a> can add an extra dimension of replayability and interest. The <a href="/wiki/Internet.html" title="Internet">Internet</a> provides an inexpensive medium to promote and distribute mods, and they have become an increasingly important factor in the commercial success of some games. Developers such as <a href="/wiki/Id_Software.html" title="Id Software">id</a>, <a href="/wiki/Valve_Software.html" title="Valve Software">Valve</a>, <a href="/wiki/Crytek.html" title="Crytek">Crytek</a> and <a href="/wiki/Epic_Games.html" title="Epic Games">Epic</a> ship their games with the very development tools used to make the game in the first place, along with documentation to assist mod developers, which allows for the kind of success seen by popular mods such as <i><a href="/wiki/Counter-Strike.html" title="Counter-Strike">Counter-Strike</a></i>.</p>
<p>Popular mods are very occasionally bought by the developers of the game. This was the case with Valve's <i><a href="/wiki/Half-Life.html" title="Half-Life">Half-Life</a></i>. Valve bought a number of popular mods including <i><a href="/wiki/Counter-Strike.html" title="Counter-Strike">Counter-Strike</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Day_of_Defeat.html" title="Day of Defeat">Day of Defeat</a></i>. After the release of <i><a href="/wiki/Half-Life_2.html" title="Half-Life 2">Half-Life 2</a></i> Valve developed these mods for the sequel and sold them through their Internet <a href="/wiki/Digital_distribution.html" title="Digital distribution">digital distribution</a> software, <a href="/wiki/Steam_%28content_delivery%29.html" title="Steam (content delivery)">Steam</a>.</p>

<h2>Naming</h2>
<p>Non-gamers use several <a href="/wiki/Umbrella_term.html" title="Umbrella term">umbrella terms</a> for console, PC, arcade, handheld, and similar games since they do not agree on the best name. For many, either "computer game" or "video game" describes these games as a whole. Other commonly used terms include "entertainment software," "interactive entertainment media," "electronic interactive entertainment," "electronic game," "software game," and "videogame" (as one word). Gamers are quite happy to use the vague term "games", or "videogame/video game" to distinguish them from board games and card games when necessary. In the past, it was common for parents and/or elderly people, who were unfamiliar with video games, to refer to all of them as "<a href="/wiki/Nintendo.html" title="Nintendo">Nintendo</a> games" due to Nintendo's overwhelming popularity in the late 80's and 90's (this is comparable to the public referring to all brands of <a href="/wiki/Facial_tissue.html" title="Facial tissue">facial tissue</a> as <a href="/wiki/Kleenex.html" title="Kleenex">Kleenex</a>). Computer and video games are a subset of <a href="/wiki/Interactive_media.html" title="Interactive media">interactive media</a>, which includes <a href="/wiki/Virtual_reality.html" title="Virtual reality">virtual reality</a>, <a href="/wiki/Flight_simulators.html" title="Flight simulators">flight</a> and <a href="/wiki/Engineering.html" title="Engineering">engineering</a> simulation, <a href="/wiki/Multimedia.html" title="Multimedia">multimedia</a> and the <a href="/wiki/World_Wide_Web.html" title="World Wide Web">World Wide Web</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="/wiki/Dreamcast.html" title="Dreamcast">Dreamcast</a>, the first of the sixth generation video games consoles, was released by <a href="/wiki/Sega.html" title="Sega">Sega</a> in Japan in 1998, and in the <a href="/wiki/United_States.html" title="United States">U.S.</a> and <a href="/wiki/Europe.html" title="Europe">Europe</a> in 1999. This did not play DVDs, which were still quite new and expensive and relatively unpopular at the time. Instead, it used a proprietary 1 Gb 4.75 inch disc known as a <a href="/wiki/GD-ROM.html" title="GD-ROM">GD-ROM</a> disc. By 2000, DVD was becoming more popular and a <a href="/wiki/Redesign.html" title="Redesign">redesign</a> was mooted to add in DVD capabilities.

Despite many reports of poor and bad playback and green screens<sup title="The text in the vicinity of this tag needs citation." class="noprint">[<a  title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><i>citation&#160;needed</i></a>]</sup>, this proved popular and was often used as a primary DVD player until the prices of good standalone players went down.<sup title="The text in the vicinity of this tag needs citation." class="noprint">[<a  title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><i>citation&#160;needed</i></a>]</sup> In keeping with this approach, <a href="/wiki/Sony.html" title="Sony">Sony</a> will incorporate Sony's competing successor to DVD, <a href="/wiki/Blu-ray_Disc.html" title="Blu-ray Disc">Blu-ray</a>, into its next console, the <a href="/wiki/PlayStation_3.html" title="PlayStation 3">PlayStation 3</a>.
